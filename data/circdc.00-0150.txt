Circuit Judges.

             Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Ginsburg.

     Ginsburg, Circuit Judge:  Phoenix Consulting sued the 
Republic of Angola for breach of contract, and Angola moved 
to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 
28 U.S.C. ss 1330, 1602-1611.  The district court, accepting 
as true for purposes of the motion the plaintiff's allegation 
that Angola had executed a contractual waiver of immunity, 
denied Angola's motion.  Angola appeals from the court's 
order.

     Because Angola's motion to dismiss raised a factual chal-
lenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction under the 
FSIA, the district court erred in accepting as true the 
jurisdictional facts alleged by the plaintiff.  Instead, the court 
should have settled any contested jurisdictional facts neces-
sary to decide Angola's motion to dismiss.  We therefore 
remand the matter to the district court for further proceed-
ings consistent with this opinion.

                          I. Background

     Phoenix Consulting, Inc., a United States affiliate of Phoe-
nix Holdings, Ltd. of the United Kingdom (hereinafter col-
lectively referred to as Phoenix), entered into an agency 
contract with Eduardo Neto Sangueve.  Sangueve was au-
thorized to negotiate the sale to the Republic of Angola of a 
prefabricated building owned by Phoenix and stored in An-
gola.

     Sangueve proposed the sale in a meeting with Jose Anibal 
Rocha, Angola's Minister of Territorial Administration.  The 
outcome of this meeting and the subsequent chain of events 
are disputed by the parties.  Phoenix claims that Rocha, on 
behalf of Angola, contracted to purchase the building for 
$325,000 (U.S.), and that Angola had its agents remove the 
building from storage but never paid for it.  Angola, in 
contrast, maintains that Rocha merely took Phoenix's propos-
al under consideration, and that neither he nor any other 
Angolan official contracted to purchase the building.  Angola 
professes to have no knowledge of who removed the building 
from storage.

     Phoenix filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of 
Columbia claiming Angola had breached its contract or, alter-
natively, had converted Phoenix's property or been unjustly 
enriched.  After default judgment was entered in favor of 
Phoenix, Angola removed the case to the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia.  Angola then 
successfully moved the district court to vacate the default 
judgment and, prior to filing an answer to the complaint, 
moved to dismiss for, among other reasons, lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.  In response, Phoenix 
invoked three exceptions to immunity under the FSIA, any 
one of which would provide the district court with subject 
matter jurisdiction:  waiver, 28 U.S.C. s 1605(a)(1);  commer-
cial activity, id. s 1605(a)(2);  and a taking of property in 
violation of international law, id. s 1605(a)(3).  In support of 
the waiver exception, Phoenix proffered evidence that Rocha, 
as Angola's agent, had executed a written sales contract 
containing a choice of law provision subjecting the contract to 
the jurisdiction and laws of the United States--which, accord-
ing to the legislative history of the FSIA, would by implica-
tion have waived Angola's immunity from suit.  See H.R. Rep. 
No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 
6604, 6616-17.  Angola replied with Rocha's sworn declara-
tion that the signature on the written contract was a forgery 
and that Angola had never agreed to any contract, much less 
one containing a waiver provision.

     The district court denied Angola's motion to dismiss.  First 
it held that the choice of law provision would constitute a 
waiver of sovereign immunity.  Then, stating that "[o]n mo-
tion to dismiss, the court is to consider all allegations of 
jurisdictional facts in [the plaintiff's] favor," the court con-
cluded that Phoenix's allegation that Angola had executed the 
written contract would, if proven, establish that Angola had 
waived its sovereign immunity.

     Angola brings this interlocutory appeal of the district 
court's order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 1291 and the collateral 
order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 
U.S. 541 (1949).  See Jungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khali-
fa, 115 F.3d 1020, 1025-26 (D.C. Cir. 1997);  Foremost-

McKesson, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 905 F.2d 438, 443 
(D.C. Cir. 1990).  Upon appeal, Angola raises only the follow-
ing question of law:  May a district court resolve a sovereign 
defendant's factual challenge to the court's subject matter 
jurisdiction under the FSIA by accepting as true the plain-
tiff's allegations of jurisdictional facts?

                           II. Analysis

     Under the FSIA a foreign state is immune from the 
jurisdiction of both the federal and the state courts, except as 
provided by international agreements, see 28 U.S.C. 
s 1330(a);  id. s 1604, by nine specifically enumerated excep-
tions, see id. s 1605(a)(1)-(7), (b), (d), and by certain other 
exceptions relating to counterclaims in actions brought by the 
foreign state itself, see id. s 1607.  If no exception applies, a 
foreign sovereign's immunity under the FSIA is complete:  
The district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the 
plaintiff's case, see id. s 1330(a).  Thus the sovereign has "an 
immunity from trial and the attendant burdens of litigation, 
and not just a defense to liability on the merits."  Foremost-
McKesson, 905 F.2d at 443.  In order to preserve the full 
scope of that immunity, the district court must make the 
"critical preliminary determination" of its own jurisdiction as 
early in the litigation as possible;  to defer the question is to 
"frustrate the significance and benefit of entitlement to immu-
nity from suit."  Id. at 449.

     The FSIA establishes a specific framework for determining 
whether a sovereign is immune from suit and consequently 
whether the district court has jurisdiction.  As a threshold 
matter, if the sovereign makes a "conscious decision to take 
part in the litigation," then it must assert its immunity under 
the FSIA either before or in its responsive pleading. 
Foremost-McKesson, 905 F.2d at 443-45.  This requirement 
holds even though FSIA immunity is jurisdictional because 
failure to assert the immunity after consciously deciding to 
participate in the litigation may constitute an implied waiver 
of immunity, 28 U.S.C. s 1605(a)(1), which invests the court 
with subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. s 1330(a).  

See H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976), reprinted in 1976 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6616-17.*

     Once the defendant has asserted the jurisdictional defense 
of immunity under the FSIA, the court's focus shifts to the 
exceptions to immunity laid out in 28 U.S.C. ss 1604, 1605, 
and 1607.  "In accordance with the restrictive view of sover-
eign immunity reflected in the FSIA," the defendant bears 
the burden of proving that the plaintiff's allegations do not 
bring its case within a statutory exception to immunity.  
Transamerican S.S. Corp. v. Somali Democratic Republic, 
767 F.2d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1985);  see Princz v. Federal 
Republic of Germany, 26 F.3d 1166, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  
By moving to dismiss, the defendant may challenge either the 
legal sufficiency or the factual underpinning of an exception, 
and how the district court proceeds to resolve the motion to 
dismiss depends upon whether the motion presents a factual 
challenge.

     If the defendant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the 
plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations, then the district court 
should take the plaintiff's factual allegations as true and 
determine whether they bring the case within any of the 
exceptions to immunity invoked by the plaintiff.  See, e.g., 
Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 351, 361 (1993) (disput-
ed allegations forming basis for suit, even if true, not "com-
mercial activity" within meaning of exception therefor);  
Princz, 26 F.3d at 1172 (disputed allegations of use of U.S. 
mail and banking system, even if true, not "direct effect in the 
United States" of commercial activity within meaning of 
exception);  Foremost-McKesson, 905 F.2d at 450 (undisputed

     * This court has not yet addressed whether and upon what facts 
"the intentionality requirement implicit in s 1605(a)(1)," Princz v. 
Federal Republic of Germany, 26 F.3d 1166, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1994), 
might allow a sovereign defendant to claim immunity after con-
sciously deciding to take part in the proceeding and filing a respon-
sive pleading.  See Alpha Therapeutic Corp. v. Nippon Hoso Kyo-
kai, 199 F.3d 1078 (9th Cir. 1999) (no waiver where in-house counsel 
of public broadcaster, unaware of pleading requirement when filing 
answer, raised FSIA promptly upon discovering requirement less 
than three months after complaint filed).

allegations of "commercial activity" adequate to survive mo-
tion to dismiss).  In some cases, however, the motion to 
dismiss will present a dispute over the factual basis of the 
court's subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, that is, 
either contest a jurisdictional fact alleged by the plaintiff, see, 
e.g., Filetech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 931-
32 (2d Cir. 1998) (factual dispute whether sufficient commer-
cial activity for jurisdiction), or raise a mixed question of law 
and fact, see, e.g., Foremost-McKesson, 905 F.2d at 448-49 
(dispute whether person alleged to have harmed plaintiff was 
agent of sovereign).  When the defendant has thus challenged 
the factual basis of the court's jurisdiction, the court may not 
deny the motion to dismiss merely by assuming the truth of 
the facts alleged by the plaintiff and disputed by the defen-
dant.  Instead, the court must go beyond the pleadings and 
resolve any disputed issues of fact the resolution of which is 
necessary to a ruling upon the motion to dismiss.  See 
Jungquist, 115 F.3d at 1027-28;  Foremost-McKesson, 905 
F.2d at 448-49;  see also Filetech, 157 F.3d at 932;  Moran v. 
Saudi Arabia, 27 F.3d 169, 172 (5th Cir. 1994);  Gould v. 
Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann, 853 F.2d 445, 451 (6th Cir. 1988);  
cf. Herbert v. National Academy of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 
197-98 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (affirming district court's resolution of 
disputed facts necessary for subject matter jurisdiction under 
Copyright Act).  The district court retains "considerable lati-
tude in devising the procedures it will follow to ferret out the 
facts pertinent to jurisdiction," but it must give the plaintiff 
"ample opportunity to secure and present evidence relevant 
to the existence of jurisdiction."  Prakash v. American Uni-
versity, 727 F.2d 1174, 1179-80 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  In order to 
avoid burdening a sovereign that proves to be immune from 
suit, however, jurisdictional discovery should be carefully 
controlled and limited, see Foremost-McKesson, 905 F.2d at 
449;  it should not be authorized at all if the defendant raises 
either a different jurisdictional or an "other non-merits 
ground[ ] such as forum non-conveniens [or] personal jurisdic-
tion" the resolution of which would impose a lesser burden 
upon the defendant, In re Papandreou, 139 F.3d 247, 254-55 
(D.C. Cir. 1998).

     With these principles in mind, we see that in ruling upon 
Angola's motion to dismiss the district court erred by assum-
ing the truth of an allegation of jurisdictional fact contested 
by the defendant.  When Angola asserted immunity under 
the FSIA, Phoenix invoked the waiver exception thereto and 
presented evidence that Angola had executed a written con-
tract waiving its immunity under the FSIA.  Angola respond-
ed with a challenge to the facts upon which Phoenix relied for 
the waiver exception:  It presented evidence that the written 
contract was a forgery and that it had never agreed to waive 
its immunity from suit.  The district court was required to 
resolve this factual dispute material to its subject matter 
jurisdiction;  and in order to preserve the significance and 
benefit of a foreign sovereign's immunity from suit under the 
FSIA, the court could not "postpon[e] the determination of 
subject matter jurisdiction until some point during or after 
trial."  Gould, 853 F.2d at 451.  We therefore remand this 
matter to the district court for further consideration whether 
it has subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.

                                  III. Conclusion

     For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is 
reversed in part and the case remanded for further proceed-
ings consistent with this opinion.

                                                                       So ordered.
