            Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge 
Williams.

     Williams, Senior Circuit Judge:  Petitioner ACS of An-
chorage, Inc. challenges a Federal Communications Commis-
sion order finding that ACS exceeded its permissible rate of 
return for 1997-98.  As a remedy, the Commission ordered 
ACS to pay damages plus prejudgment interest to a com-
plaining customer, General Communications, Inc. ("GCI").  
See In re General Communication, Inc. v. Alaska Communi-
cations Systems Holdings, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, FCC 01-32, at 2, p 1 (Jan. 24, 2001) ("Order");  id. at 
31, p 77.  ACS poses three claims.  First, it says that the 
Commission erroneously required it to allocate to its intra-
state services the traffic-sensitive costs associated with calls 
to internet service providers ("ISPs").  Second, it argues that 
even if the Commission were right on that issue, ACS's filing 
of tariffs under 47 U.S.C. s 204(a)(3), a provision for "stream-
lined tariffs," barred any damages for overcharges for the 
period those tariffs were in effect, namely calendar year 1998.  
See In re Implementation of Section 402(b)(1)(A) of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Report and Order, 12 FCC 
Rcd 2170 (1997) ("Streamlined Tariff Order").  Third, as to 
any damages that were due, ACS challenges the rate chosen 
by the FCC for calculating prejudgment interest.  We deny 
ACS's petition on the first issue, grant its petition on the 
second, and remand for further proceedings on the third.

     ACS is the incumbent local exchange carrier ("LEC") in 
Anchorage, Alaska.  Order at 3, p 4.  As a "rate-of-return" 
carrier (i.e., one whose rates are limited in terms of the rate 
of return rather than via price caps, see 47 C.F.R. s 65.1(b)), 
ACS files tariff rates for a two-year period, 47 C.F.R. 
s 69.3(a);  the rates must be chosen with a view to yielding a 
rate of return no greater than the Commission-prescribed 
maximum.  See In re Amendment of Parts 65 and 69 of the 
Commission's Rules to Reform the Interstate Rate of Return 
Represcription and Enforcement Processes, 10 FCC Rcd 
6788, 6791-94, p p 7-12, 6847-48, p 135 (1995).  In addition, 
such carriers periodically submit monitoring reports showing 
their actual rates of return.  47 C.F.R. s 65.600.  These 
reports may lead carriers to file revised rates, see 47 C.F.R. 
s 69.3(b), or cause the Commission to start proceedings un-
der 47 U.S.C. s 205 to prescribe new rates "to be thereafter 
followed."

     Three tariff filings by ACS are pertinent.  In April 1996 it 
filed tariff rates for the two-year period from July 1, 1996 to 
June 30, 1998 (the "1997 Tariff"), and in December 1997 a 
"mid-course correction" tariff covering the balance of that 
period (January 1, 1998 to June 30, 1998) (the "January 1998 
Tariff").  See 47 C.F.R. s 69.3(b) (permitting mid-course 
corrections);  Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. FCC, 10 
F.3d 892, 893-94 & n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (describing use of 
mid-course corrections).  ACS filed the January 1998 Tariff 
under the streamlined tariff provisions of 47 U.S.C. 
s 204(a)(3), which in this instance required a 15-day notice 
period.  Order at 4, p 8.  During this notice period, apparent-
ly, the Commission took no action to suspend the tariffs and 
initiate a hearing on the rates, see 47 U.S.C. s 204(a)(3) 
(cross-referencing 47 U.S.C. s 204(a)(1)), and the tariffs went 
into effect without any hearing being ordered.

     In June 1998, ACS filed its rates for the two-year period 
from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2000 (the "July 1998 Tariff"), 
also pursuant to the streamlined tariff provisions.  The July 
1998 Tariff, however, allocated to ACS's interstate service the 

traffic-sensitive switching costs associated with ISP calls.  
Order at 5, p 9.  Previously, ACS had treated ISP calls as 
intrastate.  See id. at 5, p 8 & n.18;  see also ACS Br. at 15.  
This accounting change had the effect of increasing ACS's 
reported interstate costs, thereby making its expected rate of 
return lower than it otherwise would have been.  See Order 
at 17, p 39.  Again, however, the Commission took no action 
during the notice period, and the tariffs went into effect 
without any hearing being ordered.

     In September 1999, ACS filed its final monitoring report 
for the two-year period from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 
1998.1  The report continued to classify ISP-related traffic as 
interstate.  Anchorage Telephone Utility, Rate of Return 
Report (Sept. 30, 1999);  Order at 6, p 11.  Had ISP costs 
been classified as intrastate, ACS's cumulative rate of return 
would have been 26.66% or 32.12% (depending on other 
accounting practices not challenged here), see Order at 6, 
p 12;  Responses of Alaska Communications Systems Holding, 
Inc. and ACS of Anchorage, Inc. to Interrogatories, In re 
General Communication, Inc. v. Alaska Communications 
Systems Holdings Inc., File No. EB-00-MD-016, at ex. 1 
(Oct. 20, 2000), well in excess of the prescribed maximum rate 
of return of 11.65%, see In re Represcribing the Authorized 
Rate of Return for Interstate Services of Local Exchange 
Carriers, 5 FCC Rcd 7507, p 1 (1990) (prescribing maximum 
rate of return of 11.25%);  47 C.F.R. s 65.700(a) (stating that 
maximum allowable rate of return for any access service 
category is the prescribed rate of return plus 0.4%).

     In August 2000, GCI filed a complaint with the Commission 
alleging that ACS had improperly calculated its interstate 
costs by treating ISP calls as interstate, and had violated its 
prescribed rate of return during the 1997-98 monitoring 
period.  Order at 6-7, p 13.  The Commission agreed with 
GCI, id. at 10, p 22, 20, p 48, and ordered ACS to pay 

__________
     1  Commission regulations specify two-year monitoring reports 
running with the calendar year, even though the tariffs are filed for 
periods starting July 1.  Compare 47 C.F.R. s 69.3(a) (specifying 
periodicity for rate-of-return monitoring reports), with 47 C.F.R. 

damages of about $2.7 million plus prejudgment interest 
assessed at the Internal Revenue Service's corporate over-
payment rate, id. at 31, p 77.

     Petitioning for review, ACS challenges the Commission's 
classification of ISP calls, its failure to treat the s 204(a)(3) 
tariff filings as a bar to damages for 1998, and the rate 
selected for prejudgment interest.

                             *  *  *

     ISP calls classification.  Because the same telecommunica-
tions equipment is often used for both intrastate and inter-
state communications, carriers must apportion their costs (for 
regulatory purposes) through what is called the "separations" 
process.  See generally 47 C.F.R. ss 36.1-36.3.  ACS argues 
that because FCC has previously recognized ISP calls as 
interstate for jurisdictional purposes under its "end-to-end" 
analysis, e.g., In re Implementation of the Local Competition 
Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 14 FCC 
Rcd 3689, 3695-3703, p p 10-20 ("Reciprocal Compensation 
Order"), ISP calls should be interstate for separations pur-
poses as well.

     Of course, generally speaking, separations will follow juris-
diction.  This basic norm is inherent in the separations for-
mulas found at 47 C.F.R. s 36.125(a)(3), (a)(5) & (b), the 
Supreme Court's decision in Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 
282 U.S. 133, 150-51 (1930), and our decision in MCI Tele-
communications Corp. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 135, 137, 140-41 
(D.C. Cir. 1984).  But practical considerations may justify 
divergent treatment--at least temporarily.  See Smith, 282 
U.S. at 150 (recognizing the "practical difficulty of dividing 
the property between interstate and intrastate services" and 
requiring "only reasonable measures" for separation).  In-
deed, in MCI, we explicitly upheld a deviation from the 
jurisdictional norm where the Commission was implementing 
(a) an interim ratemaking solution (b) justified by a substan-
tial policy objective.  MCI, 750 F.2d at 140-41.
     
   While the Order does not explicitly invoke the MCI excep-
tion, we can reasonably discern the path from its reasoning

ports).

and citations.  See Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. 
Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285-86 
(1974);  Syracuse Peace Council v. FCC, 867 F.2d 654, 665 
(D.C. Cir. 1989).  The interim nature of the decision is quite 
explicit--and, of course, a natural concomitant of the novelty 
of the internet itself.  Compare, e.g., WorldCom v. FCC, No. 
01-1218, 2002 WL 832541 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2002).  As the 
Order explains, the Commission views its treatment of ISP 
calls as derivative of its policy exempting ISPs and other 
enhanced service providers ("ESPs") from paying interstate 
"access" charges--the charges normally paid by an interex-
change carrier ("IXC") such as AT&T and MCI for access to 
the LECs originating and terminating an interexchange call.  
Order at 8, p 17, 14, p 32.  Insofar as the ESP exemption is 
clearly temporary, it follows that the intrastate classification 
would be as well.  See, e.g., id.;  In re Amendments of Part 
69 of the Commission's Rules Relating to the Creation of 
Access Charge Subelements for Open Network Architecture, 
Report and Order, 6 FCC Rcd 4524, 4535, p 60 (1991) ("ONA 
Order") (retaining exemption temporarily to provide stability 
during open tariff architecture reforms);  In re Amendments 
of Part 69 of the Commission's Rules Relating to Enhanced 
Service Providers, 3 FCC Rcd 2631, 2631 p 2 (1988) ("ESP 
Exemption Order") (characterizing ESP exemption as a tem-
porary measure to avoid "unduly" burdening the ISP indus-
try).  Furthermore, recent letters issued by the Commission's 
Common Carrier Bureau explicitly note that the intrastate 
classification "is an interim measure only."  Common Carrier 
Bureau Issues Letter to Bell Atlantic Regarding Jurisdic-
tional Separations Treatment of Reciprocal Compensation 
for Internet Traffic, Public Notice, 14 FCC Rcd 13148, 13148 
(1999);  see also Common Carrier Bureau Issues Letter to 
SBC Regarding Its Jurisdictional Separations Treatment of 
Internet Traffic, Public Notice, 14 FCC Rcd 8178, 8180 n.9 
(1999).

     The Commission's primary policy justification for the intra-
state classification matches the language it has used for the 
ESP exemption.  Rather than directly exempting ESPs from 
interstate access charges, the Commission defined them as 

"end users"--no different from a local pizzeria or barber 
shop.  See Order at 16, p 37;  In re Amendments of Part 69 of 
the Commission's Rules Relating to the Creation of Access 
Charge Subelements for Open Network Architecture, Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking, 4 FCC Rcd 3983, 3988, p 39 & n.89 
(1989) ("ONA NPRM");  see also 47 C.F.R. s 69.2(m).  While 
this categorization exempted ISPs from interstate access 
charges paid by IXCs, it left them obliged to purchase access 
through intrastate tariffs--namely, local business line 
charges.  The Commission contends that ACS's allocation of 
ISP costs to interstate service would thus create a cost-
revenue mismatch.  Order at 14-16, p p 32-37.  The tariff 
revenue would be allocated to intrastate and the costs to 
interstate, disrupting rate-of-return calculations.

     Once the Commission has allotted the revenue to intrastate 
service, plainly it makes sense to allocate the costs there as 
well.  But that might be said merely to relocate the question:  
as the functional significance of the ESP exemption is to 
channel the revenue to intrastate service, one might ask if 
such an allocation was reasonable.  Indeed, ACS's brief ad-
dresses the cost-revenue matching principle in economic 
terms, i.e., the proposition that, in the interest of aligning 
incentives correctly, costs should be borne by the customers 
who cause them to be incurred.  See Union Elec. Co. v. 
FERC, 890 F.2d 1193, 1198 (D.C. 1989).  Noting that in 
creating the ESP exemption the Commission had recognized 
that it would cause economic distortions, making non-ESP 
users of interstate access bear disproportionate costs, ACS 
argues that the Commission cannot now rely on the cost-
revenue matching principle.  See ACS Br. at 34 (citing ESP 
Exemption Order, 3 FCC Rcd at 2631, p 2).  But the Com-
mission needn't rely on the economic cost-revenue principle.  
All it invokes is a more modest principle of regulatory orderli-
ness.  And because we must take the ESP exemption as 
given, with its concomitant potential for economic distortions, 
the principle of regulatory orderliness indeed supports the 
Commission.

     We are left, then, with the Commission matching its sepa-
rations treatment of costs for ISP-bound calls with its classifi-
cation of those calls for tariffing and revenue purposes.  

Further, not only is the latter unchallenged here, but the 
Commission appears to be working on a number of intercon-
nected parts of the puzzle.  The ESP exemption itself is 
temporary.  And the Commission has set out to reform the 
regime to which it is an exception, the regime of interstate 
access charges, see Order at 14, p 32;  In re Access Charge 
Reform, First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 15982, 16133, 
p 345 (1997), and is investigating future regulatory schemes 
for ISPs, In re Usage of Public Switched Network by Infor-
mation Service and Internet Access Providers, Notice of 
Inquiry, 11 FCC Rcd 21354, 21490-93, p p 311-18 (1996).  
Further, it is fundamentally rethinking the separations pro-
cess in light of ISPs and other market changes.  In re 
Jurisdictional Separations Reform and Referral to the 
Federal-State Joint Board, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
12 FCC Rcd 22120 (1997);  see also Report Filed by State 
Members of Joint Board of Jurisdictional Separations, Pub-
lic Notice, 14 FCC Rcd 3482 (1999).  Clearly, as we stated in 
MCI, the Commission is entitled to substantial deference 
"when it acts to maintain the status quo so that the objectives 
of a pending rulemaking proceeding will not be frustrated," 
MCI, 750 F.2d at 141, including the objective of implementing 
large-scale revisions "in a manner that would cause the least 
upheaval in the industry," id.  Accordingly, we cannot find 
the Commission's interim intrastate classification of ISP-
related costs to be arbitrary or capricious.

     Damages for rates filed in "streamlined tariffs".  ACS 
next argues that 47 U.S.C. s 204(a)(3), as elaborated upon by 
the Commission in its Streamlined Tariff Order, is a bar to 
damages for its purported overcharges in 1998.  47 U.S.C. 
s 204(a)(3), part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
states:

     A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a 
     new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or prac-
     tice on a streamlined basis.  Any such charge, classifica-
     tion, regulation, or practice shall be deemed lawful and 
     
     shall be effective 7 days (in the case of a reduction in 
     rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase in rates) 
     after the date on which it is filed with the Commission 
     unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1) 
     before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is 
     appropriate.
     
Id. (emphasis added).

     The terms "legal" rate and "lawful" rate come to us bur-
dened with (or illuminated by) the Supreme Court's decision 
in Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe 
Railway Co., 284 U.S. 370 (1932), as the Commission recog-
nized in its Streamlined Tariff Order, 12 FCC Rcd at 2181-
82, p p 19-20 & nn.62, 65.  "Legality" mainly addresses proce-
dural validity.  "[T]o render rates definite and certain, and to 
prevent discrimination and other abuses," rates must be filed 
and published, and deviation from published rates is subject 
to criminal and civil penalties.  Arizona Grocery, 284 U.S. at 
384.  A particular rate thus becomes "legal" when it is filed 
with an agency and becomes effective.  But a rate's legality is 
not enough to establish its substantive reasonableness or 
"lawfulness."  See id. (noting that a rate's legality does not 
abrogate "the common-law duty to charge no more than a 
reasonable rate").  A carrier charging a merely legal rate 
may be subject to refund liability if customers can later show 
that the rate was unreasonable.  Id.  Should an agency 
declare a rate to be lawful, however, refunds are thereafter 
impermissible as a form of retroactive ratemaking.  See id. at 
387-89.

     Informed by this dichotomy, the Commission in its Stream-
lined Tariff Order interpreted the "deemed lawful" language 
in s 204(a)(3) as "establish[ing] a conclusive presumption of 
reasonableness."  Streamlined Tariff Order, 12 FCC Rcd at 
2181-82, p 19.  Therefore, "a streamlined tariff that takes 
effect without prior suspension or investigation is conclusively 
presumed to be reasonable and, thus, a lawful tariff during 
the period that the tariff remains in effect."  Id. at 2182, p 19.  
In accordance with Arizona Grocery, these "deemed lawful" 
tariffs are not subject to refunds.  If a later reexamination 

shows them to be unreasonable, the Commission's available 
remedies will be prospective only.  Id. at 2182-83, p p 20-21.  
As the Commission emphatically recognized, s 204(a)(3) ef-
fected a considerable change in the regulatory regime:  be-
fore, tariffs that became effective without suspension or inves-
tigation were only legal (not conclusively lawful), and thereby 
remained subject to refund remedies.  Id. at 2176, p 8 (de-
scribing no-refund rule as differing "radically" from past 
practice);  id. at 2182-82, p 20 (describing previous practice).

     Clearly then, to the extent that the streamlined tariff 
provisions apply to ACS tariff filings, the Commission may 
not now impose refund liability for covered rates--even ones 
it concludes were unreasonable.  The Commission, however, 
argues that the streamlined tariff provisions do not apply.

     First it asserts a critical distinction between rates and rates 
of return.  Order at 23, p 57.  It claims that since the Order 
found ACS in violation of its prescribed rate of return, the 
fact that ACS's rates might have been deemed lawful under 
s 204(a)(3) does not immunize it from refund liability.  In 
support, the Commission relies on New England Telephone 
and Telegraph Co. v. FCC, 826 F.2d 1101 (D.C. Cir. 1987), in 
which we upheld the Commission's use of a refund remedy for 
violations of prescribed rates of return.  Id. at 1109;  see also 
MCI Telecommunication Corp. v. FCC, 59 F.3d 1407, 1413 
(D.C. Cir. 1995).  Since neither s 204(a)(3) nor the Stream-
lined Tariff Order directly addressed the issue of rate-of-
return violations, the Commission contends that the "long-
standing rules concerning liability for rate-of-return viola-
tions" should be left unscathed.  Order at 25, p 59.

     The Commission's position, however, overlooks the lan-
guage of its statutory mandate.  Under the Communications 
Act of 1934, it is empowered to ensure just and reasonable 
rates ("charges"), not rates of return.  See 47 U.S.C. 
s 201(a).  The Commission acquires the authority to pre-
scribe rates of return only as a means to achieve just and 
reasonable rates.  See Nader v. FCC, 520 F.2d 182, 203 (D.C. 
Cir. 1975).  As we explained in Nader, rates of return are but 
one element in the task of ratemaking, but the Commission 

can prescribe them--sometimes in separate phases from the 
other necessary elements--if doing so will help the Commis-
sion "carry out its functions in an expeditious manner."  Id. 
at 204.  Over the years, rate-of-return violations have devel-
oped into proxies for finding rates unreasonable.  MCI, 59 
F.3d at 1414 (noting that the Commission may "treat a 
violation of [a rate-of-return] prescription as a per se violation 
of the requirement ... that a common carrier maintain 'just 
and reasonable' rates").  But we have never suggested that 
rates of returns could be ends in themselves, rather than 
means to the end of reasonable rates.

     Here, of course, no proxy for (un)reasonableness is needed.  
Since s 204(a)(3) deems ACS's rates to be lawful, the inquiry 
ends.  This situation is quite different from New England 
Telephone, which was decided before the passage of 
s 204(a)(3).  In that case, the carrier's rates had gone into 
effect with neither a Commission finding of reasonableness, 
826 F.2d at 1105, which under Arizona Grocery would bar 
refunds, nor a suspension of the rates and initiation of a 
hearing, for which s 204(a) (a precursor to the current 
s 204(a)(1)) specifically allowed refunds.  Section 204 as it 
then read was silent as to the permissibility of refunds where 
the Commission simply allowed the company's filed rate to go 
into effect without suspension or initiation of a hearing, and in 
effect New England Telephone read the silence as permitting 
the Commission to order refunds (in certain circumstances).  
For the cases covered by s 204(a)(3), Congress has now 
broken the silence.

     Recall that the Streamlined Tariff Order read s 204(a)(3)'s 
"deemed lawful" language to create a conclusive bar to re-
funds.  12 FCC Rcd at 2175-76, p p 8-9, 2181-82, p p 18-19.  
In doing so, it reasoned that "deemed lawful" was "unambigu-
ous" in the "consistent" interpretation of the courts.  Id. at 
2181-82, p 18;  see also, e.g., Ohio Power Co. v. FERC, 954 
F.2d 779, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussing "deemed" as estab-
lishing a conclusive presumption);  H.P. Coffee Co. v. Recon-
struction Finance Corp., 215 F.2d 818, 822 (Emer. Ct. App. 
1954) (reporting "almost unanimous judicial determination 
that the word ['deemed'], when employed in statutory law, 

creates a conclusive presumption").  This being so, and bear-
ing in mind that Commission control over the rate of return is 
under the statute merely a tool for determining the reason-
ableness of rates, see 47 U.S.C. s 201, we find s 204(a)(3) 
equally unambiguous in barring refunds purportedly for rate-
of-return violations.

     The Commission next suggests that s 204(a)(3) does not 
protect the January 1998 Tariff from refunds because neither 
of the two challenged cost allocation practices appeared in 
that filing.  Order at 23, p 56.  (Apparently, the earliest 
public disclosure was a March 1998 preliminary monitoring 
report, see Anchorage Telephone Utility, Rate of Return 
Report (Mar. 31, 1998);  Order at 5, p 9.)  Accordingly, the 
Commission contends that these " 'practices' were not 'filed' 
in [ACS's] January 1998 Tariff in accordance with section 
204(a)(3)."  Order at 23, p 56.  We find this argument some-
what mystifying.  By the Commission's own account, the 
methods used in the January 1998 Tariff were the proper 
ones.  Surely the Commission cannot now criticize ACS for 
failing to use in January 1998 the new accounting methods 
that the Commission maintains are impermissible and which 
ACS had not yet adopted.

     Alternatively, the Commission may be claiming that ACS's 
changes in computation, implemented between the January 
1998 Tariff and the July 1998 Tariff, were changes in "prac-
tices" within the meaning of s 204(a)(3) (authorizing filing of 
"a new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or prac-
tice"), so that ACS's failure to file a tariff announcing the 
computational change nullified any right of ACS to rely on 
the previously filed January 1998 Tariff.  But we see no basis 
for understanding s 204(a)(3)'s word "practice" to include 
internal computations underlying a rate.  The Streamlined 
Tariff Order expressly addresses filings that are hard to 
classify as rate reductions or rate increases (thus entailing 7- 
or 15-day waiting periods), and reads the 15-day language of 
s 204(a)(3) broadly as covering any non-rate change in "terms 
and conditions" or even introduction of new service;  yet it 
nowhere suggests that any of the words used by s 204(a)(3) 
encompasses purely internal changes in computation, as op-

posed to terms or conditions of service, which, like rate 
changes, are directly experienced by customers.  See 12 FCC 
Rcd at 2200-03, p p 62-68.

     The Commission may have been confused by its pre-
s 204(a)(3) habit of retroactively assessing the lawfulness of a 
rate long after it had taken effect without advance suspension 
or initiation of hearing.  See FCC Br. at 40.  As we noted in 
our 1995 MCI decision, it is virtually impossible to tell in 
advance just what rate of return a given rate may yield.  59 
F.3d at 1415-16.  In a world where the lawfulness of a rate is 
in almost endlessly suspended animation, the Commission 
may understandably feel entitled to receive ongoing updates 
of a company's calculations showing the links between its 
rates and its rate of return.  But that is not the world of 
s 204(a)(3), where the rate itself, if filed and not suspended, 
is "deemed lawful."

     We do not, of course, address the case of a carrier that 
furtively employs improper accounting techniques in a tariff 
filing, thereby concealing potential rate of return violations.  
The Order here makes no claim of such misconduct.

     Finally, the Commission argues that s 204(a)(3) does not 
protect the July 1998 Tariff because ACS failed to satisfy the 
statutory notice period.  Order at 23, p 54.  ACS filed the 
July 1998 Tariff on 7-days notice.  The Commission contends 
that because the Tariff changed accounting methods, it al-
tered "terms and conditions," and thus had to be filed on 15-
days notice.  Order at 25-26, p p 61-63;  see also Streamlined 
Tariff Order, 12 FCC Rcd at 2203, p 68 (discussing treatment 
of "tariffs that change terms and conditions or apply to new 
services even where there is no rate increase or decrease").  
Again, nothing in the statute or even the Streamlined Tariff 
Order supports the classification of a filing that changes only 
underlying calculations as an "increase in rate" requiring 15-
days notice.

     We note that since s 204(a)(3) immunizes ACS's rates for 
1998, it is unclear how its rate of return should be calculated 
for 1997 in light of Virgin Islands Telephone Corp. v. FCC, 
989 F.2d 1231 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  In Virgin Islands we held 

that the Commission could not evaluate a carrier's rate-of-
return using a period different from the two-year period the 
Commission had itself prescribed.  Id. at 1238 (holding inval-
id Commission use of a six-month monitoring period).  But 
there the truncation of the two-year period was at the insti-
gation of the Commission, while here it is a result of ACS's 
use of s 204(a)(3).  As the Commission has not yet had the 
opportunity to address rate of return violations for a period 
cut short in this fashion, we express no opinion and remand 
the case to the Commission for its consideration of the issue.

     Prejudgment Interest.  ACS lastly argues that the Com-
mission erred in using the IRS's rate for corporate overpay-
ment for the calculation of prejudgment interest.  ACS con-
tends that it should instead have used the rate for "large" 
corporate overpayments.  See Order at 29-30, p p 72-74.

     Under 26 U.S.C. s 6621, the IRS calculates five rates of 
interest, all functions of the Treasury's rate for short-term 
borrowing.  The rates depend on whether taxes are overpaid 
or underpaid, whether the party is an individual or a corpora-
tion, and whether the amount is "large" (exceeds $10,000).  
See 2002-12 I.R.B. 637, 638-43 (2002).  The Commission 
apparently co-opts these rates for the calculation of prejudg-
ment interest.  The following, for example, are the rates for 
January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999, the first period of pre-
judgment interest charged against ACS:

     Noncorporate over- and underpayment:  7%
     
     Corporate overpayment:  6%
     
     Large corporate overpayment:  4.5%
     
     Corporate underpayment:  7%
     
     Large corporate underpayment:  9%
     
Id.

     The Commission found that the rate for non-large corpo-
rate overpayments was most appropriate because it was "the 
overpayment rate that the Commission has most recently 

applied, despite the apparent availability of the rate for large 
corporate overpayments."  Order at 30, p 74.  The precedents 
offered by the Commission generally support this position.  
See In re Time Warner Entertainment/Advance-Newhouse 
Partnership, 14 FCC Rcd 9149, 9154 n.36 (1999);  In re 
Section 208 Complaints Alleging Violations of the Commis-
sion's Rate of Return Prescriptions, 12 FCC Rcd 4007, 4020-
21 app. B (1997).  The Ameritech case, in which the FCC 
held that the appropriate interest rate was the individual 
overpayment rate (as opposed to the corporate overpayment 
rate) is somewhat anomalous, but in any case offers no 
support for ACS's proposed use of the large corporate over-
payment rate.  See In re Long-Term Telephone Number 
Portability Tariff Filings of Ameritech Operating Compa-
nies, et al., 14 FCC Rcd 17,339, p p 1, 4 (1999).  Indeed, ACS 
presents no cases in which the Commission has ever applied 
the large corporate overpayment rate.  See Order at 30 
n.160.

     Fair enough.  But the Commission acknowledged the possi-
bility of applying the large corporate overpayment rate, in 
words contradicting its prior simple reasoning from prece-
dent:

     Although we might appropriately apply the rate for large 
     corporate overpayments exceeding $10,000 when a defen-
     dant has simply miscalculated revenue or demand and 
     accidently exceeded its rate of return, such is not the 
     case here.
     
Order at 30, p 74.  The Commission went on to justify the 
higher rate by arguing that ACS "had at least constructive 
knowledge" of the intrastate classification rule because "the 
Commission had rejected other carriers' attempts to assign 
ISP traffic to the interstate jurisdiction."  Id.  But those 
rejections happened in 1999, well after ACS filed its 1997 
tariffs.  See id. at 30 n.161 (cross-referencing id. at 9-10, 
p 21).  And while the rejections did occur before ACS filed its 
1997-98 Monitoring Report in September 1999, it is unclear 
why a company's acquisition of "constructive knowledge" of 

Commission views after its collection of disputed rates should 
affect its culpability for that collection.

     As the Commission alleges no bad faith (or quasi-bad faith) 
in the 1997 tariff filings, we fail to understand how this case 
differs from one in which "a defendant has simply miscalcu-
lated revenue or demand and accidently exceeded its rate of 
return."  Id. at 30, p 74.  We therefore remand the case for 
further explanation on this issue.

                             *  *  *

     We (1) deny ACS's petition for review of the Commission's 
classification of ISP-related traffic-sensitive costs as intra-
state, (2) grant its petition regarding the Commission's failure 
to honor s 204(a)(3)'s bar on refunds as to ACS's 1998 rates 
and vacate the Order insofar as it grants damages for over-
charges in 1998, and (3) remand the case to the Commission 
for (a) its consideration of the treatment of a rate-of-return 
violation for a monitoring period cut short by s 204(a)(3) 
filings, and (b) its reconsideration of the use of the IRS rate 
for non-large corporate overpayments for prejudgment inter-
est.

                                                            So ordered.
