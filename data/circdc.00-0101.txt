     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Henderson and Rogers, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Following the reversal of its convic-
tion under 18 U.S.C. s 201(c)(1)(A), Sun Growers of Califor-
nia ("Sun-Diamond")1 received a refund of the principal 
amount of the criminal fine that it had paid as part of its 
sentence, but its request for interest as of the date of 
payment was denied by the district court.  Sun-Diamond 
contends that the district court erred by depositing the 
original fine in a non-interest bearing account, and, therefore, 
Sun-Diamond is entitled to recover constructive interest on 
the principal amount of the fine.  The government responds 
that the criminal fine was required by statute to be deposited 
in the Crime Victims Fund, 42 U.S.C. s 10601(b)(1), a non-
interest bearing account, and that, even if the district court 
erred in its deposit of the fine, Sun-Diamond's claim for 
interest is barred by sovereign immunity.  Because Sun-
Diamond's contention that its criminal fine was required to be 
deposited in an interest-bearing account is meritless, we do 
not reach the contention that it was entitled to recover 
constructive interest and, accordingly, we affirm the order 
denying the payment of interest.

                                I.

     Sun-Diamond's sentence upon conviction of one count of 
unlawful gratuities, two counts of wire fraud, and five counts 
of illegal campaign contributions included a fine of 
$1,500,000.00, a special assessment of $1,225.00, and probation 
for five years. At the sentencing hearing, Sun-Diamond re-
quested that its sentence be stayed under Federal Rule 
Criminal Procedure 38(c) and (d) pending appeal, noting its 
cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, the distinc-
tion between an individual seeking bond pending appeal and

Diamond Growers of California.  Because the company's former 
name was used throughout the underlying litigation, we refer to 
appellant as Sun-Diamond.

an established corporation seeking to stay a fine, and the 
possibility of success on appeal.  The government opposed a 
stay of the fine, viewing likelihood of success on appeal to be 
"negligible" and noting the absence of hardship because the 
corporation already had advised its shareholders in its 1996 
Annual Report that money to pay the fine had been set aside.  
The district court denied the request to stay in part, ordering 
Sun-Diamond to "pay the fine within ten day[s], the full fine 
into the registry of the court."  The written judgment provid-
ed that "[t]his fine shall be paid to Registry of the court 
within 10 days."  Sun-Diamond paid the fine and special 
assessment, and the Clerk of the Court deposited this money 
in the Crime Victims Fund.

     Thereafter, this court reversed Sun-Diamond's gratuity 
conviction, finding that the district court applied an erroneous 
standard for conviction, and vacated the original sentence, 
holding that the district court erred in departing from the 
Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the fine.  See United 
States v. Sun-Diamond Growers, 138 F.3d 961, 964-69, 974-
77 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  The Supreme Court affirmed the rever-
sal of the gratuities conviction.  See United States v. Sun-
Diamond Growers, 526 U.S. 398, 405-11 (1999).  On remand, 
the district court vacated the original sentence and imposed a 
new sentence on the remaining counts of conviction, including 
a fine of $36,000.00 and a special assessment of $1,025.00.  
Sun-Diamond filed a motion for a refund of the difference 
between the two monetary sentences ($1,464,000.00 in fines 
and $200.00 for the special assessment), which, with interest, 
it calculated to be $1,666,610.49 in fines and $228.25 for the 
special assessment.

     The district court ordered a refund of the difference in the 
principal amount of the fine ($1,464,000.00) and assessment 
($200.00), but denied Sun-Diamond's request for interest.  
Rejecting Sun-Diamond's argument that Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 38(c) and U.S. District Court Local Rule 
67.1(b)(1) required the deposit of the original fine in an 
interest-bearing account, the district court ruled that the fine 
was correctly deposited in the Crime Victims Fund.  Noting 
that sovereign immunity bars an award of interest by the 

United States, the district court found no waiver of immunity 
and rejected the civil-forfeiture analogy and the constructive 
trust argument underlying Sun-Diamond's claim for an award 
of constructive interest.

                               II.

     Sun-Diamond's contention that it is entitled to interest on 
the original fine2 is two-fold.  It maintains first, that once the 
district court directed the criminal fine to be deposited to the 
Registry of the court, the fine was required to be deposited in 
an interest-bearing account pending appeal, and second, that 
because the district court erred in depositing the original fine 
into a non-interest bearing account, Sun-Diamond is entitled 
to recover "constructive interest" from the United States on 
the original fine as a result of its successful appeal.  We hold 
that the district court did not err in depositing the criminal 
fine in the Crime Victims Fund and thus do not reach Sun 
Diamond's constructive interest contention and the govern-
ment's sovereign immunity defense.

     In 1984, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Crime Con-
trol Act of 1984.  See Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 
1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, tit. II, 98 Stat. 1976 (1984).  Includ-
ed as part of that omnibus legislation was the Victims of 
Crime Act of 1984 ("Act"), see Victims of Crime Act of 1984, 
Pub. L. No. 98-473, tit. II, ch. XIV, 98 Stat. 2170 (codified as 
amended at 42 U.S.C. ss 10601-10604 and scattered sections 
of 18 U.S.C. (1994)), which established the Crime Victims 
Fund ("Fund").  See 42 U.S.C. s 10601(a) (1994).  The Fund, 
without fiscal year limitation, was established as a special 
account in the United States Treasury, and was designed to 
finance payments to state and federal victim compensation 
and assistance programs.  See id. ss 10601-10603;  United 

__________
     2 Sun-Diamond's request for interest involves both the criminal 
fine and the special assessment that it paid as part of the original 
sentence.  For simplicity, we refer only to the criminal fine;  Sun-
Diamond does not contend that a special assessment is legally 
distinct from a criminal fine for the purposes of this appeal.

States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 398 (1990).  The Act 
included various mechanisms to provide money to the Fund 
and set a cap on the Fund, with any excess in any year to be 
deposited in the general fund of the United States Treasury.  
See id. s 10601.

     The section of the Act establishing the Crime Victims Fund 
provides, with exceptions not applicable here, that "there 
shall be deposited in the Fund ... all fines that are collected 
from persons convicted of offenses against the United 
States."  Id. s 10601(b)(1) (emphasis added).  The provision 
does not make any exceptions for criminal fines that are 
being appealed.  The Administrative Office for United States 
Courts has developed criminal debt policies that direct the 
district court to deposit all criminal fines into the Fund.  See 
Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. I, ch. VII, pt. 
H, at 2.3.5 (Dec. 1999).  Therefore, the deposit of the original 
fine into the Crime Victims Fund was not only authorized by 
law, but was also mandated by s 10601(b)(1).3

     Sun-Diamond's contention that this reading of the Victims 
of Crime Act conflicts with the district court's own order, 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 38(c), D.C. District Court 
Local Rule 67.1(b)(1), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 67 
is groundless.  The district court's order that the criminal 
fine be paid to "the registry of the court" is consistent with 
the deposit of the fine, by way of the registry of the court, 

__________
     3 Such case law as has arisen regarding the Crime Victims Fund 
mainly involves Origination Clause challenges to the deposit of 
special assessments in the Fund, see, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 
901 F.2d 1000, 1003 (11th Cir. 1990);  United States v. Ashburn, 884 
F.2d 901, 903 (6th Cir. 1989), and Due Process Clause and Sentenc-
ing Guidelines challenges to the imposition of assessments to be 
deposited in the Fund for the costs of incarceration.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Sellers, 42 F.3d 116, 119 (2d Cir. 1994);  United 
States v. Spiropoulos, 976 F.2d 155, 166-67 (3d Cir. 1992).  Al-
though addressing issues unrelated to Sun-Diamond's contentions, 
none of the cases cast doubt that s 10601 requires the deposit in 
the Crime Victims Fund of criminal fines paid to the district court 
by federal defendants.  See Sellers, 42 F.3d at 119;  Spiropoulos, 
976 F.2d at 166-67.

into the Crime Victims Fund.4  The portion of Rule 38(c) that 
Sun-Diamond relies on, which provides that "[t]he court may 
require the defendant pending appeal to deposit ... the fine 
... into the registry of the district court," does not apply 
because the district court denied Sun-Diamond's motion to 
stay execution of the fine.5  Even if the Rule 38(c) procedure 
applies, depositing the fine "into the registry of the district 
court" is, again, consistent with the district court's deposit of 
the fine into the Crime Victims Fund.  Finally, Local Rule 
67.1 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 67 are inapplicable 
because they apply only to civil actions.6  Because Sun-
Diamond's claim for interest hinges upon its position that the 
district court erred in depositing the original fine in the 
__________
     4 Sun-Diamond's understanding that the phrase "registry of the 
court" is synonymous with the Court Registry Investment System 
("CRIS"), an interest bearing depository, is contrary to standard 
court practice to maintain a court registry that is separate and 
distinct from the CRIS.  See D.C. Dist. Ct. Local Rule 67.1(b)(1);  
Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. I, ch. VII, pt. I, at 
1.2 (Dec. 1999).

     5 Sun-Diamond elected not to appeal, and it cannot now ask the 
court to overturn that ruling.

     6 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 67 provides in relevant part:
     In an action in which any part of the relief sought is a 
     judgment for a sum of money ..., a party ... may deposit 
     with the court all or any part of such sum or thing....  The 
     fund shall be deposited in an interest-bearing instrument ap-
     proved by the court.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 47.  Local Rule 67.1 provides in relevant part:

          The following procedures shall govern deposits into the 
     registry of the Court in all civil actions.
               ...
               (b) Investment of Registry Funds
     
           (1) All funds deposited into the registry of the Court will 
     be placed in some sort of interest bearing account.  Unless 
     otherwise ordered, the Court Registry Investment System 
     (CRIS) ... shall be the investment mechanism authorized.

Crime Victims Fund, our holding to the contrary is disposi-
tive.

     Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court.
