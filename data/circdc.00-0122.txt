     Before:  Williams, Sentelle and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

      Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  Appellant Dennis L. Mitchell 
appeals from an order of the district court denying his motion 
for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. s 2255.  After 
deciding some previously unsettled procedural issues concern-
ing certificates of appealability ("COA") necessary to appeal 
the denial of s 2255 motions, we grant a COA as to appel-
lant's claim for per se ineffective assistance of counsel.  We 
deny his claim on the merits and affirm the order of the 
district court.

                          I. Background

     In 1993, Mitchell and a co-defendant were convicted of 
conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 
cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. ss 846, 
841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Mitchell was sen-
tenced to 324 months of incarceration.  We affirmed the 
convictions, but vacated Mitchell's sentence for consideration 
of a downward adjustment for his role in the offense.  See 
United States v. Mitchell, 49 F.3d 769 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  On 
remand, the district court resentenced Mitchell to 151 
months, and we affirmed in an unpublished order.  See 
United States v. Mitchell, 107 F.3d 923 (D.C. Cir. 1997) 
(table).

     On December 1, 1997, Mitchell filed a pro se motion for 
habeas corpus in the district court under 28 U.S.C. s 2255.  
He asserted two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel:  
(1) ineffective assistance because his attorney at trial, Profes-
sor James Robertson, did not locate and interview a Ms. 
Sonya Allen as a potential witness for trial who could have 
corroborated his defense, and (2) per se ineffective assistance 
of counsel because Robertson was suspended from the prac-

tice of the law in the District of Columbia during the repre-
sentation period.1

     The district court denied the motion.  Mitchell filed a 
notice of appeal without first seeking a certificate of appeala-
bility as required by 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1) (Supp. IV 1998).  
We appointed counsel for Mitchell, and directed the parties, 
while not otherwise limited, to address the following ques-
tions:  (1) whether a COA may be issued by this court in the 
first instance or instead must initially be sought from the 
district court;  and (2) whether appellant has "made a sub-
stantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right" re-
quired for the grant of a COA.

                 II. Certificate of Appealability

                          A. Who Decides

     The requirement that a defendant seek a COA to appeal 
the denial of a s 2255 petition stems from 28 U.S.C. 
s 2253(c)(1), which states in relevant part:

     Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of 
     appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of 
     appeals from ... the final order in a proceeding under 
     section 2255.
     
Rule 22(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 
prescribes the procedure for seeking a COA:

     (1) In a ... 28 U.S.C. s 2255 proceeding, the applicant 
     cannot take an appeal unless a circuit justice or a circuit 
     or district judge issues a certificate of appealability un-
     der 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c).  If an applicant files a notice of 
     appeal, the district judge who rendered the judgment 
     
__________
     1 Mitchell also claims that his equal protection rights were violat-
ed because federal statutes punish crack cocaine crime more severe-
ly than cocaine powder crimes.  This same argument was squarely 
rejected in United States v. Johnson, 40 F.3d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1994), 
and in Mitchell's direct appeal. See Mitchell, 49 F.3d at 781 n.5.  
Mitchell's citation of events which occurred after the governing 
statutes were enacted adds nothing.

     must either issue a certificate of appealability or state 
     why a certificate should not issue.  The district clerk 
     must send the certificate or statement to the court of 
     appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the 
     district-court proceedings.  If the district judge has de-
     nied the certificate, the applicant may request a circuit 
     judge to issue the certificate.
     
     (2) A request addressed to the court of appeals may be 
     considered by a circuit judge or judges, as the court 
     prescribes.  If no express request for a certificate is 
     filed, the notice of appeal constitutes a request addressed 
     to the judges of the court of appeals.
     
     As a threshold matter, 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1) does not 
clearly state that district court judges are empowered to issue 
COAs--it simply says "circuit justice or judge."  However, 
Rule 22(b) contemplates that "judge" means district judge, 
and all the circuits addressing the issue have held that 
district court judges have the power to issue COAs.  We join 
these circuits.  See Hunter v. United States, 101 F.3d 1565, 
1573-83 (11th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (containing a detailed 
discussion of the issue), overruled in part on other grounds 
by Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997);  see also Grant-
Chase v. Commissioner, New Hampshire Dep't of Correc-
tions, 145 F.3d 431, 435 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 941 
(1998);  Lozada v. United States, 107 F.3d 1011, 1015-17 (2d 
Cir. 1997), overruled on other grounds by United States v. 
Perez, 129 F.3d 255 (2d Cir. 1997);  United States v. Eyer, 113 
F.3d 470, 472-74 (3d Cir. 1997);  Else v. Johnson, 104 F.3d 82, 
82-83 (5th Cir. 1997);  Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 105 
F.3d 1063, 1073 (6th Cir. 1997), overruled in part on other 
grounds by Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997);  Tiedeman 
v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 522 (8th Cir. 1997);  United States v. 
Asrar, 116 F.3d 1268, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 1997);  United States 
v. Riddick, 104 F.3d 1239, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 1997), overruled 
on other grounds by United States v. Kunzman, 125 F.3d 
1363 (10th Cir. 1997).

     The parties are in accord that the language of Rule 22(b) 
contemplates that the district court should rule in the first 

instance on whether a COA should be issued, as other courts 
have held.  See, e.g., Lozada, 107 F.3d at 1016-17;  Kincade v. 
Sparkman, 117 F.3d 949, 953 (6th Cir. 1997).  We agree.  
The language of the Rule prescribes that upon the filing of 
the notice of appeal, the district court "must" decide the COA 
issue and the district court clerk "must" provide appropriate 
documentation to the court of appeals.  The Rule continues 
on to state that upon denial by the district court, a request 
may be made of a circuit judge.  We therefore hold that Rule 
22(b) requires initial application in the district court for a 
COA before the court of appeals acts on a COA request.

     Rule 22(b)(2) provides that when an appellant fails to file an 
express request for a COA with the court of appeals, the 
notice of appeal constitutes such a request to the judges of 
the court of appeals.  Normally, we will examine such re-
quests after the district court has ruled, see Edwards v. 
United States, 114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir. 1997), and we 
will generally transfer COA requests to the district court 
when the district court has not ruled.  However, any defect in 
procedure occasioned by the appellant's failure to make appli-
cation in this case is not jurisdictional, given the language of 
28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1), and Rule 22(b)(2).  Therefore, in view 
of the late stage in the proceedings at which we came to 
confront the question, we will proceed to consider whether to 
grant the COA ourselves.  Insofar as the failure of the 
appellant to make application to the district court creates any 
obstacle, we note that under Federal Rule of Appellate Proce-
dure 2, we have the authority to "suspend any provision of" 
the Rules of Appellate Procedure, including Rule 22(b)(1) 
except in limited instances not here relevant.  We therefore 
exercise that authority and proceed.

                     B. Merits of COA Request

     To determine whether Mitchell should receive a COA to 
pursue his appeal, we ask whether he "has made a substantial 
showing of the denial of a constitutional right."  28 U.S.C. 
s 2253(c)(2).  "[T]he petitioner need not show that he should 
prevail on the merits....  Rather, he must demonstrate that 

the issues are debatable among jurists of reason;  that a court 
could resolve the issues [in a different manner];  or that the 
questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed 
further." Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 893 n.4 (1983) 
(internal quotation marks omitted);  see also Byrd v. 
Henderson, 119 F.3d 34, 36 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding that 
Barefoot standard applies to COA requests).  Under this 
standard, we grant Mitchell's COA request on his claim of per 
se ineffective assistance of counsel.

     Normally, to make a successful ineffective assistance of 
counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant must 
show "(1) that counsel's performance was deficient, falling 
'below an objective standard of reasonableness,' and (2) that 
the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant, depriving 
him of a fair trial."  United States v. Bruce, 89 F.3d 886, 893 
(D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 
668, 688 (1984)).  Mitchell formulates two theories of ineffec-
tiveness.  The first is that Robertson's trial performance was 
deficient because he failed to produce Sonya Allen as a 
witness who would have, he claims, corroborated his defense.  
Certainly, as we observed in United States v. Debango, 780 
F.2d 81 (D.C. Cir. 1986), "[t]he complete failure to investigate 
potentially corroborating witnesses ... can hardly be consid-
ered a tactical decision."  Id. at 85.  But, as we further 
recalled in Debango, "[e]ven if counsel's performance fell 
below prevailing professional norms ... Strickland requires 
that a defendant establish prejudice."  Id.  The prejudice 
that Mitchell claims arose from the absence of Allen's testi-
mony, however, was plainly insufficient to satisfy the second 
prong of the Strickland test.2  To bypass this hurdle, Mitchell 

__________
     2 Allen would have testified that Mitchell was not present when 
Calvin Stevens, one of Mitchell's co-conspirators, retrieved a bag 
from the attic of the house he shared with Allen and removed a 
bundle of money from it.  Mitchell argues that because this evi-
dence partially contradicts Stevens's trial testimony and partially 
corroborates the contradictory testimony of another co-conspirator, 
Paul Campbell, it would have cast doubt on his knowledge of illegal 
activity and participation in the conspiracy.  But as the district 
court pointed out Ms. Allen's testimony was cumulative, and other 

invokes the rule that prejudice can be presumed "if a defen-
dant can show that 'a conflict of interest actually affected the 
adequacy of [the attorney's] representation....' "  Bruce, 89 
F.3d at 893 (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 349 
(1980)).  Claiming that Robertson was suspended from the 
practice of law in the District of Columbia during Mitchell's 
trial, appellant argues that Robertson had a conflict of inter-
est because he was preoccupied with his own disciplinary 
proceedings and fear of sanctions and wanted to keep his 
status concealed, so he did not expend extra funds reimbursa-
ble under the Criminal Justice Act as appointed counsel to 
seek out Ms. Allen.

     The district court did not resolve the issue of Robertson's 
bar status.  The court noted that Robertson was in fact 
admitted to practice before the district court during the 
relevant period, but accepted the proposition that this admis-
sion may have been under questionable circumstances.  The 
district court thus assumed for the sake of argument that 
Robertson was suspended.  In any event, the suspension was 
not in any way related to Robertson's conduct in representing 
Mitchell.

     Even if we also assume that Robertson was suspended, 
Mitchell's conflict of interest scenario is simply too hypotheti-
cal to gain him relief.  There is no evidence that Robertson 
would have needed extraordinary funds to find Allen or that 
such expenditures would somehow trigger a review of his bar 
qualifications.  We have been careful to guard against "defen-
dants' attempts to force their ineffective assistance claims 
into the 'actual conflict of interest' framework ... and there-
by supplant the strict Strickland standard with the far more 
lenient Cuyler test."  Bruce, 89 F.3d at 893;  see also United 
States v. Taylor, 139 F.3d 924, 930-32 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  
Mitchell's conflict theory is such an attempt.  See United 
States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 916-17 (5th Cir. 
1998) ("[A]n undisclosed lack of credentials ... provide[s] an 
incentive for lackluster representation, the theory goes, be-

__________
evidence in the form of a taped conversation between two of the co-
conspirators casts serious doubt on Mitchell's theory.

cause the attorney will be concerned about drawing attention 
to himself and encouraging an inquiry into his background."), 
cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1107 (1999).  We could as easily say 
that far from having a conflict of interest, Robertson had "an 
incentive to do his best" to avoid a later ineffective assistance 
claim and the exposure of his status.  United States v. 
Leggett, 81 F.3d 220, 226-27 (D.C. Cir. 1996);  see also Vance 
v. Lehman, 64 F.3d 119, 126 (3d Cir. 1995).  We conclude that 
Mitchell's ineffectiveness claim on these grounds does not rise 
to the level of a substantial showing of the denial of a 
constitutional right.

     Mitchell's second argument in support of his ineffective 
assistance of counsel claim has slightly more promise.  Based 
on a different line of precedent, he contends that Robertson's 
suspension calls for a finding of per se ineffectiveness.  In 
Harrison v. United States, 387 F.2d 203 (D.C. Cir. 1967), 
rev'd on other grounds, 392 U.S. 219 (1968), where an ex-
convict posed as an attorney, we held that the requirements 
of the Sixth Amendment "are not satisfied when the accused 
is 'represented' by a layman masquerading as a qualified 
attorney."  Id. at 212.  Mitchell candidly admits that other 
courts have rejected a per se ineffectiveness rule for attor-
neys who have been licensed to practice law and later subject-
ed to discipline such as suspension, but claims that Harrison 
could support such a rule in an issue of "first impression" in 
this circuit.  In his view, a generous reading could extend 
Harrison and hold that a suspended attorney is not a "quali-
fied attorney" because he is not currently "admitted to the 
practice of the law, no matter how intelligent or well educated 
he may be."  Id.

     It appears that most courts facing the issue have held that 
suspension or disbarment alone is not enough to make an 
attorney per se ineffective.  See, e.g., Reese v. Peters, 926 
F.2d 668, 670 (7th Cir. 1991);  Waterhouse v. Rodriguez, 848 
F.2d 375, 383 (2d Cir. 1988);  United States v. Mouzin, 785 
F.2d 682, 696-97 (9th Cir. 1986);  United States v. Myles, 10 
F. Supp. 2d 31, 36 (D.D.C. 1998);  see generally Jay M. Zitter, 
Annotation, Criminal Defendant's Representation by Person 
Not Licensed to Practice Law as Violation of Right to 

Counsel, 19 A.L.R. 5th 351 (1994).  However, a few jurists 
appear to have thought otherwise.  See In re Johnson, 822 
P.2d 1317, 1323-24 (Cal. 1992) (applying California Constitu-
tion);  Ohio v. Newcombe, 577 N.E.2d 125, 126 (Ohio Ct. App. 
1989);  Mouzin, 785 F.2d at 703-04 (Ferguson, J., dissenting).  
To more clearly define the contours of the issue in this circuit, 
we grant a COA on Harrison's claim of per se ineffective 
assistance of counsel.

                         III. Per Se Rule

     We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se 
ineffectiveness rule beyond cases in which a defendant is 
represented by a person never properly admitted to any bar.  
See, e.g., Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 168-69 (2d 
Cir. 1983);  United States v. Novak, 903 F.2d 883, 886-90 (2d 
Cir. 1990).  In fact, we earlier intimated such a limitation in 
United States v. Butler, 504 F.2d 220 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  
There, appellant's trial counsel had not been admitted to the 
local bar, and we stated that "[s]tanding alone, the mere fact 
of a trial attorney's nonmembership in the local bar is not 
necessarily sufficient to find that the right to effective counsel 
was breached."  Id. at 223.  Instead, we found counsel inef-
fective in Butler only because in addition to the lack of bar 
membership, there were numerous instances of attorney er-
ror at trial.  See id. at 224.

     We hold that the fact of suspension does not, by itself, 
render counsel ineffective under the Sixth Amendment.  In-
stead, the normal Strickland rule applies and a defendant 
must meet his burden of showing deficient performance at 
trial which resulted in prejudice.  See Mouzin, 785 F.2d at 
696-97.  As the Ninth Circuit said in Mouzin:

     Neither suspension nor disbarment invites a per se rule 
     that continued representation in an ongoing trial is con-
     stitutionally ineffective.  Admission to the bar allows us 
     to assume that counsel has the training, knowledge, and 
     ability to represent a client who has chosen him.  Contin-
     
     ued licensure normally gives a reliable signal to the 
     public that the licensee is what he purports to a be--an 
     attorney qualified to advise and represent a client.
     
Id. at 698.

     As time passes, some admitted members of the bar incur 
sanctions of suspension or disbarment which leave them no 
longer entitled to lawfully practice the profession.  As the 
Ninth Circuit noted, sometimes this "discipline flows from 
revealed incompetence or untrustworthiness or turpitude 
such as to deserve no client's confidence."  Id.  Sometimes, 
however, the grounds of suspension are sufficiently unrelated 
to the previously prevailing presumption of competence that 
no inference can be drawn of ineffectiveness in representa-
tion.  Therefore, there is no logical reason to extend the per 
se ineffectiveness rule beyond those instances already covered 
in the Harrison presumption--when a defendant is repre-
sented by a person never properly admitted to the practice of 
law.  Therefore, our examination in a case such as this 
involving a suspended attorney is governed by Strickland v. 
Washington, and requires the showing of incompetence and 
prejudice that Mitchell has not made.3

     Other circuits addressing the issue have reached similar 
results.  Instead of extending a per se rule to cover various 
states of attorney licensure, courts have considered the facts 
of the cases to determine if counsel was ineffective.  See 
Waterhouse, 848 F.2d at 383;  Vance, 64 F.3d at 122-26;  
Roach v. Martin, 757 F.2d 1463, 1479-80 (4th Cir. 1985);  
Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d at 916-19;  Reese, 926 F.2d at 669-
70;  United States v. Hoffman, 733 F.2d 596, 599-601 (9th Cir. 
1984);  United States v. Stevens, 978 F.2d 565, 568-69 (10th 
Cir. 1992).  Therefore, although appellant's per se ineffective 
assistance claim survives the hurdle of the certificate of 
appealability, it merits no relief.

son's disciplinary difficulties is recounted in United States v. Myles,

                          IV. Conclusion

     In summary, we hold that the district court has the power 
to issue certificates of appealability and is required to consid-
er and make a decision on the COA issue before the court of 
appeals will address it.  We further hold that although appel-
lant was entitled to a COA on his claim of per se ineffective 
assistance of counsel, his claim fails on the merits.  To the 
extent we exercise jurisdiction to review the order of the 
district court, it is

                                                                                                Affirmed.
