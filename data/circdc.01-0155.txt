                     United States of America

                                v.

                          Jose Naranjo, 
                            Appellant

          Appeal from the United States District Court 
                  for the District of Columbia 
                           93cr00418-01

                            ---------

                    On Appellant's Petition for Rehearing

                            ---------

     Before:  Sentelle, Henderson, and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Per Curiam:  After this Court denied Jose Naranjo's ("the 
Defendant") appeal from the district court's denial of his 
collateral review motion, he moved for rehearing or alterna-
tively to amend his motion to include a new claim.  In this 
motion, for the first time the Defendant claims that his 
sentence should be vacated following the Supreme Court's 
decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).  

Because both the district court and this Court already have 
denied the Defendant's collateral review motion based on the 
claims he raised originally, and because he does not offer any 
reason sufficient for us to reconsider our earlier denial, we 
deny his motion for rehearing.  In addition, we deny his 
motion to add a new claim based on Apprendi.

                          I. BACKGROUND

     In 1995, the Defendant was convicted for drug conspiracy 
in violation of 21 U.S.C. ss 841(a)(1) and 846.  He was 
sentenced to life in prison after the district court judge found 
that he was responsible for five or more kilograms of cocaine.  
On direct appeal, we affirmed his conviction and sentence.  
See United States v. Gaviria, 116 F.3d 1498, 1530-35 (D.C. 
Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1982 (1998).

     In 1999, the Defendant filed a pro se motion for habeas 
corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. s 2255, asserting five claims for 
relief.  The district court denied the Defendant's motion and 
subsequently denied his request for a certificate of appealabil-
ity.  The Defendant then petitioned this Court for a certifi-
cate of appealability.  In August 2000, we denied his petition 
and dismissed his appeal.  The Defendant then filed a "Mo-
tion for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc 
and Motion for Leave to Supplement/Amend Motion to Va-
cate" in light of Apprendi.  In this filing, the Defendant 
argues for the first time that his sentence should be vacated 
under Apprendi.  We ordered the Government to respond to 
this motion and appointed amicus curiae to file a reply brief 
on behalf of the Defendant.

                           II. ANALYSIS

     In his motion, the Defendant seeks to assert issues on 
rehearing that were not raised before the district court 
originally or before us initially on appeal.  Amicus curiae 
argues that the Defendant's motion to amend should be 
granted (or at least remanded to the district court to consider 
granting it) under the "long-odds exception" to the general 
rule barring amendments to pleadings on appeal.  See Dart-

mouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 
1989).  Under the long-odds exception recognized by the 
First Circuit, a court will grant leave to amend if "justice ... 
requires further proceedings."  Id. (internal quotation omit-
ted).  Amicus curiae claims that justice requires permitting 
the amendment in this case because, among other reasons:  
(1) the Defendant in no way acted in bad faith by not raising 
the Apprendi issue earlier;  (2) he would have been allowed to 
amend his motion in district court under Federal Rule of 
Procedure 15(a);  and (3) "courts freely grant pro se litigants 
leave to amend," Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 
548 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  If the amendment is permitted, amicus 
curiae avers that it will relate back to the time of the 
Defendant's original s 2255 motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 
15(c)(2), and therefore meet s 2255's statute of limitation 
requirements, see s 2255 p 6(1).

     By raising certain claims "before the court which imposed 
the sentence," 28 U.S.C. s 2255 p 1, the Defendant has 
waived his statutory right under s 2255 to assert other claims 
on appeal as part of his initial motion for collateral review.  
Cf. Abdullah v. United States, 240 F.3d 683, 685 (8th Cir. 
2001) ("Generally, a habeas claim cannot be raised by a 
petitioner for the first time on appeal.").  We already have 
denied the Defendant's s 2255 motion once, and he has not 
articulated why the issues initially raised in that motion 
justify rehearing by the panel or by the Court en banc.  See 
D.C. Cir. R. 35;  Fed. R. App. P. 35, 40.

     This Court has a well-established rule against allowing 
parties to initiate new claims on appeal and has never 
adopted the long-odds exception.  See Shipbuilders Council 
of Am. v. United States, 868 F.2d 452, 456 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 
1989).  We have, however, cited the First Circuit's decision in 
Dartmouth Review to note that our approach to parties' 
attempts to amend their pleadings on appeal "need not be 
inflexible."  Guam v. Am. President Lines, 28 F.3d 142, 151 
& n.18 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Still, in that case, as in other cases, 
we denied the party's attempt to add a new claim on appeal.  
See id. at 151;  see also Independent Petroleum Ass'n of Am. 

v. Babbitt, 235 F.3d 588, 597 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  Shipbuilders 
Council, 868 F.2d at 456 n.2.

     If we permit the Defendant to raise his Apprendi claim in 
his motion for rehearing, we would be allowing him not only 
to undermine this well-established rule, but also to end-run 
the strict requirements for seeking collateral review under 
s 2255.  Congress specifically limited prisoners to one collat-
eral review motion as of right.  See s 2255 p 8.  For this 
reason, prisoners are on notice to "choose their issues wisely."  
Talbott v. Indiana, 226 F.3d 866, 869 (7th Cir. 2000).  Indeed, 
the Seventh Circuit has warned prisoners that "the itch to 
invoke the latest decision of the Supreme Court can be costly, 
because a loss will require [the appellate] court's approval to 
launch a later collateral attack if better grounds for relief 
become available."  Id.  The district court already "has de-
nied [the Defendant] relief" on the claims raised in his initial 
motion for collateral review.  See s 2255 p 5.  Allowing him 
(or similarly situated prisoners) to add new claims to a motion 
that already has been dismissed by the district court (and 
dismissed on appeal) would effectively give him two bites at 
the same apple and would substantially erode the limits 
Congress established on prisoners' ability to seek collateral 
review.  Accordingly, we deny the Defendant's request to 
amend his motion for collateral review.

                         III. CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's motion for 
rehearing and motion to amend his s 2255 motion are denied.
