     Before:  Sentelle and Rogers, Circuit Judges, and 
Williams, Senior Circuit Judge.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Barr Laboratories, Inc. ("Barr") 
appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment, 
interpreting the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. ss 301 et seq., and 
regulations promulgated thereunder, 21 C.F.R. ss 314.94, 
314.107, to Pharmachemie, B.V., a potential competitor of 
Barr's.  Barr contends that the district court erred in vacat-
ing an administrative ruling of the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration ("FDA") that Barr, as the first company to file a 
paragraph IV certification for tamoxifen, a breast cancer 
drug, as part of its application for FDA review and approval 
of its generic version of tamoxifen, had a statutory right to 
180 days of generic exclusivity.  After the district court 
granted summary judgment, Pharmachemie lost its court 
challenge to the underlying patent of the pioneer drug manu-
facturer's tamoxifen.  As a result, Pharmachemie cannot mar-
ket its generic version of tamoxifen until the patent expires.  
Because the FDA's ruling no longer causes any redressible 
harm to Pharmachemie, we conclude that the case is moot 
and, accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdic-
tion, vacate the judgment of the district court, and remand 
the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the 
complaint.

                                I.

     The Hatch-Waxman Amendments simplified the procedure 
for obtaining approval of generic drugs.  See Pub. L. No. 
98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984).  While a pioneer drug manufac-
turer must file a New Drug Application with safety and 
effectiveness data, subsequent applicants who want to manu-
facture generic versions of the original drug need only file an 
Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"), which relies 
on the FDA's previous determination that the drug is safe 

and effective.  See 21 U.S.C. ss 355(a), (j).  As relevant here, 
the Hatch-Waxman Amendments establish an ANDA certifi-
cation process that enables generic drug manufacturers to 
obtain expedited approval of their ANDAs before expiration 
of the pioneer's patent.  See id. ss 355(j)(2)(A)(vii), (5)(b).  
The ANDA must include a paragraph certification that (I) no 
patent information has been filed, (II) the patent has expired, 
(III) the patent will expire on a date certain, or (IV) the 
patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which 
the applicant seeks approval.  See id. s 355(j)(2)(A)(vii).  Rel-
evant here is the paragraph IV certification, which triggers a 
complex process that potentially allows the ANDA applicant 
to market its generic drug before the pioneer's patent ex-
pires.  See id. s 355(j)(5)(b).  The FDA can approve a para-
graph IV certification ANDA immediately unless the patent 
holder files suit within forty-five days of receiving notice of 
the paragraph IV certification.  See id. s 355(j)(5)(B)(iii);  21 
C.F.R. s 314.107(f)(2).  If a patent infringement action is 
timely brought, the ANDA can be approved only upon the 
expiration of a thirty-month period, unless this period is 
altered by the court or a decision of that court.  See 21 U.S.C. 
s 355(j)(5)(B)(iii).  As an incentive to the first generic maker 
to risk costly patent litigation by filing an ANDA with a 
paragraph IV certification, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
provide that the first to file a paragraph IV certification for a 
particular drug is eligible for a 180-day period of marketing 
protection (i.e., exclusivity from competition from subsequent 
generic drug manufacturers), beginning from the earlier of 
the first filer's commercial marketing of the drug or a deci-
sion of a court holding the patent invalid or not infringed.  
See id. s 355(j)(5)(B)(iv).

     In 1985, Barr submitted an ANDA containing a paragraph 
III certification for the drug tamoxifen, which was patented 
by Imperial Chemical Industries, PLC ("Imperial") under 
U.S. Patent No. 4,536,516 (" '516 patent"), which is due to 
expire on August 20, 2002.  Barr amended its ANDA in 1987 
to a paragraph IV certification, making it the first company to 
file an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for tamoxifen.  
Imperial sued Barr for patent infringement, triggering the 

thirty-month statutory stay.  In 1992, a district court ruled in 
favor of Barr.  Imperial Chem. Indus., PLC v. Barr Labs., 
795 F. Supp. 619 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), appeal dismissed and 
vacated pursuant to settlement sub nom. Imperial Chem. 
Indus., PLC v. Heumann Pharma GmbH & Co., 991 F.2d 
811, No. 92-1403, 1993 WL 118931 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 19, 1993) 
(Table).  While Imperial's appeal to the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was pending, Imperial and 
Barr entered into a settlement agreement, in which Imperial 
licensed Barr to sell its tamoxifen product and Barr agreed 
not to pursue efforts to obtain final approval of its ANDA 
prior to the expiration of the '516 patent.  As a result of the 
settlement, on March 19, 1993, the Federal Circuit dismissed 
Imperial's appeal and vacated the district court's judgment.  
Imperial Chem. Indus., PLC v. Heumann Pharma GmbH & 
Co., 991 F.2d 811, No. 92-1403, 1993 WL 118931 (Fed. Cir. 
Mar. 19, 1993) (Table).  Barr subsequently amended its 
ANDA from a paragraph IV certification to a paragraph III 
certification, delaying approval of its ANDA until the expira-
tion of the '516 patent.

     In 1996, Pharmachemie filed its own ANDA for tamoxifen 
with a paragraph IV certification, amending its 1994 para-
graph III certification ANDA.  Zeneca Limited ("Zeneca"), 
which obtained the patent rights of the '516 patent from 
Imperial, its former parent company, filed a paragraph IV 
patent infringement suit against Pharmachemie, triggering 
the thirty-month statutory stay.  Zeneca Ltd. v. Pharmache-
mie B.V. (No. 96-12413).  On April 3, 1997, the FDA tenta-
tively approved Pharmachemie's ANDA, to be effective at the 
earlier of the expiration of the statutory thirty-month stay 
period (or the period set forth by the court), the date of a 
final court decision, or the date of the expiration of the 
patent.  On March 2, 1999, the FDA granted Barr's June 26, 
1998 petition, which was filed shortly before the thirty-month 
statutory stay of Pharmachemie's ANDA was to expire and 
which sought enforcement of Barr's 180-day exclusivity peri-
od.  The FDA imposed a stay on approval of all other 
ANDAs for tamoxifen until 180 days after the date of Barr's 
first commercial marketing of the drug or the date of a final 

decision of a court holding the '516 patent invalid or not 
infringed.

     Pharmachemie then sought injunctive and declaratory re-
lief in the district court, challenging the FDA's March 2, 1999 
decision as contrary to the statute and FDA regulations.  
Barr intervened.  On March 31, 2000, the district court (after 
consolidating the case with a similar suit brought by Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) granted summary judgment to Phar-
machemie.  Mylan Pharm. Inc. v. Henney, 94 F. Supp. 2d 36 
(D.D.C. 2000).

     Thereafter, two relevant events occurred.  First, the FDA 
did not appeal the district court's decision, but rather, on July 
13, 2000, issued an interim rule amending its regulations that 
interpreted the meaning of "court decision," 21 C.F.R. 
ss 314.107(e)(1)-(2)(iii), on which it had relied in granting 
Barr's petition.  Court Decisions, ANDA Approvals, and 
180-Day Exclusivity, 65 Fed. Reg. 43,233, 43,233 (2000).  In 
view of recent judicial decisions, the FDA defined a "decision 
of a court" to include a district court opinion regardless of 
whether that opinion is appealed.  Id. at 43,234.  This rule is 
prospective only.  FDA, Guidance for Industry, Court Deci-
sions, ANDA Approvals, and 180-Day Exclusivity Under the 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act 4 (2000).  Second, Pharmachemie lost its 
patent suit against Zeneca, and the district court in that case 
ordered that Pharmachemie's ANDA would become effective 
no earlier than the expiration of the '516 patent.  Zeneca Ltd. 
v. Pharmachemie, B.V., Order (Oct. 27, 2000).

                               II.

     Pharmachemie contends that the case is moot on appeal 
because it can no longer obtain the relief it sought in its 
complaint in light of the adverse final judgment on the 
validity of the patent.  Barr responds that the appeal is not 
moot because the district court's decision stripping Barr of its 
statutory right to generic exclusivity continues to harm Barr.  
Alternatively, pointing to Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. v. 
FDA, No. 99-5287, 2000 WL 1838303, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 

15, 2000), Barr contends that the issues on appeal are capable 
of repetition, yet evade review because there are only 180 
days in which to obtain judicial review of challenges to the 
statutory exclusivity period.

     The mootness doctrine limits Article III courts to deciding 
"actual, ongoing controversies."  Clarke v. United States, 915 
F.2d 699, 700-01 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (quoting Honig v. Doe, 484 
U.S. 305, 317 (1988)).  A case is moot if "events have so 
transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the 
parties' rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of 
affecting them in the future."  Id. at 701 (quoting Transwest-
ern Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 897 F.2d 570, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1990));  
accord Pub. Util. Comm'n of the St. of Cal. v. FERC, 236 
F.3d 708, 714 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Thus, "Article III denies 
federal courts the power to decide questions that cannot 
affect the rights of litigants in the case before them, and 
confines them to resolving real and substantial controvers[ies] 
admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive 
character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the 
law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts."  Lewis v. 
Cont'l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990) (quoting N.C. v. 
Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).

     The district court in Zeneca Ltd. ruled in favor of the 
patent holder Zeneca, rejecting Pharmachemie's challenges to 
the '516 patent and ordering that the effective date of Phar-
machemie's ANDA be no earlier than the expiration of the 
'516 patent.  Pharmachemie did not appeal, and the judgment 
upholding the patent became final.  Pharmachemie also 
amended its ANDA, changing the patent certification from 
paragraph IV to III, delaying approval of its ANDA until the 
expiration of the '516 patent.  In view of the final judgment 
upholding the '516 patent, Pharmachemie no longer suffers a 
redressible harm in this case.  Whether it wins or loses on 
appeal, it will be prevented from marketing its generic drug 
before the patent expires--thus, making the case moot on 
appeal.  Cf. In re Highway Truck Drivers & Helpers Local 
Union #107, 888 F.2d 293, 297-98 (3d Cir. 1989);  In re 
Cantwell, 639 F.2d 1050, 1054 (3d Cir. 1981).  To the extent 
Pharmachemie's failure to appeal the judgment upholding the 

'516 patent constitutes voluntary action bringing about moot-
ness, "a court may conclude that voluntary cessation has 
rendered a case moot if the party urging mootness demon-
strates that (1) 'there is no reasonable expectation that the 
alleged violation will recur,' and (2) 'interim relief or events 
have completely or irrevocably eradicated the effects of the 
alleged violations.' "  Nat'l Black Police Ass'n v. D.C., 108 
F.3d 346, 349 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting County of Los Angeles 
v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)).  Pharmachemie meets this 
test because it is precluded from further challenging Barr's 
180-day exclusivity period by the judgment upholding the '516 
patent;  again, Pharmachemie no longer suffers a redressible 
harm in this case, and Pharmachemie would have no standing 
to make a future challenge.  See Lujan v. Defenders of 
Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).

     Barr's contentions that the case is not moot on appeal are 
unpersuasive.  First, as between Pharmachemie and Barr, 
the value of Barr's exclusivity has no potential of being 
harmed because Pharmachemie is precluded from marketing 
tamoxifen before the expiration of the '516 patent.  Contrary 
to Barr's suggestion, the instant appeal does not present the 
issue whether the 180-day exclusivity period extends beyond 
the expiration of the patent.  This issue was neither ad-
dressed in the FDA's decision nor raised in Pharmachemie's 
complaint in the district court.  The issue in the instant 
appeal as to the trigger of the 180-day exclusivity period is 
limited to whether any court decision is sufficient to trigger 
s 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)'s court-decision trigger.  The court is 
therefore not called upon to decide whether the exclusivity 
period extends beyond the expiration of the patent.  In 
addition, the risk that other drug manufacturers might in-
trude upon the value of Barr's 180-day exclusivity as to 
tamoxifen is unrelated to the present controversy, and to rule 
here, in an effort to avoid that risk is precisely the type of 
advisory decision-making that Article III courts are constitu-
tionally required to avoid.

     Second, fatal to most of Barr's contentions, including that 
the district court decision guts its marketing strategy of 
challenging suspect drug patents under the Hatch-Waxman 

Amendments, is the fact that an adverse decision in the 
district court is insufficient to create a case or controversy on 
appeal.  City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000), on 
which Barr relies, is distinguishable;  in that case, the case 
was not moot, in part, because of the harm to the losing party 
that would result from the unvacated decision below, which 
the Supreme Court could not vacate due to federalism con-
cerns.  Id. at 288;  see also id. at 305 (Scalia, J., concurring in 
the judgment).  There is no similar risk here because the 
appropriate procedure upon concluding that this case is moot 
is to vacate the district court decision.  United States v. 
Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 & n.2 (1950);  Columbian 
Rope Co. v. West, 142 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 & n.5 (D.C. Cir. 
1998).  Vacatur of the district court decision will have no 
future adverse effect on Barr's marketing strategy.  More-
over, to conclude that the instant case is not moot solely 
because of the district court's adverse judgment would create 
a case or controversy with only one interested party.  City of 
Erie, 529 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment).  
Any implication that the court should now rule on Barr's 
contentions on the merits because of the possibility that an 
adverse decision in the district court will remain is, again, a 
request for an advisory opinion as to other potential cases, 
with no effect on the present parties.

     Finally, Barr's contention that the issues raised are capable 
of repetition, yet evading review fails to recognize the limits 
of this exception to the mootness doctrine.  The Supreme 
Court set forth the familiar test for the "capable of repetition, 
yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine in 
Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147 (1975):

     [I]n the absence of a class action, the "capable of repeti-
     tion, yet evading review" doctrine [is] limited to the 
     situation where two elements combine[]:  (1) the chal-
     lenged action was in its duration too short to be fully 
     litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there 
     was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining 
     party would be subjected to the same action again.
     
Id. at 149.  Barr has failed to demonstrate that the present 
issues satisfy both prongs of this narrow exception.  See City 
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983).

     Under the evading review prong, the question is whether 
"the challenged activity is by its very nature short in dura-
tion, so that it could not, or probably would not, be able to be 
adjudicated while fully live."  LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F.3d 
974, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Conyers v. Reagan, 765 
F.2d 1124, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 1985)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  Barr contends that judicial review is limited by the 
duration of the 180-day exclusivity period.  Yet it is not the 
180-day limit on exclusivity that has mooted the instant case, 
but rather the outcome of Pharmachemie's patent suit.  The 
court need not resolve whether this intervening cause of 
mootness makes irrelevant Barr's contentions that the 
180-day period inherently evades review, however, because 
Barr must still meet the second prong for this exception to 
apply, and it cannot.

     Under the capable of repetition prong, there must be a 
"reasonable expectation that the same complaining party 
would be subjected to the same action again."  Weinstein, 
423 U.S. at 149 (emphasis added);  see also Liu v. INS, No. 
00-5345, 2001 WL 1657298 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 28, 2001).  This 
prong requires that the same parties will engage in litigation 
over the same issues in the future.  Norman v. Reed, 502 
U.S. 279, 288 (1992);  Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of 
Maint. of Way Employes, 481 U.S. 429, 436 n.4 (1987);  Cruz 
v. Farquharson, 252 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 2001);  Columbian 
Rope, 142 F.3d at 1317;  Meyers v. Jay St. Connecting R.R., 
288 F.2d 356, 359 (2d Cir. 1961).  As the Second, Seventh, 
and Ninth Circuits have explicitly held, relying on constitu-
tional grounds, "there must be a reasonable degree of likeli-
hood that th[e] issue will be the basis of a continuing contro-
versy between these two parties" in "order to ensure the 
existence of an ongoing controversy."  Cent. Soya Co. v. 
Consol. Rail Corp., 614 F.2d 684, 689 (7th Cir. 1980);  accord 
Video Tutorial Servs., Inc. v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 79 F.3d 
3, 6 (2d Cir. 1996);  Lee v. Schmidt-Wenzel, 766 F.2d 1387, 

1390 (9th Cir. 1985) (quoting 13 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. 
Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure s 3533, at 291-92 
(1975)).

     Unlike Teva, the FDA is no longer a party in the instant 
case;  the only parties on appeal are Barr and Pharmachemie.  
For this case to be grounded in a live case or controversy, the 
only question is what is the likelihood that Barr and Pharma-
chemie will engage in this same litigation.  Barr has not 
contended that it and Pharmachemie are frequent rival liti-
gants.  But assuming that Barr and Pharmachemie may 
again be rival ANDA applicants, several contingencies would 
have to occur for the same issues to arise again:  (1) Barr 
must be the first to have filed an ANDA for a particular drug 
with a paragraph IV certification;  (2) Pharmachemie must 
later file an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for the 
same drug;  and (3) there must be some basis for a dispute as 
to the exclusivity period because, for example, Barr wins a 
judgment invalidating the patent and the judgment is vacat-
ed, or Pharmachemie is able to market its generic version 
while an appeal of Barr's judgment invalidating the patent is 
pending, or Barr voluntarily converts its paragraph IV certifi-
cation to a paragraph III certification.  While the combina-
tion of all of these contingencies is possible, Barr has not 
demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that they will occur.  
See James v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 824 F.2d 
1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 1987);  Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d 462, 
466-67 (D.C. Cir. 1986).

     Because the issues are moot on appeal, vacatur of the 
district court decision granting summary judgment to Phar-
machemie is appropriate.  Where happenstance has made a 
matter moot, the standard practice is to vacate the decision of 
the district court.  Columbian Rope, 142 F.3d at 1317.  The 
exception that is applied when mootness results from volun-
tary action of a party, see Nat'l Black Police Ass'n, 108 F.3d 
at 351, is inappropriate here because Pharmachemie, the only 
party to whose actions mootness could be attributed, pre-
vailed in the district court.  U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. 
Bonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 (1994).  Although, gener-
ally, when the court declines review of an agency order on the 
ground of intervening mootness as a result of happenstance, 

vacatur of the agency order is appropriate, Columbian Rope, 
142 F.3d at 1318 & n.5;  see also A.L. Mechling Barge Lines, 
Inc. v. United States, 368 U.S. 324, 329 (1961);  Am. Family 
Life Assurance Co. of Columbus v. FCC, 129 F.3d 625, 630 
(D.C. Cir. 1997), we do not vacate FDA's ruling;  Pharmache-
mie did not request such vacatur and its failure to appeal the 
judgment upholding the patent constituted voluntary action 
that led to the mootness of the instant case, see Nat'l Black 
Police Ass'n, 108 F.3d at 351.  Accordingly, we dismiss the 
appeal as moot, vacate the judgment of the district court, and 
remand the case to the district court with instructions to 
dismiss the complaint.
