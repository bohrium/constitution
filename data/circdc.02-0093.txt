     Before:  Sentelle, Henderson and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.

     Per Curiam:  The appellant, Floyd Bruce, seeks reversal of 
the district court's July 30, 2001 sentencing decision, see App. 
of Appellant at 143-98, in which the court concluded that the 
policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the United States 
Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) are not binding upon sen-
tencing courts.  Bruce contends, simply, that the court erred 
in so holding and that we should remand for resentencing.  
We disagree.

                                I.

     In December 1994 a grand jury issued a two-count indict-
ment against Bruce, charging him with bank fraud, in viola-
tion of 18 U.S.C. s 1344 (Count One), and with uttering and 
possessing forged securities of an organization, in violation of 
18 U.S.C. s 513(a) (Count Two).  In February 1995 the petit 
jury found Bruce guilty on both counts.  The district court 
sentenced him to a term of 24 months' imprisonment, which 
was to be followed by three years of supervised release.  
Bruce appealed his conviction and we affirmed.  See United 
States v. Bruce, 89 F.3d 886 (D.C. Cir. 1996).

     Bruce served his time and was released on August 28, 1996;  
accordingly, he was to remain on supervised release until 
August 27, 1999.  On October 7, 1997 the Probation Office 
notified the district court that Bruce had violated his release 
conditions because he had been arrested twice in New York 
for motor vehicle violations, had twice tested positive for 
marijuana and had failed to make restitution payments.  The 
district court found that Bruce had indeed violated his release 
conditions;  it therefore extended his supervised release peri-
od by one year--to end on August 27, 2000--and ordered him 
to serve a 90-day period of monitored home confinement, to 
participate in a drug aftercare program and to make monthly 
restitution payments.

     On January 22, 1998 and March 26, 1998 the Probation 
Office forwarded reports to the district court advising it that 

Bruce had once again violated his release conditions by (1) 
being arrested for and charged with larceny in New York in 
October 1997;  (2) failing to notify his probation officer of the 
arrest;  (3) failing to make restitution payments as ordered;  
(4) failing to attend drug counseling as ordered;  (5) failing to 
adjust his telephone service to accommodate electronic moni-
toring as ordered;  (6) being arrested yet again in New York 
for forgery, possession of a forged instrument and possession 
of stolen property;  (7) failing to notify his probation officer of 
the arrest;  and (8) making false statements to his probation 
officer that he is a United States citizen.

     After Bruce failed to appear at a June 2, 1998 hearing, the 
district court issued a warrant for his arrest.  Bruce re-
mained a fugitive until he was arrested on October 26, 2000 in 
Blue Ash, Ohio, where he was indicted in state court on 
several counts of theft, possessing criminal tools and receiving 
stolen property.  He was returned to the District of Columbia 
and brought into custody on January 10, 2001 pursuant to the 
district court's warrant.  At a July 2001 status hearing Bruce 
told the district court that he did not wish to contest the eight 
supervised release violations alleged by the government and 
that he preferred to proceed to resentencing.

     At his July 30 resentencing hearing, Bruce waived his right 
to contest the violations.  The parties did not dispute (1) that 
by statute, the maximum sentence of imprisonment the court 
could impose for the violations was 36 months, see 18 U.S.C. 
s 3583(e)(3) (a "defendant whose [supervised release] term is 
revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve 
... more than 3 years in prison if [his] offense [of conviction] 
is a class B felony");  or (2) that the sentence provided in 
Chapter 7 for a defendant (like Bruce) with a criminal history 
of category II was six to 12 months, see U.S.S.G. s 7B1.4.  
The parties did argue, however, about whether Chapter 7 is 
binding upon the district court.  Bruce contended that a 1994 
amendment to 18 U.S.C. s 3553 had rendered Chapter 7's 
policy statements mandatory;  thus, he claimed that the court 
was obligated to sentence him within the six- to 12-month 
range.  The government argued that the amendment effected 
no such change in the law and that the court was free to 

impose a sentence of up to 36 months under section 
3583(e)(3).

     The district court concluded that Chapter 7's policy state-
ments are not binding.  The court based its decision, first, 
upon our pre-1994 holding in United States v. Hooker, 993 
F.2d 898 (D.C. Cir. 1993), that the policy statements are not 
mandatory and, second, upon several post-1994 circuit court 
decisions concluding that the policy statements--even after 
the amendment to 18 U.S.C. s 3553--remain non-binding.  
The court, therefore, held that it could impose a sentence of 
up to 36 months' incarceration for Bruce's uncontested super-
vised release violations but sentenced him instead to 24 
months, finding that it would be "to a certain extent illogical" 
to sentence him to "a period of time that exceeds what he was 
sentenced to originally."  App. of Appellant at 196.  Bruce 
timely filed a notice of appeal.

                               II.

     Bruce claims that the district court erred in sentencing him 
to a prison term of 24 months by declining to follow U.S.S.G. 
s 7B1.4's revocation table.  He argues that the supervised 
release policy statements contained in Chapter 7--section 
7B1.4 included--are binding on the district court and that he 
should have received only six to 12 months.  As noted above, 
we held in Hooker that "the Chapter VII policy statements 
themselves are merely advisory."  Hooker, 993 F.2d at 900.  
Accordingly, the sole legal issue before us is whether, as 
Bruce contends, the Congress's post-Hooker amendment to 
18 U.S.C. s 3553(a) rendered the policy statements mandato-
ry.  Addressing that issue de novo, see United States v. Yeh, 
278 F.3d 9, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2002), we hold that it did not.

     In 1990 the United States Sentencing Commission (Com-
mission) promulgated Chapter 7's policy statements pursuant 
to its authority to prescribe "guidelines or general policy 
statements regarding the appropriate use of the provisions 
for ... modification of the term or conditions of supervised 
release and revocation of supervised release set forth in 
section 3583(e) of title 18."  28 U.S.C. s 994(a)(3).  The 

Commission made clear that "[a]fter considered debate" it 
had decided to promulgate only policy statements--not guide-
lines--with respect to supervised release revocation.  U.S. 
Sentencing Guidelines Manual ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. 
(2001).  It believed that "this approach [would] provide[ ] 
greater flexibility to both the Commission and the courts" and 
that "the additional time to consider complex issues relating 
to revocation guidelines ... [would] provide better opportuni-
ties for evaluation."  Id.  The Commission also advised that it 
"intend[ed] to promulgate revocation guidelines" after "an 
adequate period of evaluation."  Id.  It has yet to do so.

     At the time Hooker was decided, 18 U.S.C. s 3553 ("Impo-
sition of a sentence") provided, in pertinent part:

     (a) Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.-
     The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not 
     greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set 
     forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection [including such 
     purposes as deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilita-
     tion].  The court, in determining the particular sentence 
     to be imposed, shall consider ...
     
          (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range 
          established for the applicable category of offense com-
          mitted by the applicable category of defendant as set 
          forth in the guidelines that are issued by the Sentenc-
          ing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(1)1 and 
          that are in effect on the date the defendant is sen-
          tenced;
          
          (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sen-
          tencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(2)2 
          
__________
     1 Section 994(a)(1) provides that the Commission has the authori-
ty to promulgate "guidelines ... for use of a sentencing court in 
determining the sentence to be imposed in a criminal case."  28 
U.S.C. s 994(a)(1).

     2 Section 994(a)(2) provides that the Commission has the authori-
ty to promulgate "general policy statements regarding application 
of the guidelines or any other aspect of sentencing or sentence 
implementation that in the view of the Commission would further 
[sentencing] purposes."  28 U.S.C. s 994(a)(2).

          that is in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced;  
          ...
          
     (b) Application of guidelines in imposing a sentence.-
     The court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within 
     the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4) unless the 
     court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating 
     circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately 
     taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission 
     in formulating the guidelines that should result in a 
     sentence different from that described.  In determining 
     whether a circumstance was adequately taken into con-
     sideration, the court shall consider only the sentencing 
     guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of 
     the Sentencing Commission.  In the absence of an appli-
     cable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an 
     appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes 
     set forth in subsection (a)(2).  In the absence of an 
     applicable sentencing guideline in the case of an offense 
     other than a petty offense, the court shall also have due 
     regard for the relationship of the sentence imposed to 
     sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar 
     offenses and offenders, and to the applicable policy 
     statements of the Sentencing Commission.
     
18 U.S.C. s 3553 (1988) (emphases added).

     In 1994, after Hooker, the Congress amended section 3553 
by dividing subsection (a)(4) into two parts as follows:

     (a) Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence. 
     The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not 
     greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set 
     forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection [including such 
     purposes as deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilita-
     tion].  The court, in determining the particular sentence 
     to be imposed, shall consider ...
     
          (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range 
          established for--
          
           (A) the applicable category of offense committed 
      by the applicable category of defendant as set 
           forth in the guidelines issued by the Sentencing 
     
          Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title 
          28, United States Code, and that are in effect on 
          the date the defendant is sentenced;  or
     
          (B) in the case of a violation of probation or 
          supervised release, the applicable guidelines or 
          policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com-
          mission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, 
          United States Code;  ...
          
18 U.S.C. s 3553(a) (emphases added).  Subsection (b) ("Ap-
plication of guidelines in imposing a sentence") remained 
unchanged after the 1994 amendment.

     Bruce's syllogistic argument proceeds as follows:  first, 
section 3553(b) requires the district court to "impose a sen-
tence of the kind and within the range referred to in subsec-
tion (a)(4)";  second, after Hooker, subsection (a)(4) was 
amended to include reference to "applicable guidelines or 
policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission" for 
supervised release violations;  therefore, in amending (a)(4), 
the Congress was announcing that a district court must 
impose a sentence for a supervised release violation within 
the range provided by the Commission, whether that range is 
set forth in a guideline or a policy statement.  As Bruce 
candidly acknowledges, all of the circuits that have considered 
the issue before us have "unanimously rejected his position," 
Br. of Appellant at 18, holding that the 1994 amendment did 
not render Chapter 7's policy statements binding on sentenc-
ing courts.  See United States v. Brown, 203 F.3d 557, 558 
(8th Cir. 2000) (per curiam);  United States v. George, 184 
F.3d 1119, 1120-22 (9th Cir. 1999);  United States v. Schwegel, 
126 F.3d 551, 552-55 (3d Cir. 1997) (per curiam);  United 
States v. Cohen, 99 F.3d 69, 70-71 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam), 
cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1213 (1997);  United States v. Hofierka, 
83 F.3d 357, 360-61 (11th Cir. 1996) (per curiam), cert. denied, 
519 U.S. 1071 (1997);  United States v. Escamilla, 70 F.3d 
835, 835 (5th Cir. 1995) (per curiam), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 
1127 (1996);  United States v. West, 59 F.3d 32, 33-36 (6th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 980 (1995).  Because Bruce's logic 
finds no support in the statutory text, we decline to break 
rank with our sister circuits.

     The plain language of section 3553(a) merely states that a 
district court must "consider ... the applicable guidelines or 
policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pur-
suant to section 994(a)(3)" when imposing a sentence for a 
violation of supervised release.  18 U.S.C. s 3553(a)(4)(B) 
(emphasis added).  To "consider" means to "reflect on," 
"think about," "deliberate," "ponder" or "study."  Webster's 
Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged 483 (1993).  
It does not mean to "adhere to," "be bound by" or "follow."

     Turning to section 3553(b), one sees that it unambiguously 
requires a sentencing court to "impose a sentence of the kind, 
and within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4)."  18 
U.S.C. s 3553(b).  Bruce contends that because subsection 
(a)(4)--specifically (a)(4)(B)--now references policy state-
ments, sentencing courts must adhere to those statements by 
virtue of section 3553(b)'s mandate.  His interpretation is not 
entirely implausible;  while our sister circuits all appear to 
agree that the purpose of the 1994 amendment was "to clarify 
that resentencing for probation and supervised release viola-
tions should be based upon sentencing guidelines and policy 
statements issued by the Commission specifically for that 
purpose, rather than upon the guidelines applicable to ... the 
original offense," George, 184 F.3d at 1121-22 (quoting 
Schwegel, 126 F.3d at 554) (internal quotations omitted), the 
Congress could have made its aim somewhat clearer textual-
ly.  Indeed, as Bruce suggested at oral argument, it could 
have amended section 3553(b) to require imposition of "a 
sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in 
subsection (a)(4)(A) [as opposed to (a)(4)]," thus requiring--
explicitly--application of the guidelines but only consideration 
of the policy statements.  The "Congress-could-have" argu-
ment, however, works as much to Bruce's detriment as it does 
to his advantage.  As its heading suggests, section 3553(b) 
pertains to "[a]pplication of [the] guidelines" and only asks a 
court to "consider" or have "due regard for" the "applicable 
policy statements" in "the absence of an applicable sentencing 
guideline."  18 U.S.C. s 3553(b) (emphasis added).  Thus, as 
the Second Circuit has put it, "[a]bsent any applicable guide-
lines in Chapter 7, s 3553(b)'s mandatory language does not 

apply."  Cohen, 99 F.3d at 71 (citing West, 59 F.3d at 35).  
Without much difficulty, the Congress could have amended 
3553(b) to require adherence to policy statements.  It did not;  
accordingly, we are left with a statute that plainly requires a 
district court to apply guidelines (where they exist) but 
merely consider (i.e., "reflect on," "think about," "deliberate," 
"ponder" or "study") policy statements.

     Bruce resists this conclusion, claiming that "it is not at all 
clear whether Congress intended the term 'guidelines' [in 
section 3553(b)] to exclude policy statements."  Br. of Appel-
lant at 19.  For several reasons, we disagree.  First, in 
mutually exclusive terms, section 994(a)(3) of title 28 requires 
the Commission to promulgate "guidelines or general policy 
statements regarding the appropriate use of the provisions 
for ... modification of the term or conditions of supervised 
release and revocation of supervised release set forth in 
section 3583(e) of title 18."  28 U.S.C. s 994(a)(3) (emphasis 
added).  Second, pursuant to that responsibility, the Commis-
sion chose to promulgate non-binding policy statements to 
preserve the "flexibility [of] both the Commission and the 
courts" until the Commission had sufficient time to evaluate 
fully the "complex issues relating to revocation guidelines."  
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual ch. 7, pt. A, introductory 
cmt. (2001) (emphasis added).  Significantly, in the several 
years since the 1994 amendment--during which time the 
courts have repeatedly rejected Bruce's theory--neither the 
Congress nor the Commission has done anything to call into 
question the Commission's initial decision to prescribe policy 
statements in lieu of guidelines.  Until one or both of them do 
so, we will not disturb the discretion of the district court to 
sentence a supervised release violator in a manner consistent 
with 18 U.S.C. s 3583(e).

                               III.

     The district court sentenced Bruce to 24 months' incarcera-
tion, a term which is well within the statutory limit.  See 18 
U.S.C. s 3583(e)(3).  Because we conclude that the court's 

discretion was not otherwise restricted, we affirm its resen-
tencing of Bruce.

                                             `              So ordered.
