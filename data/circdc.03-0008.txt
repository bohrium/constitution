     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  The principal question on appeal is 
whether Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act 
("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. s 552(b)(3) (2000), permits the Depart-
ment of Commerce to withhold from public disclosure infor-
mation contained in export license applications.  This deter-
mination requires the court to address the nature of the 
reference in FOIA Exemption 3 to statutes allowing docu-
ments to be withheld.  Under the Export Administration Act, 
50 U.S.C. app. ss 2401-20 (2000), which from time to time 
has been enacted as temporary legislation, manufacturers of 
dual-use commodities -- that is, products that can be used for 
both military and civilian purposes -- must obtain a license 
from the Department before they may export their products.  
The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control ("the Wis-
consin Project") requested access under FOIA to these ex-
port license applications.  The Department responded by 
providing aggregate data while declining, under Exemption 3, 
to supply much of the requested specific export data.  In 
light of the unique statutory framework created by Congress 
to retain the confidentiality of export data, we affirm the 
grant of summary judgment to the Department.

                                I.

     The Export Administration Act ("EAA") authorizes the 
Department of Commerce to establish a regulatory scheme 
governing the export of dual-use items.  50 U.S.C. app. 

ss 2401-20.  The Department accordingly promulgated the 
Export Administration Regulations ("export regulations"), 
which set forth exporters' obligations and specify the types of 
products that are subject to the EAA's requirements.  15 
C.F.R. ss 730-74 (2002).  Section 12(c) of the EAA provides 
that "information obtained for the purpose of consideration of, 
or concerning, license applications under this Act shall be 
withheld from public disclosure unless the release of such 
information is determined by the Secretary [of Commerce] to 
be in the national interest."  50 U.S.C. app. s 2411(c).  The 
Department has incorporated this confidentiality provision 
into the export regulations.  15 C.F.R. pt. 736, supp. 2 (2002).

     Congress originally enacted the export control system as 
part of the Export Control Act of 1949, Pub. L. 81-11, s 6(c), 
63 Stat. 7, 8-9, and subsequently replaced it with the Export 
Administration Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-184, s 7(c), 83 Stat. 
841, 845.  Congress has enacted each version of the statute as 
a temporary measure, explaining that "such important regula-
tory legislation should be periodically reviewed."  H.R. Rep. 
No. 95-459, at 13 (1977).  From time to time, however, 
Congress has amended the EAA to reinstate its provisions 
and on each occasion has included a sunset provision specify-
ing the date on which the EAA will expire.  50 U.S.C. app. 
s 2419 (2000).  The current version of the statute -- the 
EAA of 1979 -- has lapsed six times, for periods ranging 
from as short as five days to as long as six years.  Each time 
the EAA has expired, the President has promptly declared a 
national emergency and has extended the regulatory scheme 
by executive order.  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13,222, 3 
C.F.R. 783 (2002);  Exec. Order No. 12,867, 3 C.F.R. 649 
(1994);  Exec. Order No. 12,730, 3 C.F.R. 305 (1991);  Exec. 
Order No. 12,470, 3 C.F.R. 168 (1985);  Exec. Order No. 
12,444, 3 C.F.R. 214 (1984);  Exec. Order No. 11,940, 3 C.F.R. 
150 (1977).

     Originally the President relied on a provision in the Trad-
ing with the Enemy Act ("TWEA"), 50 U.S.C. app. s 5(b) 
(2000), for authorization to continue the export control system 
during lapses in the EAA.  In 1977, however, Congress 
reformed the TWEA by enacting the International Emergen-

cy Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA") and provided that the 
President, upon declaration of a national emergency, may 
"regulate ... prevent or prohibit ... importation or exporta-
tion of ... any property in which any foreign country or a 
national thereof has any interest ... by any person, or with 
respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States."  50 U.S.C. s 1702(a)(1) (2000).  In enacting 
IEEPA, Congress reaffirmed the President's regulatory con-
trol over exports by broadening the scope of the EAA to 
include regulation of extraterritorial exports.  Pub. L. No. 
95-223, s 301, 91 Stat. 1625, 1629 (codified as amended at 50 
U.S.C. app. ss 2402-03 (2000)).  IEEPA's legislative history, 
moreover, indicates that Congress intended the President to 
use his authority under IEEPA "to continue the Export 
Administration Regulations in effect" should a "lapse" occur 
in the EAA.  H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 13 (1977).  (No 
Conference Report exists, and the Senate Report is silent on 
this point.)

     The EAA of 1979 expired by its terms in 1994, and the 
President, pursuant to IEEPA, again extended the export 
controls by Executive Order.  The President declared that 
the EAA's expiration posed "an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States" and constituted a national emergency.  
Exec. Order No. 12,924, 59 Fed. Reg. 43,437 (Aug. 19, 1994), 
reprinted in 50 U.S.C. s 1701 (2000).  The President ordered 
that the EAA's provisions "be carried out under this order so 
as to continue in full force and effect...."  Id.

     On July 27, 1999, during the period when the EAA had 
lapsed, the Wisconsin Project submitted a request under 
FOIA to the Department for "records of all license applica-
tions for dual-use commodities that the U.S. Department of 
Commerce approved, denied, suspended, or returned without 
action, for export to the People's Republic of China (including 
Hong Kong), India, Israel, Pakistan, and Russia, for the 
period beginning January 1, 1995 and extending to the pres-
ent."  The request stated that it included "information show-
ing the federal agencies to which each license application was 

referred for review, ... each agency's recommendation on 
the application referred, ... the applicant, the case number, 
the date received, the final date, the consignee-end user, the 
[Export Control Classification Number], the value and the 
statement of end use."  The Department responded by letter 
dated August 24, 1999, turning over reports showing aggre-
gate data for the specified countries while stating that the 
more detailed information was exempt from disclosure under 
FOIA Exemption 3.

     After exhausting its administrative remedies, the Wisconsin 
Project sued in the district court for release of the detailed 
export information.  While the lawsuit was pending, Congress 
reenacted the EAA, extending its expiration date from Au-
gust 20, 1994, to August 20, 2001.  Pub. L. 106-508, 114 Stat. 
2360 (2000) (codified at 50 U.S.C. app. s 2419).  Before the 
district court ruled on the Department's motion for summary 
judgment, the August 2001 expiration date passed, and the 
President once more extended the EAA's export controls by 
Executive Order.  Exec. Order No. 13,222, 3 C.F.R. 783 
(2002).  The district court granted the Department's motion 
on September 4, 2001.  Citing statements by Members of 
Congress and the President, the district court concluded that 
Congress's amendment of the EAA in 2000 made clear that 
the EAA covered the time period when the Wisconsin Pro-
ject's request for records was pending before the Depart-
ment, and it ruled that the amended EAA did not constitute 
an unconstitutional retroactive application of a new statute to 
prior conduct.

                               II.

     The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is " 'to 
pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and open agency 
action to the light of public scrutiny....' "  Dep't of the Air 
Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976) (citation omitted).  
FOIA embodies " 'a general philosophy of full agency disclo-
sure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated 
statutory language.' "  Id. at 360-61 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 
89th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1965)).  FOIA accordingly mandates 

a "strong presumption in favor of disclosure," United States 
Dep't of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991), under which 
the statutory exemptions to disclosure are to be "narrowly 
construed," Rose, 425 U.S. at 361.  The exemptions, however, 
are to be given "meaningful reach and application."  John 
Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989).  In 
reviewing de novo a grant of summary judgment for the 
government in a FOIA case, the court remains particularly 
"mindful that the 'burden is on the agency' to show that 
requested material falls within a FOIA exemption."  Petrole-
um Info. Corp. v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 976 
F.2d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

     Exemption 3 takes literally the requirement that disclosure 
prevail absent "clearly delineated statutory language," Rose, 
425 U.S. at 361.  Under Exemption 3, agencies may withhold 
information "specifically exempted from disclosure by statute 
... provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters 
be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no 
discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria 
for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be 
withheld."  5 U.S.C. s 552(b)(3).  To qualify as a withholding 
provision, a statute must be "the product of congressional 
appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data" 
and must "incorporate[ ] a formula whereby the administrator 
may determine precisely whether the disclosure in any in-
stance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw."  Am. 
Jewish Cong. v. Kreps, 574 F.2d 624, 628-29 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  
In short, "only explicit nondisclosure statutes that evidence a 
congressional determination that certain materials ought to 
be kept in confidence will be sufficient to qualify under the 
exemption."  Irons & Sears v. Dann, 606 F.2d 1215, 1220 
(D.C. Cir. 1979).

     Exemption 3 has evolved from its original text to require 
that Congress, not the agencies of the Executive Branch, 
determine the need for nondisclosure.  Congress amended 
Exemption 3 in 1976 in response to the Supreme Court's 
decision in Administrator, FAA v. Robertson, 422 U.S. 255, 
266-67 (1975), which held that s 1104 of the Federal Aviation 
Act of 1958 ("FAA"), 49 U.S.C. s 1504 (2000), constituted an 
Exemption 3 withholding statute.  The FAA authorized the 

Administrator to withhold information from public disclosure 
"when, in [the Administrator's] judgment, a disclosure of such 
information ... is not required in the interest of the public."  
Robertson, 422 U.S. at 257 n.4.  Concerned that Robertson 
"afford[ed] the FAA Administrator cart[e] blanche to with-
hold any information he please[d]," Congress overruled the 
decision and narrowed Exemption 3 by adding subsections 
(A) and (B).  H.R. Rep. No. 94-880, pt. 1, at 23 (1976), 
reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2204-05 ("H.R. Rep. 
No. 94-880").  As this court has explained:

     The amended text and its legislative history make 
     clear that Congress did not want the exemption to 
     be triggered by every statute that in any way gives 
     administrators discretion to withhold documents 
     from the public.  On the contrary, Congress intend-
     ed exemption from the FOIA to be a legislative 
     determination and not an administrative one.
     
Irons & Sears, 606 F.2d at 1220 (footnote omitted).  A statute 
qualifies as a withholding statute under Exemption 3, then, 
where "Congress ha[s] itself made the basic decision, and 
ha[s] left to the administrator only the task of implementa-
tion."  Am. Jewish Cong., 574 F.2d at 630.

     This court has previously considered the application of 
Exemption 3 to the EAA.  In 1978, in American Jewish 
Congress v. Kreps, the court held that the disclosure provision 
of the EAA of 1969 did not specify the types of matters to be 
withheld with sufficient particularity.  574 F.2d at 630-31.  
The court explained that Congress, in amending Exemption 3, 
clarified that statutes that merely "set forth benchmarks for 
secrecy so general as the 'interest of the public' " (such as the 
statute at issue in Robertson) do not satisfy subsection (B)'s 
"particular criteria" requirement.  Id. at 629.  "When, on the 
other hand, Congress has made plain its concern with a 
specific effect of publicity ... Exemption 3 is to honor that 
concern."  Id.  Because the nondisclosure provision in the 
EAA of 1969 referred only to "information obtained" under 
the Act, id. at 626, the court concluded that the statutory 
language was too broad to justify withholding information 

under Exemption 3, id. at 631.  The court, in light of the 
EAA's lapse in 1976, had no occasion to reach "the thorny 
question whether material that, when submitted, was 'specifi-
cally exempted from disclosure by statute' lost its exemption 
once the statute went into remission."  Id. (footnote omitted).

     Following the court's decision in American Jewish Con-
gress, Congress enacted the EAA of 1979 and amended the 
statute's nondisclosure provision.  Pub. L. 96-72, s 12(c), 93 
Stat. 503, 531 (1979) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. app. 
s 2411(c)).  Section 12(c) now specifies the particular types of 
matters to be withheld -- namely, "information obtained for 
the purpose of consideration of, or concerning, license applica-
tions under this Act...."  50 U.S.C. app. s 2411(c).  Thus, 
we have little difficulty concluding that section 12(c) qualifies 
as an Exemption 3 statute.  Times Publ'g Co. v. United 
States Dep't of Commerce, 236 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir. 
2001);  Lessner v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 827 F.2d 
1333, 1337 (9th Cir. 1987) (per curiam);  Durnan v. United 
States Dep't of Commerce, 777 F. Supp. 965, 966 (D.D.C. 
1991).  As a result, the "thorny question" to be addressed 
here is whether the Department may withhold export applica-
tion data submitted during a period of lapse in the EAA, the 
mirror image of the "thorny question" in American Jewish 
Congress.

     The Wisconsin Project contends that the Department may 
not withhold the data, and the logic of its argument is simple:  
Exemption 3, by its text, requires that a withholding "statute" 
be in place;  because the EAA was not in effect either when 
the exporters submitted their application data to the Depart-
ment or when the Wisconsin Project requested that data from 
the Department under FOIA, no statute exists to justify the 
Department's withholding of the requested data.  The Wis-
consin Project's formalistic logic, however, misses the bigger 
picture.  As the foregoing discussion of this circuit's prece-
dents indicates, the touchstone of the Exemption 3 inquiry is 

whether the statute "is the product of congressional apprecia-
tion of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and 
incorporates a formula whereby the administrator may deter-
mine precisely whether disclosure in any instance would pose 
the hazard that Congress foresaw."  Am. Jewish Cong., 574 
F.2d at 628-29.

     Congress's actions throughout the long history of the EAA 
evince a clear appreciation of the dangers inherent in expos-
ing export application data to public view.  Since it was first 
enacted by Congress, the EAA has always contained a confi-
dentiality provision that permits the Department to withhold 
export application data.  See 50 U.S.C. app. s 2411(c);  EAA 
of 1969, Pub. L. 91-184, s 7(c), 83 Stat. 841, 845;  Export 
Control Act of 1949, Pub. L. 81-11, s 6(c), 63 Stat. 7, 8-9.  In 
1977, as Congress prepared to renew the EAA's provisions, 
the Department urged Congress "to grant a blanket exemp-
tion from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 
with respect to all information" submitted under the EAA.  
H.R. Rep. No. 95-190, at 18 (1977), reprinted in 1977 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 362, 379.  Declining the invitation, the House 
International Relations Committee explained that "[a]ny such 
information which is legitimately confidential is, in the opinion 
of the committee, adequately protected by the exemptions of 
the Freedom Information Act and section 7(c) of the Export 
Administration Act."  Id.  Congress reaffirmed this view two 
years later when, in enacting the EAA of 1979, it replaced 
section 7(c) with an amended section 12(c) in order to protect 
the export data from disclosure under the court's opinion in 
American Jewish Congress.  Pub. L. 96-72, s 12(c), 93 Stat. 
503, 531 (1979) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. app. 
s 2411(c)).

     The legislative history indicates that Congress intended to 
preserve these confidentiality protections when it renewed 
the EAA in November 2000.  In commenting on the original 
House version of the 2000 bill, Representative Gilman noted 
that "the Department is ... currently defending against two 
separate lawsuits seeking public release of export licensing 
information," and he explained that the bill would "make sure 
that [the Department] can keep the information confiden-

tial...."  146 Cong. Rec. H8022 (daily ed. Sept. 25, 2000).  
Senator Gramm, commenting on the final version of the 
legislation, stated that the statute "will make clear that [the 
Department's] authority to apply the 12(c) confidentiality 
provision of the 1979 act is to be considered as covering any 
information regarding license applications obtained during 
that time period, as if there had been no interruption of 
authority."  146 Cong. Rec. S11365 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 2000).  
The Wisconsin Project rightly notes that the legislative histo-
ry is not entirely uniform on this point.  Representative 
Gilman, for example, indicated that the bill's final language 
left him uncertain whether the amendment would clearly 
protect all information submitted between 1994 and 2000 from 
disclosure.  146 Cong. Rec. H11575-76 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 
2000).  But regardless of whether every Member of Congress 
agreed on the amendment's effect, the Members determined 
that the confidentiality provision is important to the function-
ing of the export control system;  otherwise they would not 
have included it as part of the renewed EAA.  And that 
determination is the touchstone of this circuit's Exemption 3 
inquiry.  Irons & Sears, 606 F.2d at 1220.

     The Wisconsin Project fails to acknowledge that the EAA is 
not the only statute that reflects Congress's determination 
regarding the confidentiality of export application informa-
tion.  Congress enacted IEEPA out of concern that export 
controls remain in place without interruption, and the accom-
panying Report of the House International Relations Com-
mittee included the following statement:

           The committee rejected administration recommenda-
     tions that it make the Export Administration Act 
          permanent legislation, because it feels that such 
          important regulatory legislation should be periodi-
          cally reviewed....  Should a lapse [in the EAA] 
          occur, however, the authority of [IEEPA] could be 
          used to continue the Export Administration Regula-
          tions in effect if, and to the extent that, the Presi-
          dent declared a national emergency as a result of 
          such lapse....
     
H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 13 (1977).  Although the legislative 
history does not refer to the EAA's confidentiality provision, 
it does evince Congress's intent to authorize the President to 
preserve the operation of the export regulations promulgated 
under the EAA.  Moreover, it is significant for purposes of 
determining legislative intent that Congress acted with the 
knowledge that the EAA's export regulations had long pro-
vided for confidentiality and that the President's ongoing 
practice of extending the EAA by executive order had always 
included these confidentiality protections.  Cf. United States 
v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 469-74 (1915).  Thus, in 
Irons & Sears, the court was "extremely reluctant to impute 
to Congress an intent to eliminate the long-standing confiden-
tiality accorded to patent applications absent rather unambig-
uous indications that this is what the Congress really want-
ed."  606 F.2d at 1220-21.  A similar approach is appropriate 
here in light of Congress's express desire, as evidenced by its 
enactment of IEEPA and its knowledge of a pattern of 
consistent lapse-filling by executive order, to hold export 
application information in confidence.

     Although Congress might have chosen to act in a manner 
that reflects the Wisconsin Project's formalistic emphasis on 
Exemption 3's requirement of a withholding statute -- by, for 
example, making the EAA and section 12(c) permanent legis-
lation -- it did not, for reasons it explained.  H.R. Rep. No. 
95-459, at 13.  Consequently, for purposes of determining 
congressional intent with respect to withholding certain ex-
port data from the public, considering the EAA in conjunction 
with other statutes is not inconsistent with FOIA's purpose or 
Exemption 3's text.  Exemption 3 contemplates withholding 
pursuant to "clearly delineated statutory language," a phrase 
that admits of more than a single statutory source.  Through 
the concerted operation of three congressional statutes -- the 
EAA, the TWEA, and IEEPA -- and in light of the Depart-
ment's regulations and the President's executive orders pur-
suant to those statutes, the export control system has re-
mained in place without interruption for over fifty years.  50 
U.S.C. app. s 2401-20 (2000);  EAA of 1969, Pub. L. 91-184, 
83 Stat. 841, 845;  Export Control Act of 1949, Pub. L. 81-11, 

63 Stat. 7, 8-9.  During that time, the Department has always 
retained the authority to withhold export license application 
information from public disclosure.  50 U.S.C. app. s 2411(c);  
EAA of 1969, Pub. L. 91-184, s 7(c), 83 Stat. 841, 845;  
Export Control Act of 1949, Pub. L. 81-11, s 6(c), 63 Stat. 7, 
8-9.  The Wisconsin Project points to nothing to indicate that 
this is not as the Congress intended.

     While the Wisconsin Project's approach is attractive in its 
simplicity, it fails to come to grips with the statutory scheme 
Congress has erected for export data.  The Wisconsin Project 
would effectively require the court to hold that Congress 
must act by a single statute if its legislation is to qualify as a 
withholding statute under Exemption 3, and that the confi-
dentiality of the export data is undone by the EAA's expira-
tion notwithstanding Congress's expectations to the contrary.  
In allowing the EAA to lapse from time to time, Congress has 
focused on a series of difficult and controversial questions 
having, so far as we are aware, nothing to do with its 
expectation that export data would remain confidential.  See

Journal, Feb. 19, 1983, at 380.  Furthermore, the statutory 
scheme for ensuring the confidentiality of certain export data 
has none of the FAA's vagaries that concerned Congress, for 
the statutes do not "afford [the President] cart[e] blanche to 
withhold any information he pleases."  H.R. Rep. No. 94-880, 
pt. 1, at 23.

     FOIA undoubtedly demands a liberal presumption of dis-
closure.  But the Supreme Court has observed that the 
"statutory exemptions are intended to have meaningful reach 
and application."  John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152.  The 
Wisconsin Project's unduly strict reading of Exemption 3 
strangles Congress's intent and deprives the exemption of 
meaningful reach in the context of the export regulatory 
scheme.  In rejecting this approach, the court does not 
diminish the requirement that an agency's decision not to 
disclose materials under Exemption 3 must be based upon 

"clearly delineated statutory language" that provides stan-
dards for withholding.  In Founding Church of Scientology v. 
Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (per curiam), the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation invoked Exemption 3 in 
withholding documents that a trial court in another proceed-
ing had sealed under Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  The court held that "Exemption 3 is explicitly 
confined to material exempted from disclosure 'by statute,' 
and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure simply do not 
satisfy this description."  Id. at 952.  The court noted that 
the rules "are issued by the Supreme Court under rulemak-
ing powers delegated by Congress.  Although proposed rules 
may be rejected by Congress, they are not affirmatively 
adopted by the legislature, as all statutes must be."  Id. 
(footnotes omitted).  Most importantly, the court observed 
that "the rule's standards for issuing protective orders do not 
comport with the criteria set forth in Exemption 3," because 
the rule affords broad discretion to the trial court and does 
not identify particular types of matters to be withheld.  Id.  
There is no dispute, as the Wisconsin Project points out, that 
the EAA's export regulations and executive orders, like the 
Federal Rules, are not congressionally enacted statutes.  See 
INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 945-46 (1983).  But Bell is 
inapposite because the Federal Rules were originated and 
written not by Congress but by the Supreme Court, whereas 
the executive order here continued precisely the provision 
originated and written by Congress.

     Our conclusion accords with the decision of the Eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Times Publishing Co. v. United 
States Department of Commerce, 236 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th 
Cir. 2001).  The Eleventh Circuit confronted the same ques-
tion:  whether the Department may withhold export applica-
tion information under Exemption 3 even where the EAA has 
expired.  The court began with the principle established in 
this court's precedent that, "[w]here Congress has made plain 
its intention to exclude the information ... from public 
disclosure under FOIA, the purpose of Exemption 3 -- to 
ensure that 'basic policy decisions on governmental secrecy 
are made by the Legislative rather than the Executive 

branch' -- is satisfied."  Id. (quoting Am. Jewish Cong., 574 
F.2d at 628).  The court then noted that "Congress has 
renewed the confidentiality provision each time it has re-
newed the EAA" and that "Congress has authorized the 
President, also by means of statute, to maintain the force of 
the confidentiality provision by way of executive order."  Id. 
at 1291.  The court thus concluded "Congress has acted 
specifically to design a statutory provision to maintain confi-
dentiality."  Id.  It followed that "the comprehensive legisla-
tive scheme as a whole -- the confidentiality provision of the 
EAA, the intended and foreseen periodic expiration of the 
EAA, and the Congressional grant of power to the President 
to prevent the lapse of its important provisions during such 
times -- exempts from disclosure the export licensing infor-
mation requested by Appellees."  Id. at 1292.  We agree.

     Finally, because IEEPA qualifies as an Exemption 3 stat-
ute, there can be no retroactivity problem.  The Wisconsin 
Project contends that even if the EAA, with its concomitant 
regulations and executive orders, qualifies as an Exemption 3 
withholding statute, applying the 2000 EAA amendment to 
protect the Department's 1994-2000 data improperly affords 
the amendment retroactive effect.  But the reenactment of 
the EAA confirmed, with respect to confidentiality, what has 
been the case all along.  Hence, contrary to the Wisconsin 
Project's claim, in light of clear congressional intent, no "new 
legal consequences" are being attached "to events completed 
before its enactment," Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 
244, 270 (1994), as would make application of the EAA 
impermissibly retroactive.

     Accordingly, because the Department of Commerce proper-
ly invoked Exemption 3 in withholding specific export applica-
tion data in response to the Wisconsin Project's request, and 
because Congress's amendment of the EAA in 2000 did not 
constitute unconstitutional retroactive legislation, we affirm 
the grant of judgment to the Department.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The statute has ex-
pired but its legislative history is good law.  So say my 
colleagues, in a most curious opinion.

     Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act permits 
federal agencies to withhold documents "specifically exempt-
ed from disclosure by statute."  5 U.S.C. s 552(b)(3).  We 
can all agree that if s 12(c) of the Export Administration Act, 
50 U.S.C. app. s 2411(c), were a law, it would qualify as an 
Exemption 3 "statute."  But the Export Act has expired.  It 
has no more force than the Independent Counsel statute or 
the Sedition Act of 1798.  It simply "no longer exists.  Its life 
is at an end."  Greenwood v. Freight Co., 105 U.S. (15 Otto) 
13, 18 (1881).

     Mere "formalism," a quibble, replies the majority.  The 
Wisconsin Project's reading of Exemption 3 to require a 
"statute," the majority explains, "strangles Congress's in-
tent."  Maj. op. at 12.  In other words, the Export Act may 
be gone, but congressional intent lives on:  Congress at one 
time wanted the Commerce Department to keep the informa-
tion secret, and so it shall remain.  No matter that the 
Freedom of Information Act--a real law--expresses Con-
gress's intent to require a statute exempting the documents 
from disclosure when they are sought or about to be released.  
(The only documents sought were applications filed during a 
time when the Export Act was not in effect.)

     The majority also does a little, a very little, with the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, suggesting 
that it breathes life into the expired confidentiality provision 
of the Export Act.  To qualify for Exemption 3 treatment 
under this theory, the Economic Powers Act must explicitly 
refer to the Export Act, if not its confidentiality provision.  
See Irons & Sears v. Dann, 606 F.2d 1215, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 
1979).  The Economic Powers Act does not even mention the 
Export Act.  Instead, it authorizes the President to "regulate 
... any ... exportation of ... or transactions involving, any 
property in which any foreign country or a national thereof 
has any interest" during a national emergency.  50 U.S.C. 
s 1702(a)(1)(B).  The only indication the Economic Powers 
Act revived the Export Act comes not from its text but, as 
the majority imparts, maj. op. at 10-11, from a Committee 

report.  The trouble is the Committee report does not men-
tion keeping the expired Export Act alive;  it talks only about 
preserving regulations the Commerce Department issued.  
Regulations are not statutes, under the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, or otherwise.  More than that, the Committee 
report does not even refer to the Export Act's confidentiality 
provision.  The Economic Powers Act, which does not itself 
exempt anything from disclosure, thus flatly fails to qualify as 
an Exemption 3 "statute."  See Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders 
v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2002).

     The majority must realize the problem, so it asserts that an 
Executive Order "continued precisely" the Export Act's confi-
dentiality provision.  Maj. op. at 13.  It never occurred to me, 
or to the Framers of the Constitution, that the Executive 
could by the stroke of a pen convert expired legislation into 
an existing statute.  Besides, no Executive Order of any sort 
can satisfy Exemption 3, even if it tracks the language of 
expired legislation.  See Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders, 309 
F.3d at 38.  An Executive Order is not a statute.  See INS v. 
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 945-46 (1983).

     Congress amended Exemption 3 in the wake of FAA v. 
Robertson, 422 U.S. 255 (1975), to restrict the Executive's 
discretion to withhold information;  it required, as a condition 
for nondisclosure, an explicit nondisclosure statute.  See Am. 
Jewish Cong. v. Kreps, 574 F.2d 624, 628-29, 631 (D.C. Cir. 
1978).  There is no such statute here.  In the end all the 
majority can come up with is some free-floating congressional 
intent about the meaning of a statute that no longer exists.  
Alice once encountered a comparable phenomenon:  " 'Well!  
I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;  'but a 
grin without a cat!  It's the most curious thing I ever saw in 
all my life!' "  Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 69 (1946).  
I therefore respectfully dissent.
