     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  The complicated procedural his-
tory of these consolidated appeals from the district court 
masks the simplicity of the three issues presented.  In light 
of the complexities, a summary of these issues would serve no 
useful purpose at this point.  We will begin instead with an 
abbreviated account of how the cases reached this court.

                                I.

     More than a decade ago, the Environmental Protection 
Agency designated St. Louis, Missouri a "nonattainment" 
area of "moderate" classification for ozone.  See 56 Fed. Reg. 
56,694, 56,751, 56,788 (Nov. 6, 1991) (codified at 40 C.F.R. 
ss 81.314, 81.326).  As a consequence of EPA's designation, 
Missouri and Illinois had to revise their state implementation 
plans to attain the primary standard for ozone, 42 U.S.C. 
s 7511a(a);  the time for attainment became November 15, 
1996, see 42 U.S.C. s 7511(a)(1) tbl.1;  and EPA had to 
determine, within six months of the attainment date (by about 
May 15, 1997), whether St. Louis had reached the primary 
standard.  See 42 U.S.C. s 7511(b)(2)(A).  If St. Louis were 
not in attainment, the Clean Air Act directed EPA to reclassi-
fy the area--to the "serious" level, or a higher level applicable 
to the area's "design value" (as calculated by EPA using 
readings from the area)--and to publish a notice of nonattain-

ment in the Federal Register within the same six month 
window.  See id. s 7511(b)(2)(A)(i)-(ii) & (B).

     The higher an area's nonattainment classification, the more 
stringent and numerous are the requirements placed upon the 
States to take action to improve the region's air quality.  See 
generally 42 U.S.C. s 7511a.  If, for instance, St. Louis's 
classification were at the "serious" level, Illinois and Missouri 
would have to implement an "enhanced" vehicle inspection 
and maintenance program to reduce hydrocarbon and nitro-
gen oxide emissions from motor vehicles.  See 42 U.S.C. 
s 7511a(c)(3).

     In November 1998, after giving EPA notice, the Sierra 
Club filed a complaint, invoking the Act's citizen-suit provi-
sion.  42 U.S.C. s 7604(a)(2).  The complaint alleged that 
EPA had not performed its nondiscretionary duty to publish 
a timely notice of nonattainment in the Federal Register and 
a notice of the reclassification of St. Louis's ozone status.  
The argument was in the alternative:  either EPA had made a 
determination of nonattainment and failed to publish it, or 
EPA had not made a determination although the Act required 
it to do so.  EPA admitted that it had not made the required 
determination.  After permitting the States of Missouri and 
Illinois and several associations to intervene as defendants, 
the court ordered EPA to make a determination of St. Louis's 
ozone air quality attainment status by March 12, 2001, and to 
publish any required notices in the Federal Register by 
March 20, 2001.  Sierra Club v. Browner, 130 F. Supp. 2d 78, 
95 (D.D.C. 2001) (amended by order on Feb. 14, 2001).  The 
court refused to order EPA to make its determination retro-
active, as the Sierra Club had urged, and it rejected the 
argument that the EPA had already made the attainment 
determination, as the Sierra Club also argued.  See id. at 90-
94.

     On March 19, 2001, EPA published a notice of its determi-
nation that the St. Louis area had failed to attain the primary 
ozone standard by November 15, 1996, and that reclassifica-
tion by operation of law to the "serious" category would occur 
on the effective date of the rule, May 18, 2001.  See 66 Fed. 

Reg. 15,578.  On the same day, EPA proposed another rule 
that would delay the effective date of the March 19 determi-
nation until June 29, 2001.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 15,591.  Shortly 
thereafter, EPA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to 
extend the attainment date until November 15, 2004, and to 
withdraw the March 19, 2001, reclassification and nonattain-
ment determinations.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 17,647 (Apr. 3, 2001).  
The Sierra Club petitioned this court for a writ of prohibition 
on the proposed rules, which we denied.  See In re Sierra 
Club, No. 01-1141, 2001 WL 799956, at *1 (D.C. Cir. June 8, 
2001).  After EPA finalized these proposed rules, see 66 Fed. 
Reg. 27,036 (May 16, 2001) & 66 Fed. Reg. 33,996 (June 26, 
2001), the Sierra Club petitioned for judicial review in the 
Seventh Circuit of the two rulemakings;  its petitions are still 
pending.  The Sierra Club also filed a motion in the district 
court to enforce the court's judgment, claiming that EPA's 
rulemakings regarding St. Louis's attainment status and its 
time limits violated the order.  The district court denied the 
motion.  We consolidated the Sierra Club's appeal from the 
denial of its motion with its appeal from the district court's 
original order.

                               II.

     The Sierra Club's first argument is that before this lawsuit 
began EPA had already taken final agency action by deter-
mining that St. Louis had failed to attain the required ozone 
standard.  As evidence, it cites several documents, including 
most prominently a March 1998 letter from the EPA Admin-
istrator to the Governor of Missouri discussing St. Louis's air 
quality.  The relevant portion of the letter is as follows:

     In recent years, Missouri has employed a variety of 
     stationary source and fuel regulations which have result-
     ed in improved air quality for the St. Louis area.  While 
     this progress is positive, it has not been sufficient to 
     solve the air quality problem in the area.  As you know, 
     we have been considering whether to reclassify the St. 
     Louis area's nonattainment status from moderate to seri-
     ous.  Recent air quality improvements and Missouri's 
     
     commitments to implement an enhanced vehicle emis-
     sions inspection program, and opt into the Federal refor-
     mulated gasoline (RFG) program, are among the factors 
     being considered.
     
While the Sierra Club thinks this excerpt reflects EPA's final 
determination that St. Louis was not in attainment for ozone, 
the last two sentences indicate otherwise.  Besides, EPA has 
maintained throughout this litigation that it makes nonattain-
ment determinations and reclassifications simultaneously and 
only through rulemaking.  The Sierra Club counters that 
under the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure 
Act the agency must proceed by adjudication rather than 
rulemaking, despite the fact that the Clean Air Act requires 
EPA determinations to be published in the Federal Register.  
42 U.S.C. s 7511(b)(2)(B).  This misses the point.  No matter 
what the Sierra Club thinks the Clean Air Act or the APA 
required of EPA, the fact remains that "EPA's established 
practice for making a final decision concerning nonattainment 
and reclassification is to conduct a rulemaking under the 
APA, not to issue a letter, a list, or some other informal 
document."  Brief of Appellee at 28;  see, e.g., 63 Fed. Reg. 
8128 (Feb. 18, 1998) (Dallas-Fort Worth nonattainment deter-
mination);  62 Fed. Reg. 65,025 (Dec. 10, 1997) (Santa Bar-
bara);  62 Fed. Reg. 60,001 (Nov. 6, 1997) (Phoenix).  In other 
words, if there has not been a rulemaking there has not been 
an attainment determination.  More than that, if the Sierra 
Club were right that in this case EPA took the alternative 
route of adjudication, see NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 
U.S. 267, 294 (1974);  Public Util. Dist. No. 1 v. FERC, 272 
F.3d 607, 620 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam), there is no 
explaining the absence of anything to indicate that such an 
adjudication occurred, or when.  Still further, to credit the 
Sierra Club's argument would require us to assume that the 
adjudication took place in secret, without notice to the States 
of Missouri and Illinois, and without their participation, per-
haps in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Constitu-
tion, see generally Henry J. Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 
123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267 (1975), and that EPA then kept the 
determination in its pocket and deprived it of legal effect by 

failing to publish it in the Federal Register.  The scenario 
may not be impossible, but it is surely incredible.  We 
constantly remind agencies to draw only rational inferences.  
Courts must do the same.

     The Sierra Club also argues that EPA made a determina-
tion in a rulemaking.  It points to a 1998 EPA rule listing 
areas that had attained ozone standards;  the rule did not 
include St. Louis on the list.  See 63 Fed. Reg. 31,014, 31,059 
(June 5, 1998).  The focus of the rule was not the St. Louis 
area's attainment status.  The rule instead provided a founda-
tion for EPA's plan to switch from one-hour to eight-hour 
attainment standards.  EPA specifically noted that the pur-
pose of the rule was not to reclassify any areas.  See 63 Fed. 
Reg. 31,017.  Furthermore, the status quo for St. Louis's air 
quality after 1991 was "nonattainment," so the fact that it was 
not included on a list of regions that had attained compliance 
does not, in itself, indicate that EPA had made the statutory 
determination.

     The next issue is whether the district court erred in 
refusing the Sierra Club's request for what it calls "nunc pro 
tunc" relief--that is, to order EPA to date its attainment 
determination May 15, 1997, although it actually made the 
decision pursuant to the court's direction in a rule published 
on March 19, 2001.

     "Nunc pro tunc" is a fancy phrase for backdating.  Trans-
lated as "now for then," Black's Law Dictionary 1097 (7th ed. 
1999), it is an ancient tool of equity designed to give retroac-
tive effect to the order of a court.  See, e.g., Mitchell v. 
Overman, 103 U.S. 62, 65 (1880);  Eppes ex rel. Wayles v. 
Randolph, 6 Va. (2 Call) 125, 180, 186-87 (1799);  Broom's 
Legal Maxims 94 & n.5 (6th Am. ed. 1868).  Courts have not 
been consistent in their use of this power.  See In re Auto-
Train Corp., 810 F.2d 270, 275 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  One line of 
authority holds that the "power to amend ... must not be 
confounded with the power to create" and limits nunc pro 
tunc relief to situations in which a clerical error creates a 
defect in the record that a nunc pro tunc order can relieve.  
See Gagnon v. United States, 193 U.S. 451, 457-59 (1904);  see 

also Gray v. Brignardello, 68 U.S. (1 Wall.) 627, 636 (1863);  
Cent. Laborers' Pension, Welfare & Annuity Funds v. Grif-
fee, 198 F.3d 642, 644 (7th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he only proper 
office of a nunc pro tunc order is to correct a mistake in the 
records;  it cannot be used to rewrite history.").  While this 
formulation appears to predominate, there are other cases 
that speak of nunc pro tunc orders and judgments which 
supply "action[s] that did not occur on the earlier date."  In 
re Auto-Train Corp., 810 F.2d at 275 (citing In re Triangle 
Chems., Inc., 697 F.2d 1280, 1288-89 (5th Cir. 1983)).  On 
several occasions, this court has directed agencies to re-
adjudicate matters retroactive to the date of the initial deter-
mination, often--but not always--invoking the Latin phrase 
in our opinion.  See Ethyl Corp. v. Browner, 67 F.3d 941, 945 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), and cases there cited.

     In any event, what Sierra Club sought--to have the effec-
tive date of EPA's court-ordered determination converted to 
the date the statute envisioned, rather than the actual date of 
EPA's action--was a form of relief the district court quite 
properly rejected.  Court-ordered or not, EPA engaged in 
rulemaking.  We have held that the APA prohibits retroac-
tive rulemaking.  See Georgetown Univ. Hosp. v. Bowen, 821 
F.2d 750, 756-58 & n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1987), aff'd, 488 U.S. 204 
(1988).  The relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act contain 
no language suggesting that Congress intended to give EPA 
the unusual ability to implement rules retroactively.  See 821 
F.2d at 758.  There may be an exception for situations in 
which the "statute prescribes a deadline by which particular 
rules must be in effect" and the "agency misses that dead-
line."  See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 
224-25 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Even then, retroactivi-
ty must be "reasonable," id. (Scalia, J., concurring), and it is 
far from that here.  Although EPA failed to make the nonat-
tainment determination within the statutory time frame, Sier-
ra Club's proposed solution only makes the situation worse.  
Retroactive relief would likely impose large costs on the 
States, which would face fines and suits for not implementing 
air pollution prevention plans in 1997, even though they were 
not on notice at the time.  The district court adhered to the 

limits of its jurisdiction by ordering EPA to perform the 
nondiscretionary function of making an attainment determina-
tion.  See 42 U.S.C. s 7604(a)(2).  Even if it could have gone 
further and ordered the relief the Sierra Club requested, we 
see no basis for concluding that the court should have been 
compelled to take that step.

     The final issue deals with the Sierra Club's motion to 
enforce the district court's judgment through an injunction 
preventing EPA from taking further action on its proposed 
rules to postpone St. Louis's nonattainment date, and to 
withdraw its nonattainment determination and resulting clas-
sification change.

     The district court was well aware of EPA's plans.  The 
agency asked the court to clarify whether its order would 
prevent EPA from engaging in another rulemaking to post-
pone the effective date of its court-ordered determination of 
attainment.  The court ruled that its order did not restrict 
EPA from engaging in such later rulemakings.  By the time 
of the motion to enforce the judgment, there was no doubt 
that EPA had complied with the court's original directive and 
performed its non-discretionary duties.  The objection is that 
once having complied, EPA undid what the order required 
and thereby violated it.  To accept this contention would 
require us to read the court's order as restricting more than 
the court itself intended.  Given the level of respect we owe 
to a district court's decision regarding what its orders forbid 
or require, see United States v. Western Elec. Co., 46 F.3d 
1198, 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1995), and the district court's limited 
jurisdiction in a citizen suit to order only EPA's performance 
of non-discretionary duties, see 42 U.S.C. s 7604(a)(2), we 
cannot say the court's rejection of the Sierra Club's motion 
was in error.

     The Sierra Club takes note of our denial of its motion for a 
writ of prohibition, and our statement that it had "adequate 
means to obtain the relief requested" and could "move before 
the district court for enforcement of the district court's 
January 29, 2001 order."  In re Sierra Club, 2001 WL 799956, 
at *1.  We do not think much can be read into this.  A writ of 

prohibition will not issue unless the applicant has no other 
adequate forum in which to seek relief--adequate in the 
respect of having a forum in which to bring the action, not a 
forum that will rule in the applicant's favor.  See In re Sealed 
Case No. 98-3077, 151 F.3d 1059, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Our 
order also said that the Sierra Club could seek judicial review 
of EPA's final actions regarding the extension of the St. Louis 
attainment area's effective date and withdrawal of its nonat-
tainment classification in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits.  
In re Sierra Club, 2001 WL 799956, at *1.  The Sierra Club is 
now pursuing that avenue of relief.  If it succeeds in having 
the rules vacated, the nonattainment classification rule pro-
mulgated pursuant to the district court's order will presum-
ably stand.

                              * * *

     Accordingly, the order of the district court granting sum-
mary judgment to the Sierra Club but denying nunc pro tunc 
relief, and the court's order denying the Sierra Club's motion 
to enforce the judgment are affirmed.
