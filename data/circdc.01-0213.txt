     Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge 
Williams.

     Williams, Senior Circuit Judge:  Suing in district court, 
Daniel Yesudian recovered a jury verdict against his employ-
er Howard University for breach of contract, and against 
Joseph Parker, his former supervisor at Howard, for retalia-
tion under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. s 3730(h).  The 
jury rejected Yesudian's s 3730(h) claim against Howard.  
The district court granted judgment as a matter of law for 
Parker on the s 3730(h) retaliation claim, Yesudian v. How-
ard University, 946 F. Supp. 31, 37 (D.D.C. 1996), but we 
reversed, Yesudian v. Howard University, 153 F.3d 731 (D.C. 
Cir. 1998).

     On remand, Yesudian renewed a prior claim that Parker 
and (vicariously) Howard should be liable on the retaliation 
claim for the statutory remedies in s 3730(h), including rein-
statement, double backpay, interest, special damages, and 
attorneys' fees.  The district court denied the relief.  It 
reasoned that the jury had found Howard not liable on the 
s 3730(h) retaliation claim, and that Parker was not Yesudi-
an's "employer" for purposes of that statute.

     On appeal Yesudian offers no serious analysis of s 3730(h) 
to support his claim that that section authorizes liability for a 
supervisor as opposed to an employer.  Rather, he claims 
that Parker has forfeited the argument by failing to raise it 
before the district court in the remand proceedings, and by 
not having raised it before this court in the first appeal.  We 
find neither forfeiture argument compelling.  Reaching the 
merits, we affirm.

                             *  *  *

     The contention that Parker failed to raise the argument in 
the remand proceedings is about half right.  Counsel resisted 
Yesudian's claim to s 3730(h) remedies on the ground that 
Parker "was not Plaintiff's employer and, therefore, has no 

power to reinstate him."  Defendants' Memorandum in Oppo-
sition to Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Relief at 8;  see also 
Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion 
for Post-verdict Equitable Relief at 13.

     This formulation presents the statutory issue very impre-
cisely.  It makes no mention of the statute itself--the sole 
source of liability and sole relevant source of the term "em-
ployer."  But the reference to "employer" logically led the 
district court to the statute and thus to the controlling issue.  
Further, whether s 3730(h) covered a mere supervisor at all 
was an issue " 'antecedent to ... and ultimately dispositive of' 
the dispute," United States National Bank of Oregon v. 
Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc., 508 U.S. 
439, 447 (1993) (quoting Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 
73, 77 (1990)), and thus legitimately before the court, id.

     Yesudian also argues that Parker's filing was in any event a 
week late under then-applicable Local Court Rule 108(b), and 
should not have been considered at all.  But the rule states 
only that when such an opposition paper is not timely filed, 
the court "may treat the motion [that it opposes] as con-
ceded."  D.D.C. R. 108(b) (1994) (emphasis added).  Yesudian 
also cites Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b), which says that the court may 
accept late filings "upon motion" and a showing of "excusable 
neglect."  Cf. Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 
U.S. 871, 895-97 (1990).  We think the motion requirement 
could have been deemed satisfied by defendants' "Memoran-
dum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike."  As for 
"excusable neglect," the standard typically deployed comes 
from Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associ-
ates Limited Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993), where the 
Court (construing Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b), whose text is 
substantively similar to Rule 6(b)) held that this "equitable" 
inquiry should rest on

     the danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the 
     delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the 
     reason for the delay, including whether it was within the 
     reasonable control of the movant, and whether the mov-
     ant acted in good faith.
     
Id. at 395;  see also id. at 391-92 (discussing Rule 6(b));  
Sugarbaker v. SSM Health Care, 187 F.3d 853, 855-56 (8th 
Cir. 1999) (applying Pioneer to Rule 6(b)).

     Here, though without a formal finding of excusable neglect, 
the district court simply pointed to the lack of any prejudice 
to plaintiff and to the general preference for resolving cases 
on the merits.  The Court's lead item, lack of prejudice to the 
other side, is fully conceded by plaintiff.  The delay was brief, 
and there is no suggestion that it had a material effect on the 
proceedings.  The remaining factors relate to the explanation 
of the error--here evidently a mistaken reliance on the D.C. 
Superior Court rules in lieu of those for the federal district 
court for the District of Columbia.  Foolish as this may have 
been, there is no suggestion of bad faith.  Further, although 
defense counsel gives no reason for this error, we note that a 
researcher looking in Westlaw under "Local Federal Court 
Rules by State" will indeed be led to the Superior Court rules 
rather than those of the federal district court.  Thus, given 
the great deference we owe district courts in what are 
effectively their "case-management decisions," Maldonado-
Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 583-84 (1st Cir. 
1994), there was no reversible error in the court's decision to 
accept Parker's late filing.  Cf. Hetzel v. Bethlehem Steel 
Corp., 50 F.3d 360, 367 (5th Cir. 1995).

     Yesudian invokes another theory of forfeiture, arguing that 
Parker abandoned the argument by failing to raise it in the 
district court before the first appeal, and then failing to 
present it on that appeal.  See Crocker v. Piedmont Aviation, 
Inc., 49 F.3d 735, 738-41 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  But any forfeiture 
from failure to raise an issue in an initial appeal is far from 
absolute, especially where, as here, the party failing to pres-
ent the issue was the appellee, defending on a field of battle 
defined by the appellant.  Id. at 740-41.  Moreover, the 
"antecedent" and "dispositive" character of the statutory is-
sue, United States National Bank of Oregon, 508 U.S. at 447, 
here too militates against forfeiture.  Cf. Crocker, 49 F.3d at 
741 (reasoning that the possibility that resolving an issue will 
obviate the need for future litigation complexities militates in 

favor of addressing an issue that might be treated as forfeit-
ed).

     Finally, Yesudian argues that the judgment in the first 
appeal assumed that Parker could be liable as an employer, 
and that therefore this conclusion became the "law of the 
case."  But the law of the case doctrine does not apply where 
an issue was not raised before the prior panel and thus was 
not decided by it.  See, e.g., LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 
1389, 1395 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  For an issue not raised, the 
pertinent doctrine (if any) is forfeiture, see Crocker, 49 F.3d 
at 739, discussed above.

     At last we reach the merits.  Section 3730(h) provides as 
follows:

     Any employee who is discharged ... by his or her 
     employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on 
     behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an 
     action under this section ... shall be entitled to all relief 
     necessary to make the employee whole.  Such relief shall 
     include reinstatement with the same seniority status such 
     employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 
     times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, 
     and compensation for any special damages sustained as a 
     result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and 
     reasonable attorneys' fees.
     
31 U.S.C. s 3730(h).

     Section 3730(h) plainly mentions only the "employer" as 
incurring liability, and the word "employer" does not normal-
ly apply to a supervisor in his individual capacity.  Parker did 
not--in his individual capacity--"employ" Yesudian.  Even in 
cases arising under Title VII, which explicitly defines "em-
ployer" as including "any agent of such a person [a person 
engaged in commerce and employing 15 or more persons]," 
see 42 U.S.C. s 2000e(b), we and all other circuits have held 
that the word "employer" does not cover a supervisor in his 
personal capacity.  Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d 1391, 1399 (D.C. 
Cir. 1995);  see also Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 
1313-17 (2d Cir. 1995);  Dici v. Pennsylvania, 91 F.3d 542, 

552 (3d Cir. 1996);  Lissau v. Southern Food Service, Inc., 159 
F.3d 177, 180-81 (4th Cir. 1998);  Harvey v. Blake, 913 F.2d 
226, 227-28 (5th Cir. 1990);  Hiler v. Brown, 177 F.3d 542, 546 
(6th Cir. 1999);  Williams v. Banning, 72 F.3d 552, 553-55 
(7th Cir. 1995);  Smith v. St. Bernards Regional Medical Ctr., 
19 F.3d 1254, 1255 (8th Cir. 1994);  Miller v. Maxwell's 
International, Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587-88 (9th Cir. 1993);  
Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898, 898-901 (10th Cir. 1996);  
Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir. 1991).  
We (and other circuits) have reasoned that the reference to 
an "agent" was simply for the purpose of incorporating 
respondeat superior liability into the statute.  Gary, 59 F.3d 
at 1399;  Miller, 991 F.2d at 587;  Lissau, 159 F.3d at 180.  
As s 3730(h) does not mention an "agent" of the employer as 
possibly liable, the inference of coverage here would be far-
fetched and in flat contradiction of Gary.

     Further, all the s 3730(h) remedies are phrased in manda-
tory language (the employee "shall be entitled," etc.) and yet 
include remedies such as reinstatement, which a mere super-
visor could not possibly grant in his individual capacity.

     Yesudian nonetheless maintains that Parker should be lia-
ble in his official capacity.  But any claim against Parker in 
his official capacity (assuming such a claim to exist in any 
intelligible sense) necessarily merges with the claim against 
Howard.  Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d at 1399.  The jury exculpat-
ed Howard, and thus no judgment directly contradicting that 
finding could properly be entered.  Yet Yesudian offers no 
argument in favor of the change that seemingly would be 
necessary to allow a coherent judgment in his favor against 
Parker in his official capacity--namely a setting aside, as a 
matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, of the jury's verdict in 
favor of Howard on the s 3730(h) claim.
