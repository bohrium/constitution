     Before:  Williams, Sentelle and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Appellants, who are 19 individuals 
and one corporation,1 seek refunds of special District of 
Columbia taxes enacted by the Council of the District of 
Columbia ("D.C. Council") to finance a new convention center.  
They alleged in their complaint that the Mayor exceeded his 
authority under the District of Columbia Self-Government 
and Governmental Reorganization Act2 by collecting the spe-
cial taxes under an expired statute, and that, notwithstanding 
later ratifications of the taxes by the D.C. Council, they were 
deprived of property without procedural due process and just 
compensation.  They also alleged tortious conversion of their 
money.  The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction.  On appeal, appellants contend 
that the district court erred in holding that the District of 
Columbia is a "State" for purposes of the Federal Tax 
Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. s 1341 (1994) ("FTIA"), that the 
FTIA barred their claims under 42 U.S.C. s 1983 (Supp. III 
1997), and that their claims may only be presented in the 
Superior Court of the District of Columbia after exhaustion of 
administrative remedies.

     We need not decide whether the FTIA applies to the 
District of Columbia, nor whether the FTIA bars appellants'

gress has granted exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to 
District of Columbia tax assessments to the District of Co-
lumbia courts, see D.C. Code ss 11-921(a)(3)(B), 11-1201,

lack of subject matter jurisdiction.3

                                I.

     The Washington Convention Center Authority Act of 1994, 
D.C. Law 10-188 (codified as amended at D.C. Code s 9-801 
et seq.) ("1994 Act"), increased certain D.C. income and 
franchise taxes and certain D.C. sales and use taxes on meals, 
beverages, auto rentals, and hotels.  See 1994 Act ss 301-
303.  The special taxes were dedicated to the construction of 
a new convention center in the District of Columbia, see id. 
ss 201(4), 208, and the Act required the Authority Board to 
submit to the Mayor and D.C. Council, within 24 months, a 
report including a financial statement and feasibility analysis 
for the center's construction.  See id. s 206(h).  The 1994 Act 
also included a sunset provision, providing that the special 
taxes would expire after two years if the Authority Board 
failed to submit the report within 24 months, or by Septem-
ber 28, 1996.  See id. s 306(a).

     Weeks prior to the deadline for submission of the report, 
the D.C. Council concluded that it would be necessary to 
extend the submission deadline, and thus extend the statute 
imposing the special taxes.  On October 1, 1996, the D.C. 
Council passed an emergency act, effective September 28, 
1996, extending the submission deadline to 30 months instead 
of 24 months.4  On December 3, 1996, the D.C. Council

from those relied upon by the district court.  See, e.g., United 
States ex rel. Settlemire v. District of Columbia, 198 F.3d 913, 920 
(D.C. Cir. 1999);  see also Securities and Exchange Commission v. 
Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943) (citing Helvering v. Gowran,

passed a second emergency act, extending the submission 
date to 29 months instead of 24 months, until February 28, 
1997.5  On January 8, 1997, the D.C. Council also passed a 
temporary act, effective after Congressional review on April 
25, 1997, extending the submission deadline to February 28, 
1997.6  Then, in June 1998, the D.C. Council passed perma-
nent legislation to repeal, as of February 27, 1997, the 
submission deadline in the temporary act.7  The D.C. Council 
Report of the Committee on Finance and Revenue stated that 
"a repeal of the [sunset] provision would remove any concerns 
that the continued collection of the taxes is contingent upon 
factual determinations and conditions precedent."  Report of 
D.C. Committee on Finance and Revenue, dated June 1, 
1998, at 9.  Finally, in December 1998, the D.C. Council 
passed permanent legislation that stated "[n]othwithstanding 
any other law, surtaxes and dedicated taxes shall be collected 
by the Mayor," for the convention center, until the tax 
provisions "are repealed by legislation enacted after Septem-
ber 27, 1996."8  This legislation, effective after congressional 
review on April 20, 1999, states that it applies as of Septem-
ber 27, 1996.

effective September 27, 1996, s 21 (codified at D.C. Code s 9-833) 
("1999 Act").

     The 1999 Act would appear to foreclose any argument that 
the D.C. Council did not retroactively authorize the special 
taxes.9  See generally United States v. Heinszen, 206 U.S. 
370 (1907);  Thomas v. Network Solutions, Inc., 176 F.3d 500, 
506 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  According to appellants' complaint, 
however, the special tax laws expired "during all or portions 
of the period from September 28, 1996 until August 12, 1998," 
yet the Mayor continued to collect, and appellants continued 
to pay, the special taxes in an amount of not less than 
$467.06.10  It is this amount, and similar amounts on behalf of 
the class of similarly situated taxpayers, for which appellants 
seek refunds.  The Mayor's collection of the special taxes 
after the statute had expired is the basis for appellants' 
allegation that the Mayor acted ultra vires, beyond his au-
thority under the Self-Government Act.  Appellants maintain 
that the temporary act and the 1998 Act should not be 
interpreted to have retroactive application, and that to the 
extent the 1999 Act is intended to have blanket retroactive 
effect, it is an unconstitutional taking of property without just 
compensation if administrative remedies cannot reasonably be 
pursued.  Appellants further allege that because taxation is 
planned and systematic, not random, any reliance by the 
District of Columbia on post-collection ratification, rather 
than prior legislative action, violates the due process clause, 
citing Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 127-30, 135-39 

__________
     9  See id.

     10  Appellants allege in their complaint that the taxes expired on 
February 28, 1997, because financial submission requirements were 
not met by the date specified in the temporary act.  Alternatively, 
appellants allege that the taxes expired on December 6, 1997, due to 
the expiration of the temporary act on that date.  Appellants also 
allege that because the first emergency act expired on December 
30, 1996, and the second emergency act did not become effective 
until January 8, 1997, taxing authority expired from December 30, 
1996 to January 8, 1997.  Appellants also allege that the taxes 
expired from December 30, 1996 to April 25, 1997, because the 
second emergency act was invalid.  Additionally, appellants allege 
that the taxes expired from September 28, 1996 to April 25, 1997, 
because the first emergency act was invalid.

(1990).  In addition, appellants allege the tortious conversion 
of their money.  They filed their complaint in the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia, asserting 
that the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 
ss 1331, 1343(a)(3), (4), and 1367.

     In granting the motion of the Washington Convention 
Center Authority and the District of Columbia to dismiss the 
complaint, the district court ruled that the District of Colum-
bia was a "State" for purposes of the FTIA, 28 U.S.C. s 1341 
(1994), and hence the FTIA barred appellants' constitutional 
claims under s 1983 because appellants had an adequate 
remedy under District of Columbia law that they had not 
exhausted.11  Because appellants did not seek a declaratory 
judgment or an order enjoining continued collection of the 
taxes, the district court ruled that it could not exercise 
jurisdiction under the "multiplicity of suits" rationale.  Re-
garding appellants' statutory and tort claims under District of 
Columbia law, the district court ruled that, in view of its lack 
of subject matter jurisdiction over appellants' s 1983 claims, 
it was precluded from exercising supplemental jurisdiction.

                               II.

     On appeal, appellants contend that the district court erred 
as a matter of law in holding that the District of Columbia is 
a "State" under the FTIA and in dismissing their claims 
under s 1983 pursuant to the FTIA.  Appellants also contend 
that they were not required to exhaust their remedies under 
District of Columbia law, and, alternatively, if exhaustion is 
required, the administrative remedies were inadequate and 

__________
     11  The Federal Tax Injunction Act provides that:

     The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the 
     assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where 
     a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the courts 
     of such State.
     
28 U.S.C. s 1341 (1994).

exhaustion of them would be futile.  In this regard, appellants 
maintain that because the money was taken from members of 
the class in countless daily transactions, each involving small 
amounts of money, it would be unreasonable to require them 
to keep records of each transaction in order to obtain relief 
under administrative tax refund remedies, see D.C. Code 
ss 47-1812.11(a)(2), 47-2020 (1981), and that because the 
District of Columbia's position throughout this lawsuit has 
been adverse to their claims in every important respect, 
pursuing administrative remedies under District of Columbia 
law would be futile.

     In contending that the district court had subject matter 
jurisdiction of their complaint, appellants rely on D.C. Transit 
System, Inc. v. Pearson, 250 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  They 
read that case to stand for the proposition that where antici-
patory relief is not sought (and appellants do not seek to 
enjoin current or future assessment or collection of the 
special taxes) a suit in district court is not barred by the D.C. 
Tax Injunction Act, D.C. Code s 47-3307 (1981).12  In Pear-
son, the court held that in view of adequate remedies under 
District of Columbia law, a suit to enjoin collection of a 
District of Columbia tax would not lie in the district court.  
250 F.2d at 765.  Our review of appellants' jurisdictional 
contention is de novo.  See Zappia Middle East Construction 
Co. Ltd. v. Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 249 (2nd Cir. 
2000);  Trauma Service Group v. United States, 104 F.3d 
1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Because Congress has vested 
exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia courts over 
all challenges to assessments and claims for refunds of Dis-
trict of Columbia taxes, we hold that the district court lacked 
jurisdiction of appellants' complaint, and we do not reach 
appellants' contentions regarding the FTIA and the D.C. Tax 
Injunction Act.

                                A.

     For many years the courts of the District of Columbia were 
courts of limited jurisdiction and a variety of matters arising 
under District of Columbia law were litigated in the federal 
courts of the District of Columbia.  Congress changed that in 
the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Proce-
dure Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473, (July 29, 1970) 
(codified at D.C. Code s 11-101 et seq. (1981)) ("Court Re-
form Act").  Acting pursuant to Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 
of the United States Constitution, Congress established a 
state-type court system for the District of Columbia and 
transferred jurisdiction over matters arising under District of 
Columbia law from the federal courts to the new District of 
Columbia courts.  See Court Reform Act, Title I, s 111 
(codified at D.C. Code ss 11-921 through 11-923 (1981));  see 
also Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 392 n.2 (1973);  
cf. Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938, 962 n.35 (D.C. Cir. 
1973).  As a result, the District of Columbia courts ceased to 
be courts of limited jurisdiction, and the federal courts in the 
District of Columbia assumed the traditional role of the 
federal courts in our judicial system.  See Andrade v. Jack-
son, 401 A.2d 990, 992 (D.C. 1979);  Reichman v. Franklin 
Simon Corp., 392 A.2d 9, 12 (D.C. 1978).

     Section 111 of the Court Reform Act provided that the 
newly established Superior Court of the District of Columbia 
would have jurisdiction of "any civil action or other matter, at 
law or in equity, which involves an appeal from or petition for 
review of any assessment of tax (or civil penalty thereon) 
made by the District of Columbia."  Court Reform Act, Title 
I, s 111 (codified as D.C. Code s 11-921(a)(3)(B) (1981)).  
Further, s 111 provided that "[t]he Tax Division of the 
Superior Court shall be assigned exclusive jurisdiction of all 
appeals from and petitions for review of assessments of tax 
(and civil penalties thereon) made by the District of Columbia 
and all proceedings brought by the District of Columbia for 
the imposition of criminal penalties pursuant to the provisions 
of the statutes relating to taxes levied by or in behalf of the 
District of Columbia."  Id. (codified as D.C. Code s 11-1201 
(1981)).  Section 111 also provided:

     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the jurisdic-
     tion of the Tax Division of the Superior Court to review 
     the validity and amount of all assessments of tax made 
     by the District of Columbia is exclusive.  Effective on 
     and after the effective date of the [Court Reform Act], 
     any common-law remedy with respect to assessments of 
     tax in the District of Columbia and any equitable action 
     to enjoin such assessments available in a court other than 
     the former District of Columbia Tax Court is abolished.  
     Actions properly filed before the effective date of that 
     Act are not affected by this section and the court in 
     which any such action has been filed may retain jurisdic-
     tion until its disposition.
     
Id. (codified as D.C. Code s 11-1202 (1981)).

     Congress' intent in the Court Reform Act could not be 
more clear:  Congress unambiguously intended to vest in the 
District of Columbia courts exclusive jurisdiction over all 
challenges to District of Columbia taxes including those in-
volving federal statutory or constitutional claims in lieu of 
(rather than concurrently with) jurisdiction in the federal 
courts.  Lest there be any doubt about Congress' intent to 
place exclusive jurisdiction in the newly established District 
of Columbia courts, in the Court Reform Act Congress ex-
pressly repealed its earlier enactment vesting concurrent 
jurisdiction over matters relating to District of Columbia 
taxes in the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia.

     Prior to the Court Reform Act, the district court for the 
District of Columbia was vested with "a two-fold jurisdiction," 
King v. Wall & Beaver Street Corp., 145 F.2d 377, 380 (D.C. 
Cir. 1944), as "both a federal district court and the local trial 
court of general jurisdiction."  Fehlhaber Pile Co. v. Tennes-
see Valley Authority, 155 F.2d 864, 865 (D.C. Cir. 1946);  see 
also W. Urn Mfg. Co. v. Am. Pipe and Steel Corp., 284 F.2d 
279, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1960);  D.C. Code ss 11-301, 11-305, 
11-306 (1940).  In 1952, Congress enacted legislation with a 
"savings clause," S. Rep. No. 82-1471, at 3 (1952);  H.R. Rep. 
No. 82-1977, at 4 (1952), preserving the availability of judicial 
remedies in the federal court for those District of Columbia 

taxpayers who elected not to pursue an administrative refund 
process that was available under District of Columbia law.  
See Act of July 10, 1952, ch. 649, 66 Stat. 543, 546 (codified at 
D.C. Code s 47-2413(c) (1961)).13  Because the district court 
for the District of Columbia at the time was the local trial 
court of general jurisdiction, the 1952 statute had the effect of 
vesting concurrent jurisdiction in the district court over ac-
tions seeking refunds of District of Columbia taxes, along 
with the administrative jurisdiction of the District of Colum-
bia Board of Tax Appeals.  See, e.g., Pearson, 250 F.2d at 
765.  Section 111 of Title I of the Court Reform Act repealed 
the 1952 statute.  See D.C. Code s 11-1202 (1981) (repealing 
D.C. Code s 47-2413(c) (1961)).  Consequently, appellants' 
reliance on Pearson, 250 F.2d at 765, for the proposition that 
the district court had jurisdiction, is misplaced.

     Congress also made clear that its grant of exclusive juris-
diction over challenges to tax assessments under District of 
Columbia law included claims for refunds.  Section 161 of the 
Court Reform Act established an administrative procedure 
for obtaining refunds of District of Columbia taxes, see Court 
Reform Act, Title I, s 161(a)(7) (codified as amended at D.C. 
Code s 47-3310 (1981)), and provided an appeal from an 
administrative determination with de novo review in the D.C. 
Superior Court, see id. s 161(a)(3) (codified as amended at 
D.C. Code s 47-3303 (1981)), a right of appeal to the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals, see id. s 161(a)(4) (codified as 
amended at D.C. Code s 47-3304 (1981)), and certiorari re-

D.C. Code s 11-102 (1981).

     Having established a state-type court system for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, three years later Congress enacted the 
District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Re-
organization Act, Pub. L. No. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774 (December 
24, 1973) (codified at D.C. Code s 1-201 et seq. (1981)) ("Self-
Government Act").  In addition to transferring certain func-
tions previously performed by federal agencies to the District 
of Columbia government, Congress delegated some of its 
legislative authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of 
the United States Constitution to a new District of Columbia 
government.  Title IV of the Self-Government Act was a 
Charter, which set forth the three branches of the District of 
Columbia government and is similar, in some measure, to a 
state constitution.  See Shook v. D.C. Fin. Responsibility and 
Mgmt. Assistance Auth., 132 F.3d 775, 776 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  
Therein Congress delegated to the D.C. Council certain legis-
lative powers, including revenue raising powers, see D.C. 
Code ss 1-227, 1-233 (1981), by means of legislation in the 
form of either permanent, temporary, or emergency acts, as 
appropriate.  See id. ss 1-229, 1-233 (1981);  see also United 
States v. Alston, 580 A.2d 587, 590-91 (D.C. 1990).  The 
Mayor, in turn, was charged with the responsibility to enforce 
the laws, including the levying and collection of taxes.  See 
D.C. Code ss 47-301, 47-310(6) (1981).  Pursuant to their 
delegated authority, the D.C. Council enacted the 1994, 1998, 
and 1999 Acts, and the emergency and temporary acts, and 
the Mayor collected the special taxes for which appellants 
seek refunds.

     By enactment of the Court Reform Act and the Self-
Government Act, therefore, Congress has expressed its clear 
intent to grant exclusive jurisdiction over claims for refunds 
of District of Columbia taxes to the District of Columbia 
courts and authorized District of Columbia government offi-
cials to enact and collect, as well as refund, taxes.  Congress 
divested the federal courts of any jurisdiction over such 
challenges that they might otherwise have, including jurisdic-
tion over challenges presenting federal statutory or constitu-

tional claims.  See Block v. District of Columbia, 492 F.2d 
646, 648 (D.C. Cir. 1974);  District of Columbia v. Berenter, 
466 F.2d 367, 373 n.9, 376 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1972);  H.R. Rep. 
No. 91-907, at 165 (1970).  The lack of life tenure and of the 
other attributes of Article III status on the part of the judges 
of the District of Columbia's courts does not render the 
exclusive jurisdiction of those courts over federal statutory 
and constitutional claims constitutionally problematic.  See 
Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 382-83 (1977).  As would be 
true of a litigant challenging State taxes, the refund and 
appeal procedures in the Court Reform Act do not preclude a 
litigant, including appellants, from raising federal statutory 
and constitutional claims in the District of Columbia courts, 
with ultimate review of federal claims by the United States 
Supreme Court available by writ of certiorari.  See Court 
Reform Act, Title I, s 161(a)(7) (codified as amended at D.C. 
Code s 47-3310 (1981));  id. s 161(a)(3) (codified as amended 
at D.C. Code s 47-3303 (1981));  id. s 161(a)(4) (codified as 
amended at D.C. Code s 47-3304 (1981));  see also D.C. Code 
s 11-102 (1981).

     Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of appellants' com-
plaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.14

     14  In view of our disposition, we do not address appellants' 
contention that administrative remedies under District of Columbia 
law are inadequate and that pursuit of them would be futile.  We 
note that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarily 
affirmed dismissal of a similar complaint brought by appellants for 
failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  See Jenkins v. Wash. 
Convention Ctr. Auth., Nos. 00-CV-29 and 00-CV-239 (D.C. Au-
gust 7, 2000).  Further, it appears that on September 27, 1999, 
appellants filed administrative claims for refunds.  See Washington 
Convention Center Authority's Brief at 19;  Appellants' Reply Brief 
at 7 n.4.
