                            Appellant

          Appeal from the United States District Court 
                  for the District of Columbia 
                        (No. 90cr00449-03)

     A. J. Kramer, Federal Public Defender, appointed by the 
court, argued the cause and filed the briefs as amicus curiae 
on the side of appellant.

     Carlos Saro, appearing pro se, was on the briefs for 
appellant.

     Matthew E. Sloan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued the 
cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Wilma A. 
Lewis, U.S. Attorney at the time the brief was filed, and John 
R. Fisher, Roy W. McLeese, III, Robert D. Okun and John P. 
Dominguez, Assistant U.S. Attorneys.  Mary-Patrice Brown, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney, entered an appearance.

     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Rogers and Garland, 
Circuit Judges.

      Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Carlos Saro seeks relief from the 
district court's denial of his motion for leave to file a motion 
to vacate his sentence.  Although the procedural complexities 
of this case require some discussion, we conclude that the 
district court was plainly correct in ruling that Saro's motion 
was time-barred.   We therefore cannot grant Saro's request 
for relief.

                                I

     In May 1991, Saro was convicted in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia on five counts of 
distribution of and conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, and 
was sentenced to life imprisonment.  In 1994, we denied his 
appeal and affirmed his convictions and sentence.  United 
States v. Saro, 24 F.3d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Saro did not 
seek certiorari from the Supreme Court.

     Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 2255, a federal prisoner may move 
the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct his 
sentence "upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in 
violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or 
that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sen-
tence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum 
authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral at-
tack."  Effective April 24, 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effec-
tive Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) amended s 2255 to impose 
a "1-year period of limitation" on motions brought under that 
section.  Pub. L. No. 104-132, s 105, 110 Stat. 1214, 1220 
(1996).  In United States v. Cicero, we held that prisoners 
like Saro, whose convictions became final before AEDPA's 

effective date, had a one-year grace period from that date in 
which to file a s 2255 motion--yielding a filing deadline of 
April 24, 1997.  See 214 F.3d 199, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

     On August 27, 1997--four months after that deadline--Saro 
mailed a pro se pleading to the district court entitled "Motion 
for Leave to File a Title 28 U.S.C. s 2255."  He did not 
attach a substantive s 2255 motion to this pleading, nor did 
he give any indication of the nature of his underlying claims.  
Instead, Saro sought an extension of time in which to file a 
s 2255 motion, based on the defalcation of his attorney.  Saro 
stated that in late 1996 or early 1997, he contacted attorney 
Patrick L. Brown about filing a motion on his behalf.  Ac-
cording to Saro's pleadings and attached correspondence, 
Brown told him that the deadline for filing the motion was 
April 24, 1997, and that Brown would not start working on 
the motion until Saro paid him a retainer.  Brown wrote Saro 
on March 24, 1997, saying that he had not yet received the 
agreed-upon fee and advising Saro to send it quickly in light 
of the impending deadline.  Saro mailed Brown a payment on 
March 28, 1997.  Saro never heard from Brown again, and by 
May 30, 1997, Saro confirmed through correspondence with 
the clerk of the district court that Brown had not filed the 
s 2255 motion.  On July 31, 1997, Saro filed a complaint with 
the Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the 
bar of which Brown was a member.  See Mot. for Leave to 
File at 1-2, Ex. 2.1

     On April 30, 1998, the district court denied Saro's motion 
for leave to file on the ground that it was "time-barred 
because it was filed significantly more than a year after the 
enactment of the AEDPA."  United States v. Saro, No. 
90-cr-449, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Apr. 30, 1998) ("April 1998 
Order").  In response to Saro's argument that the limitations 
period should be tolled because of his lawyer's malfeasance, 
the court concluded that there were "no 'extraordinary cir-
cumstances' ... which would justify equitable tolling."  Id.  
The court explained that although Saro had learned of 
Brown's failure to file by May 30, 1997, he did not submit his

motion for leave to file until three months later.  Moreover, 
Saro offered "no explanation for this three-month delay."  Id.

     Saro responded to the court's order with a series of mo-
tions seeking reconsideration, all of which the court denied.  
Saro subsequently asked the district court to issue a Certifi-
cate of Appealability (COA), required by 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c) 
to appeal "the final order in a proceeding under section 2255."  
The district court denied this request as well.  Saro filed 
notices of appeal from one of the district court's denials of 
reconsideration and from its denial of a COA.2  We consoli-
dated the notices of appeal and appointed the Federal Public 
Defender as amicus curiae to present arguments on Saro's 
behalf.3

                                II

     As amended by AEDPA in 1996, 28 U.S.C. s 2253 states:  
"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of 

__________
     2 Although there might otherwise be questions concerning the 
timeliness of these notices of appeal, the United States agrees that 
both were timely filed, as was the application to the district court 
for a COA, because none of the orders entered by the district court 
complied with the "separate document" requirement of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 58.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 (providing that 
"[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document," and 
that a "judgment is effective only when so set forth");  United 
States v. Feuver, 236 F.3d 725, 727-28 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (noting 
government's concession that Rule 58 applies to s 2255 proceed-
ings);  Kidd v. District of Columbia, 206 F.3d 35, 39-40 (D.C. Cir. 
2000) (discussing standard for satisfying requirements of Rule 58).  
While the time limit for filing a notice of appeal does not begin to 
run until the district court files a judgment that conforms with Rule 
58, this court has jurisdiction to decide an appeal filed before entry 
of a conforming judgment.  See Pack v. Burns Int'l Sec. Serv., 130 
F.3d 1071, 1072-73 (D.C. Cir. 1997).

     3 Both parties agree that resolution of the issues raised by the 
notice of appeal from the district court's denial of a COA will 
resolve this case in its entirety.  Hence, we need not delve into the 
procedural problems surrounding Saro's appeal from the court's 
earlier denial of reconsideration.

appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of 
appeals from ... the final order in a proceeding under section 
2255."  28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1);  see Pub. L. No. 104-132, 
s 102, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217 (1996).  When a COA is required, 
we treat a notice of appeal as an application for a COA.  See 
United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 
2000);  see also Fed. R. App. P. 22(b);  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 
U.S. 473, 483 (2000).  Although Saro applied for a COA in the 
district court, he now contends that no COA is required to 
hear his appeal because the district court's April 1998 deci-
sion was not "the final order in a proceeding under section 
2255," but rather was merely the denial of leave to file a 
s 2255 motion.  The United States contends that a COA is 
required because that decision was in fact the final order in a 
s 2255 proceeding.

     If a COA is required, it is a prerequisite to our consider-
ation of Saro's appeal.  See 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c);  Slack, 529 
U.S. at 485.  Thus, we may not simply assume that a COA is 
not required and proceed to the merits of Saro's claim.  Cf. 
Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 93-94 
(1998) (holding that federal courts must determine that they 
have jurisdiction before turning to the merits of a case).  We 
may, however, assume that a COA is required, and then 
proceed to consider whether Saro can satisfy the require-
ments for issuance of a COA.  Cf. Slack, 529 U.S. at 485 
(holding that "[e]ach component of the s 2253(c) showing is 
part of a threshold inquiry");  Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil 
Co., 526 U.S. 574, 584-85 (1999) (holding that jurisdictional 
questions may be resolved in any order).  Whether such an 
approach is fair to Saro if in fact no COA is required for his 
appeal is, of course, another question--which we address in 
Part III below.

     Under s 2253, a COA may issue "only if the applicant has 
made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 
right."  28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(2).  In Slack v. McDaniel, the 
Supreme Court held that when a "district court denies a 
habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the 
prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue 
... if the prisoner shows, at least, [1] that jurists of reason 

would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid 
claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and [2] that 
jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district 
court was correct in its procedural ruling."  529 U.S. at 478.  
The Slack test applies to Saro's case, because the district 
court denied Saro's motion solely on the procedural ground 
that it was barred by the statutory deadline.

     The government contends that Saro cannot meet the first 
requirement of the Slack test--a debatable claim of the denial 
of a constitutional right--because Saro has never described 
the nature of his underlying constitutional claim.  In re-
sponse, Saro contends that the requirement of a debatable 
constitutional claim cannot be applied literally in a case like 
his, where the underlying s 2255 motion was never filed 
because the district court denied leave to file.  We need not 
resolve this dispute regarding Slack's first requirement, how-
ever, because it is quite clear that Saro cannot meet Slack's 
second requirement:  that jurists of reason would find it 
debatable whether the district court was correct in its proce-
dural ruling.4

     The government asks us to hold that reasonable jurists 
would not dispute the correctness of the district court's ruling 
that Saro's motion was time-barred, both because equitable 
tolling never applies to proceedings under s 2255, and be-
cause even if the doctrine does apply, malfeasance by a 
prisoner's attorney does not constitute the "extraordinary 
circumstances" necessary to bring the doctrine into play.  See 
Cicero, 214 F.3d at 203 (holding that if equitable tolling 
applies to s 2255, tolling is warranted only "if extrordinary 
circumstances beyond a prisoner's control" prevented him

     4 In Slack, the Supreme Court advised courts of appeals that:  
"Each component of the s 2253(c) showing is part of a threshold 
inquiry, and a court may find that it can dispose of the application 
in a fair and prompt manner if it proceeds first to resolve the issue 
whose answer is more apparent....  The recognition that the 
'Court will not pass upon a constitutional question ... if there is 
also present some other ground upon which the case may be 
disposed of,' ... allows and encourages the court to first resolve 
procedural issues."  529 U.S. at 485 (quoting Ashwander v. TVA, 
297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)).

from filing by the statutory deadline).5  We need not reach 
either such conclusion to resolve this case.  Even if s 2255's 
period of limitations is subject to equitable tolling, and even if 
the malfeasance of Saro's lawyer qualifies for tolling, the 
amount of time tolled would not excuse Saro's three-month 
delay after he learned of his lawyer's failure to file.

     The Supreme Court has explained that "[p]rinciples of 
equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has 
been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later 
event, the time remaining on the clock is calculated by 
subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran 
before the clock was stopped."  United States v. Ibarra, 502 
U.S. 1, 4 n.2 (1991).  Saro's pleadings indicate that he did not 
engage Brown to file the s 2255 motion until, at the earliest, 
March 28, 1997--the date he sent the payment that Brown 
told him was necessary for work to begin.  Accordingly, even 
if Brown's defalcation is the kind of "extraordinary circum-
stance" that warrants tolling, the earliest date upon which 
tolling could begin was March 28--at which point Saro had 
approximately one month remaining before the April 24, 1997 
filing deadline.  Saro's pleadings also make clear that he 
knew Brown had failed to file the s 2255 motion no later than 
May 30, 1997, when Saro received confirmation from the 
district court clerk that no filing had been made.  Thus, May 
30 was the latest date upon which the time bar would begin to 
run again, at which point principles of equitable tolling would 
leave Saro with another month--until the end of June--to 
make his s 2255 filing with the district court.6  Saro, howev-
er, did not file within a month of learning of his lawyer's 

__________
     5 Cicero found it unnecessary to decide whether equitable tolling 
applies to s 2255 proceedings because the circumstances cited by 
the prisoner did not qualify as "extraordinary."  214 F.3d at 203.

     6 See Ibarra, 502 U.S. at 4 n.2 ("[F]or example, a motion to 
reconsider filed after 20 days, if it tolled the 30-day period to 
appeal, would leave at most only 10 days to appeal once the 
reconsideration motion was decided.").  The new deadline may be 

malfeasance.  Instead, he waited three months--until the end 
of August 1997--missing even an equitably extended deadline 
by two months.

     Saro contends that this should not be the end of our 
inquiry, and that we should extend the limitations period 
through the date of his August filing, or at least remand for a 
hearing into the circumstances of this additional delay.  Had 
Saro offered an explanation for the additional delay, he might 
have an argument in this regard.  But it is Saro's burden to 
establish that equitable tolling is warranted,7 and he has 
offered no explanation for his failure to file even a request for 
an extension of time during the three months from May 
through August:  not in his multiple pleadings in the district 
court, and not in any subsequent pleading on appeal.8  As 
noted above, this circuit held in Cicero that if equitable tolling 
applies at all under s 2255, it applies only in "extraordinary 
circumstances."  214 F.3d at 203.  Moreover, the Cicero court 
rejected as insufficiently extraordinary the fact that a prison-
er's preparations for filing during the final months of the 
AEDPA grace period were interrupted when he was stabbed 
and hospitalized, and when his legal papers became unavail-
able because he was transferred to a different prison.  Id. at 

__________
calculated in an equivalent way by tacking the length of the tolled 
period--that is, the period from March 28 to May 30--onto the 
original limitations deadline of April 24, 1997.

     7 See Phillips v. Donnelly, 216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir. 2000) 
(noting that "the party seeking to establish tolling typically carries 
that burden," and applying that rule to equitable tolling under 
AEDPA);  Bayer v. United States Dep't of Treasury, 956 F.2d 330, 
333 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that a Title VII plaintiff bears the 
burden of establishing his entitlement to equitable tolling).

     8 Saro has offered no explanation notwithstanding that the district 
court repeatedly stated that it could not grant relief because Saro 
had failed to explain the three-month delay.  See United States v. 
Saro, No. 90-cr-449, slip op. at 4 n.2 (D.D.C. July 23, 1999);  United 
States v. Saro, No. 90-cr-449, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. June 25, 1998);  
United States v. Saro, No. 90-cr-449, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Apr. 30, 
1998).

201.  It must follow that when a prisoner proffers no reason 
whatsoever for his failure to file by an already-extended 
deadline, additional equitable tolling is plainly unwarranted 
and the district court need conduct no further factfinding on 
the subject.  See generally id. at 204 (declining to remand to 
the district court for additional factfinding).

     In sum, we conclude that the district court was plainly 
correct in holding that there were "no 'extraordinary circum-
stances' ... which would justify equitable tolling" sufficient to 
render Saro's filing timely in this case.  April 1998 Order at 
2.9  Moreover, this result is so clear, particularly in light of 
the absence of any explanation for Saro's failure to file for 
three months after learning of his lawyer's failure to file, that 
"jurists of reason" would not "find it debatable whether the 
district court was correct in its procedural ruling."  Slack, 
529 U.S. at 478.  Accordingly, Saro is ineligible for a COA.  
See id.

                               III

     To this point, our analysis has proceeded upon the assump-
tion that Saro requires a COA in order to appeal the district 

__________
     9 We have examined whether the court was "correct," rather than 
whether it "abused its discretion," because we employ de novo 
review when a district court holds--as the court appears to have 
done here--that the facts cannot justify equitable tolling as a 
matter of law.  See Smith-Haynie v. Dist. of Columbia, 155 F.3d 
575, 578 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (noting that "the doctrine of equitable 
tolling ordinarily involves discretion on the trial judge's part," but 
employing de novo review because the district court found as a 
matter of law that the facts "could not support invocation of the 
equitable tolling doctrine");  see also Dunlap v. United States, No. 
99-6456, 2001 WL 473063, at *5 & n.2 (6th Cir. May 7, 2001) 
(reviewing a district court's s 2255 equitable tolling decision de 
novo, where the district court declined to grant tolling as a matter 
of law).

court's denial of his motion for leave to file a s 2255 motion.  
Saro objects that such an assumption is unfair to him, arguing 
that a COA is only required to appeal from the denial of a 
s 2255 motion, and not from the denial of a motion to file 
such a motion.  Saro's objection to our analytical approach 
would rest on firm ground, and hence require a resolution of 
whether a COA is actually required in this case, if the 
standard for reviewing a COA application were less favorable 
to him than the standard for reviewing an appeal.10  But the 
COA standard is not less favorable, and Saro's objection is 
therefore misplaced.

     Our conclusion that Saro does not qualify for a COA turned 
on the correctness of the district court's ruling that Saro's 
out-of-time filing could not be saved by the doctrine of 
equitable tolling.  But just as that procedural ruling was the 
central issue in our COA analysis, so too would it be were the 
case analyzed as an appeal.  Moreover, the standard for 
reviewing the correctness of that ruling on an application for 
a COA is more favorable to Saro than is the standard for 
reviewing the merits of an appeal.  To qualify for a COA:  
"[T]he petitioner need not show that he should prevail on the 
merits....  Rather, he must demonstrate that the issues are 
debatable among jurists of reason;  that a court could resolve 
the issues [in a different manner];  or that the questions are 
adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further."  
Mitchell, 216 F.3d at 1130 (alterations and emphasis in origi-
nal) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 893 n.4 (1983)).  
As we have held in Part II, Saro cannot meet even this liberal 
standard.  Accordingly, he necessarily would fail on the mer-
its were we to treat his notice as an appeal rather than as an 
application for a COA.

__________
     10 For example, had Saro's COA application foundered upon the 
first of Slack's requirements--that he have a debatably valid claim 
of the denial of a constitutional right--he would have reason to 
complain, because such a requirement would not typically apply on 
appeal from a district court's denial of a motion to file out of time.

                                IV

     For the foregoing reasons, Saro's appeal, treated as an 
application for a COA, is

                                                                 Dismissed.
