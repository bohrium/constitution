     Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge Edwards.

     Edwards, Chief Judge:  Slinger Drainage Inc. ("Slinger") 
seeks review of a final decision of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency's ("EPA's") Environmental Appeals Board.  
Slinger is in the business of installing drainage tile, and in 
this capacity used a Hoes Trenching Machine to install 26,000 
linear feet of drainage tile over a 50-acre area.  As a result, 
the EPA filed an administrative complaint against Slinger 
alleging that Slinger violated s 301(a) of the Clean Water 
Act, 33 U.S.C. s 1311(a) (1994), by failing to secure a permit 
before discharging pollutant into wetland as required under 
s 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. s 1344.  The Admin-
istrative Law Judge found Slinger liable as alleged and 
assessed a Class II civil penalty of $90,000;  the Appeals 
Board affirmed both the finding of liability and the penalty.  
In re:  Slinger Drainage, Inc., CWA Appeal No. 98-10 (Sept. 
29, 1999), reprinted in Joint Appendix 39.  Whatever the 
substance of Slinger's claims, this court has no jurisdiction to 
reach the merits in this case, because Slinger's notice of 
appeal was untimely.

     In the case of an assessment of a Class II civil penalty, a 
party may obtain judicial review "by filing a notice of appeal 
in such court within the 30-day period beginning on the date 
the civil penalty order is issued."  33 U.S.C. s 1319(g)(8)(B).  
The Supreme Court has explained that "[j]udicial review 
provisions ... are jurisdictional in nature and must be con-
strued with strict fidelity to their terms....  This is all the 
more true of statutory provisions specifying the timing of 
review, for those time limits are, as we have often stated, 
'mandatory and jurisdictional,' ... and are not subject to 
equitable tolling."  Stone v. Immigration and Naturalization 
Serv., 514 U.S. 386, 405 (1995) (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 
495 U.S. 33, 45 (1990)).  Under 33 U.S.C. s 1319(g)(8)(B), 
Slinger had 30 days to file its notice of appeal beginning on 
the date the order issued.  As a statutory provision defining 
the timing of review within a judicial review provision, this 
30-day period is jurisdictional.

     The parties disagree on when the Appeals Board issued its 
order.  Slinger asserts that the order issued on Thursday, 
September 30, 1999;  the EPA argues that the order issued 

on Wednesday, September 29, 1999.  For the purpose of 
assessing our jurisdiction, we assume, without deciding, that 
Slinger is correct and the order issued on Thursday, Septem-
ber 30, 1999.  Even accepting this assumption, however, 
Slinger's notice of appeal was not timely.

     33 U.S.C. s 1319(g)(8)(B) specifies that the period for filing 
a notice of appeal runs for 30 days beginning on the day the 
order issues.  This provision does not, however, indicate any 
rules regarding the treatment of weekend days, holidays, or 
other potential exceptions.  As a result, we look to Federal 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(a), which provides that Satur-
days and Sundays are counted within the filing period, unless 
the last day of the period falls on a Saturday or Sunday.  In 
particular, Rule 26(a) directs that we "[i]nclude the last day of 
the period unless it is a Saturday, Sunday [or] legal holiday."  
Under this provision, the court must include intermediate 
Saturdays and Sundays in computing the 30-day period.  
Thus, starting with the date Slinger asserts the order issued, 
Thursday, September 30, 1999, the 30-day period ended on 
Friday, October 29, 1999.  Slinger filed its notice of appeal to 
this court on Monday, November 1, 1999--outside the legal 
time for filing its notice of appeal.

     At oral argument Slinger asserted that Rule 26(a) governs 
how the 30-day period is computed.  Were this the case, we 
would "[e]xclude the day of the act, event, or default that 
begins the period."  Fed. R. App. P. 26(a).  Thus, under Rule 
26(a), we would not include the day the order issued, which 
would mean that the 30th calendar day fell on Saturday, 
October 30, 1999.  Under this calculation, the 30th day for 
filing a notice of appeal would have been Monday, November 
1, 1999, the day that Slinger filed.

     Rule 26(a), however, does not apply when Congress has 
specified a particular method of counting in the statute itself 
and there is no indication of a contrary congressional inten-
tion.  This was evident in United Mine Workers of America 
v. Dole, 870 F.2d 662, 665 (D.C. Cir. 1989), where the court 
found that Rule 26(a) applied to the requirement in the Mine 
Act, 30 U.S.C. s 811(d) (1994), that a petition challenging a 

new standard be filed "prior to the sixtieth day after such 
standard is promulgated."  The court explained that, because 
the cited statute made "no separate provision for the compu-
tation of time," "Congress intended its time periods to be 
computed in accordance with the federal rule."  United Mine 
Workers, 870 F.2d at 665.  The court also noted the "continu-
ing vitality" of the Supreme Court's reasoning in Union 
National Bank v. Lamb, 337 U.S. 38, 40-41(1949), namely, 
"that the federal rules of procedure can be relied on for 
interpreting a statutory time period in the absence of any 
more statute-specific provisions or indication that Congress 
did not intend the rules to apply."  United Mine Workers, 
870 F.2d at 665 n.2.

     In this case, in contrast, the statute currently before us 
clearly establishes a separate provision for the computation of 
time:  a person may obtain review by filing "within the 30-day 
period beginning on the date the civil penalty issued."  33 
U.S.C. s 1319(g)(8)(B) (emphasis added).  And there is noth-
ing to suggest that Congress did not intend precisely what it 
said in the statute.  As a result, Slinger's notice of appeal was 
not timely, and this court has no authority to hear the merits 
of its claim.  We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
