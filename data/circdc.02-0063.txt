                             ORDER

     It is ORDERED, by the Court on its own motion, that the following revisions shall be
made to the opinion decided March 5, 2002, in this case:

     At page 2 of the slip opinion, delete the words "and remand for trial of the copyright
infringement claim" from the sentence beginning "Although differences between the two
embassy designs . . ." (lines 22 28 of the paragraph).

     At page 16 of the slip opinion, delete the words "and remand for trial" from the last
sentence of the first full paragraph.

     At page 30 of the slip opinion, replace the current section VII with the following:

          The motion to dismiss this appeal is denied.  The grant of summary judgment for
     Demetriou and the UAE on Sturdza's copyright claim is reversed.  The Rule
     12(b)(6) dismissal of Counts Five, Six, and Seven (the tort claims) as to
     Demetriou is also reversed.  The Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Sturdza's section
     1985 claim is affirmed.  The question whether D.C. law bars Sturdza's contract
     and quantum meruit claims is certified to the District of Columbia Court of
     Appeals, and all further proceedings in this matter shall be held in abeyance
     pending further order of this court.
