       Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Jeffrey Van Ee, an employee of the 
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), appeals the grant 
of summary judgment to appellees, EPA and the Office of 
Government Ethics ("OGE").  The district court ruled that 
Van Ee could not act as a spokesperson for environmental 
groups of which he has been a long-time member in connec-
tion with such groups' public comments on draft environmen-
tal impact statements and similar land-use plans issued by 
federal agencies other than EPA because doing so would 
violate a criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. s 205, 
under which a federal employee may not act as an agent or 
attorney for a private party in any "particular matter" in 
which the United States has an interest.  See Van Ee v. EPA, 
55 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 1999).  Van Ee contends that EPA 
and the district court have read the statute too broadly, and 
that if they have not, the statute unconstitutionally infringes 
his First Amendment rights of free speech and free associa-
tion.  Alternatively, Van Ee contends that even if the statute 
constitutionally applies, an OGE regulation requiring federal 
government employees to endeavor to avoid the appearance 
of violating s 205, 5 C.F.R. s 2635.101(b)(14) (1999), is uncon-
stitutionally vague as applied.

     We hold that s 205 is inapplicable to Van Ee's uncompen-
sated communications on behalf of public interest groups in 
response to requests by an agency at which he is not em-
ployed for public comment on proposed environmental impact 
statements related to land-use plans;  these proceedings lack 
the particularity required by the statute, will not result in a 
direct material benefit to the public interest groups, and do 
not create a real conflict of interest or entail an abuse of 
position by Van Ee.  Accordingly, we do not reach Van Ee's 
contentions concerning the First Amendment's application to 
s 205 or the appearance regulation, and we reverse the grant 
of summary judgment and remand the case for entry of a 

declaratory judgment in Van Ee's favor in accordance with 
this opinion.

                                I.

     Van Ee is an electrical engineer in the Office of Research 
and Development in the Characterization Research Division 
of the National Exposure Research Laboratory in Las Vegas, 
Nevada.  The laboratory is part of EPA.  Van Ee is a career 
civil service employee, paid at the rate of a grade 13 on the 
General Schedule.  His work entails monitoring contaminants 
in air, water and soil, and recently he has been involved in 
developing and using computer software to characterize haz-
ardous waste sites.

     For more than twenty-five years, Van Ee has lived in the 
Las Vegas area, and during that time he has been an active 
volunteer member of various state and local environmental 
groups, even serving as an officer of the local chapter of 
certain groups.1  The federal government owns more than 85 
percent of the land in Nevada, and consequently Van Ee's 
volunteer work has included contact with various federal 
agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management 
("BLM"), the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest 
Service ("Forest Service"), and the Departments of Energy 
and Defense. Until recent years, Van Ee communicated regu-
larly with these agencies regarding wildlife and public lands 
issues;  none of his communications was related to his respon-
sibilities at EPA.

     After EPA had initiated various disciplinary actions against 
Van Ee and had issued advisory warnings to him concerning 
his representational activities, Van Ee sued EPA and OGE in 
1995 in the district court seeking declaratory and injunctive 
relief.  The complaint alleged that in 1990 EPA reprimanded 
Van Ee for participating in a meeting with the BLM, which 
focused on a proposed land transfer and the appropriate 

__________
     1 These include the Southern Nevada Group of the Toiyabe 
Chapter of the Sierra Club ("Sierra Club");  Nevada Wildlife Feder-
ation ("NWF");  and the Nevada Outdoor Recreation Association 
("NORA") (collectively "the Nevada groups").

treatment of endangered desert tortoises, on the ground that 
under 18 U.S.C. s 205 he had impermissibly acted as an 
"agent" of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in the meet-
ing.  EPA referred the matter to the United States Attor-
ney's Office, which did not prosecute Van Ee.  The complaint 
further alleged that Van Ee was warned that additional 
violations of s 205 could result in disciplinary action, includ-
ing termination of his employment.  Thereafter, through 
counsel, Van Ee sought guidance from EPA on how he might 
continue his volunteer activities without violating s 205.

     As is discussed more fully below, s 205 prohibits a federal 
employee from acting as the "agent or attorney" of a private 
group in relation to a list of proceedings such as an "investi-
gation", "contract", or "other particular matter" in which the 
United States has an interest.  See 18 U.S.C. s 205(a)(2), (h).  
EPA advised Van Ee by letter of May 24, 1994, that he could 
not communicate with federal agencies on behalf of any group 
in an attempt to influence federal policy with respect to any 
"particular matter," which EPA interpreted broadly to in-
clude certain policymaking proceedings such as those in 
which Van Ee sought to participate, and further that Van Ee 
could not communicate on his own behalf in a way that would 
"create the appearance" that he is acting on behalf of another 
in such a matter.  The complaint asserts that s 205 does not 
apply to proceedings in which Van Ee seeks to present the 
views of membership organizations in response to agency 
requests for public comment on land-use and wildlife conser-
vation proposals.  Alternatively, the complaint asserts that 
the statute unconstitutionally denies him his First Amend-
ment rights of free speech and association.  It also challenges 
the OGE regulation as unconstitutionally vague, providing 
virtually no standards to which Van Ee can conform without 
risking the loss of his job.

     After filing his complaint, Van Ee continued to seek guid-
ance from EPA.  In 1996 he requested an advisory opinion 
from EPA, see 5 C.F.R. s 2635.107(b), as to whether certain 
proposed activities and comments he intended to provide on 
behalf of the Nevada groups would subject him to disciplinary 

action either for violating, or appearing to violate, s 205.2  
For example, in response to a proposed environmental impact 
statement, see 42 U.S.C. s 4332(2)(C), issued by BLM con-
cerning its plan for managing public lands in southern Neva-
da, Van Ee sought to provide comments on behalf of the 
Sierra Club related to mining, endangered species, land ex-
change, recreational use, and wilderness designation and 
management.  In response to EPA's request for details, Van 
Ee elaborated that he considered it likely that some of his 
comments would focus on use of specific parcels of land and 
on the siting of power lines by two utility companies, as well 
as BLM's acquisition of environmentally-sensitive lands in 
which a mining company had an interest.

     In its response, by letter of April 5, 1996, EPA advised Van 
Ee that it would consider his communications to be in relation 
to a matter covered by s 205 if the focus were on the 

__________
     2 Van Ee proposed:  (1) to give written and verbal comments on 
behalf of the Sierra Club on a BLM environmental impact state-
ment ("EIS") regarding a plan to manage all public lands in 
Southern Nevada;  (2) to attend meetings with and/or hearings 
before BLM and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concerning a 
proposed habitat plan for the desert tortoise (including meetings to 
which NWF was exclusively invited);  (3) to give written and verbal 
comments on behalf of NORA or the Sierra Club on the Forest 
Service's master plan for the Spring Mountain Recreational Area;  
(4) to give written and verbal comments on behalf of NORA on the 
"scoping phase" of BLM's EIS for the Red Rock National Conser-
vation Area;  (5) to comment on behalf of the Sierra Club on the 
Southern Nevada Water Authority's plans to expand the water 
system feeding Las Vegas;  and (6) to comment for the Sierra Club 
on the siting of a BLM-proposed hydroelectric facility.  Van Ee also 
proposed to request a group camping permit from the Forest 
Service for NWF.  It is unclear whether this last request remains 
at issue because EPA indicated such a request would be permissible 
to the extent that approval of the permit was solely ministerial.  In 
the absence of record evidence that a concrete dispute remains, we 
decline to address whether such a permit request would be prohibit-
ed by s 205, and if it were, whether Van Ee's First Amendment 
rights would be implicated.

interests of discrete and identifiable persons.3  With respect 
to the BLM resource management plan, EPA advised that 
although such a plan itself would "probably not focus[] upon 
the interests of specific persons, or a discrete and identifiable 
class of persons,....  it is possible that an aspect of the Plan 
which Mr. Van Ee wants to discuss would [so] focus ... and 
thus constitute a 'particular matter.' "  With respect to the 
other proposed communications, EPA similarly advised Van 
Ee that these would violate 18 U.S.C. s 205 because they 
would in some way focus on "discrete and identifiable per-
sons" and would therefore relate to a "particular matter" 
covered by the statute.  EPA indicated, however, that Van 
Ee could express his personal views to federal agencies, could 
assist the organizations of which he was a member in prepar-
ing their remarks for presentation to federal agencies, and 
could even respond to press inquiries about the views ex-
pressed by these organizations.  Since receiving this EPA 
advice, Van Ee has significantly reduced his volunteer ap-
pearances and communications with federal agencies, and he 
is no longer an officer of the Sierra Club.

                               II.

     It is EPA's interpretation of the scope of s 205(a)(2) set 
forth in its letter of April 5, 1996, that continues to cause Van 
Ee to refrain from engaging in certain communications as a 
spokesperson for the Nevada groups and that Van Ee chal-
lenges now.  Van Ee sought a broad declaration from the 
district court that he had the right to communicate with 
federal agencies on behalf of the Nevada groups with respect 
to any issue unrelated to his work at EPA, see Van Ee, 55 
F.Supp.2d at 4, but the issue before this court is limited to 
whether Van Ee may represent the Nevada groups in the 
types of administrative settings addressed in EPA's April 

__________
     3 Noting that no regulations had been promulgated to interpret 
s 205, EPA purported to rely for its advice to Van Ee on 5 C.F.R. 
s 2635.402(b)(3), an OGE regulation interpreting "particular mat-
ter" as used in 18 U.S.C. s 208, a related conflict-of-interest provi-
sion prohibiting federal employees from participating in matters in 
which they have a financial interest.

1996 advisory letter.4  Consequently, the issue on appeal is 
whether Congress intended s 205 to prohibit, on penalty of 
fine or imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. s 216, a career federal 
employee from presenting the views of citizens' groups of 
which the employee is a member, without receiving compen-
sation, in response to requests for public comment on pro-
posed land-use plans issued by federal agencies other than 
the employing agency.  See supra n.[2]. Interpreting the 
scope of matters covered by s 205(a)(2) is an issue of first 
impression in this circuit.

     EPA implicitly determined in its 1996 advisory opinion that 
none of the specific terms in s 205(h) covered the public 
comment phase on a federal agency's environmental impact 
statement, as required by the National Environmental Policy 
Act, 42 U.S.C. s 4332(2)(C) (1994);  40 C.F.R. s 1503.1(4) 
(1999).  Nonetheless, EPA, and subsequently the district 
court, concluded that s 205's catchall phrase, "other particu-
lar matter," covered commentary on such EIS-related mat-
ters and similar federal land-use proposals.  See Van Ee, 55 
F.Supp.2d at 6-7.  Our review of the district court's ruling on 
summary judgment is de novo. Independent Bankers Ass'n of 
Am. v. Farm Credit Admin., 164 F.3d 161, 166 (D.C. Cir. 
1999);  Tao v. Freeh, 27 F.3d 635, 638 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

__________
     4 Although Van Ee urges this court to hold broadly that s 205 
does not bar "federal employees ... from speaking on behalf of 
others to federal agencies in connection with issues of public 
concern outside the context of legal or administrative claims or 
proceedings or formal, adversarial legal relationships such as con-
tracts," the examples in his letter giving rise to EPA's response of 
April 5, 1996, are more confined.  See supra n.2. The broadly 
phrased relief sought by Van Ee encompasses a variety of types of 
communications, many of which he may have no interest in pursuing 
and some of which may fall within s 205 and thus require consider-
ation of his First Amendment challenge.  Because the court will not 
reach a constitutional question if the "issue has 'not been formulat-
ed to bring it into focus, and the evidence has not been offered or 
appraised to decide it,' " Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439 (1965) 
(citation omitted), our review is limited to the type of communica-
tion in which Van Ee has concretely indicated he wishes to engage.

     We first by examine the text in light of the design of the 
statute and the principles that a criminal statute must give 
fair notice of its reach and that the court should avoid where 
possible difficult constitutional questions.  But because the 
text of s 205 does not precisely define the scope of covered 
matters, we follow the instruction of the Supreme Court that 
"it is ... appropriate, in a case that raises questions about 
the scope of the prohibition, to identify the specific policies 
that the provision serves as well as those that counsel against 
reading it too broadly."  Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 
152, 165 (1990).  We therefore look to the history and pur-
poses of the statute, and conclude that Congress had a more 
limited view of s 205's coverage than is evidenced by EPA's 
and the district court's interpretation.

                                A.

     Section 205 applies to federal employees, employees of the 
District of Columbia, and "special Government employee[s]," 
defined as those serving for 130 days or less in a calendar 
year. See 18 U.S.C. s 202(a).  Section 205(a), applicable to 
regular federal employees such as Van Ee, has two parts, one 
barring an employee from assisting with, or sharing in, a 
private party's claim against the United States, s 205(a)(1), 
the other subjecting a federal employee to criminal or civil 
penalties if the employee "acts as an agent or attorney for 
anyone before any department [or] agency ... in connection 
with any covered matter in which the United States is a party 
or has a direct and substantial interest...."  18 U.S.C. 
s 205(a)(2).  A "covered matter" is defined in s 205(h) as 
"any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a 
ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
investigation, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular 
matter."  Id. s 205(h).

     When considering the scope Congress intended for the 
phrase "other particular matter," the court must construe 
such a provision narrowly enough to avoid rendering the 
preceding terms superfluous but broadly enough to avoid 
rendering the catchall phrase superfluous.  See, e.g., Trans 
Union Corp. v. FTC, 81 F.3d 228, 233-34 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  

Endeavoring to give effect to each term that Congress used, 
see, e.g., Crandon, 494 U.S. at 171 (Scalia, J., concurring in 
the judgment), we are persuaded that the length of the list in 
s 205 serves to provide more particularized coverage than 
might have been true had a single broad phrase been used.  
For example, superficially broad terms such as "judicial or 
other proceeding" or "controversy" cannot be read to render 
the remaining terms mere surplusage.  Furthermore, not 
only is the scope of "other particular matter" limited by the 
need to give its neighboring terms independent meaning, but 
two familiar canons of construction lead us to presume that 
Congress intended "other particular matter" to be limited to 
administrative or judicial settings of a similar nature that 
share the same attributes as the preceding terms.  See, e.g., 
Babbitt v. Sweet Home, 515 U.S. at 701-02 (applying doctrine 
of noscitur a sociis or "known by the company it keeps");  
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 575 (1995) (same);  
Bazuaye v. United States, 83 F.3d 482, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1996) 
(applying doctrine of ejusdem generis or "of the same kind, 
class, or nature").

     We do not agree with Van Ee's contention that the terms 
preceding "particular matter" are limited to adversarial pro-
ceedings or formal legal relationships, for the conflicting 
interests at which s 205 is aimed could be equally present, for 
example, were a federal employee to represent a private 
party in its uncontested application for a broadcast license, 
patent, or other valuable benefit.  But the fact that Congress 
specified that s 205 applies with respect to an "application" 
or "request for a ruling or other determination" so as to 
criminalize situations in which a private party seeking a 
governmental benefit enlists the representational assistance 
of a federal employee, who potentially could use confidential 
information or abuse his office or position to assist such a 
party, gives rise to the negative inference that Congress did 
not intend s 205 to act as a general gag order on federal 
employees.

     Rather, looking solely to the text, we tentatively conclude 
that the limiting principle guiding Congress with respect to 
s 205 is that it is to apply only to matters in which the 

governmental decision at stake is focused on conferring a 
benefit, imposing a sanction, or otherwise having a discerna-
ble effect on the financial or similarly concrete interests of 
discrete and identifiable persons or entities.  These are situa-
tions in which a federal employee, acting as a private party's 
agent or attorney, could be perceived as having divided 
loyalty and as using his or her office or inside information to 
corrupt the government's decisionmaking process.5

     This interpretation of s 205's "particular matter" is in 
accord with judicial and administrative interpretations of the 
phrase as it is used in related conflict-of-interest provisions, 
enacted along with s 205 as part of an "Act to strengthen the 
criminal laws relating to bribery, graft, and conflicts of inter-
est, and for other purposes," Pub. L. No. 87-849, 76 Stat. 
1119 (1962) ("1962 Act").6 The circuits that have interpreted 

__________
     5 Section 205 distinguishes between a "covered matter" applica-
ble to regular federal employees and a "covered matter involving a 
specific party or parties" applicable to special Government employ-
ees.  Compare s 205(a)(2) with s 205(c).  Section 203 makes a 
similar distinction and s 207, applicable to former employees, also 
uses the "specific party or parties" limitation.  See 18 U.S.C. 
ss 203(c);  207(a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(C). This distinction suggests poten-
tially broader coverage of the relevant provisions for regular em-
ployees.  The legislative history indicates that the "specific party or 
parties" language was added to render the provisions inapplicable 
to rulemakings with respect to special Government and former 
employees.  See 108 Cong. Rec. 21981 (Oct. 3, 1962);  S. Rep. No. 
2213 at 2-3 (1962).  However, this distinction is muddled by the 
addition of s 207(i), which specifically defines "particular matter" to 
include "rulemaking" while s 207 elsewhere retains the "specific 
party or parties" limitation, in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. 
L. No. 101-194, 18 U.S.C. s 207(i).  Assuming that s 205 covers at 
least some rulemakings with respect to regular employees and none 
with respect to special Government employees, that fact sheds little 
light on whether Congress intended s 205(a)(2) to extend beyond 
rulemakings to the types of administrative settings at issue in the 
instant case.

     6 Other than in the 1962 Act, the phrase "particular matter" 
appears in certain agency-specific conflict-of-interest provisions, 

"particular matter" in these related provisions have similarly 
construed the term to be limited to situations in which a real 
danger of conflicting interests might be present.7  Likewise, 
the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel ("OLC") 
has concluded that "[t]he purpose of this language, ["particu-
lar matter"], throughout the federal conflict of interest laws is 
to limit application of the laws to actions focusing upon 
particular, distinct, and identifiable sets of facts with reason-
ably measurable implications and consequences."  See Appli-
cation of 18 U.S.C. s 205 to Communications Between the 
Nat'l Ass'n of Assistant U.S. Attorneys and the Dept. of 
Justice, 18 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 212, 219 (1994) 
(internal quotations omitted).  OLC explained that "whether 
the object of deliberation, decision, or action constitutes a 
particular matter will depend upon how closely analogous the 
object of the deliberation, decision or action is to the object of 
a typical judicial proceeding, claim, application or other mat-
ter enumerated in section 208."  Id. (quotation and citation 
omitted).  Both OLC and OGE have recognized that s 205 
does not reach "representation ... made in connection with a 
broad policy matter that is directed to the interests of a large 
and diverse group of persons rather than one that is focused 
on the interest of a discrete and identifiable class."  Id. 
(quoting OGE advisory opinion).  In defining "particular mat-

ment of Interior employees).

ter" as used in s 208's ban on a federal employee's partic-
ipation in a matter in which the employee has a financial 
interest, OGE has codified its view of the term:

     The term particular matter encompasses only matters 
     that involve deliberation, decision, or action that is fo-
     cused upon the interest of specific persons, or a discrete 
     and identifiable class of persons.  Such a matter is 
     covered by this subpart even if it does not involve formal 
     parties and may include governmental action such as 
     legislation or policy-making that is narrowly focused on 
     the interest of such a discrete and identifiable persons.  
     The term particular matter, however, does not extend to 
     the consideration or adoption of broad policy options that 
     are directed to the interests of a large and diverse group 
     of persons.
     
5 C.F.R. s 2635.402(b)(3) (1999).

     However, neither the text nor this interpretive consensus 
concerning the general distinction between covered and un-
covered matters fully addresses the more difficult issue pre-
sented in Van Ee's appeal, namely, to determine how particu-
larized the focus of decision or action in a proceeding must be 
for it to be a "particular matter" under s 205.  EPA advised 
Van Ee that even though the public comment phase on a 
resource management plan or similar land-use proposal would 
appear to be a broad policymaking matter outside the scope 
of s 205, if an aspect of such a plan might focus on "a discrete 
and identifiable class of persons" that would turn the proceed-
ing into a covered "particular matter." While determining the 
scope of "particular matter" is fact-specific to a degree, 
because s 205 is a criminal statute, it must be interpreted so 
as to afford fair warning of its reach.  See Crandon, 494 U.S. 
at 160;  cf. Meyers, 692 F.2d at 857.

     Moreover, although our interpretation of s 205's scope 
rests on independent grounds, it is compatible with the 
principle that in interpreting the reach of the statute, a court 
must bear in mind that "where a statute is susceptible of two 
constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitu-
tional questions arise and by the other of which such ques-

tions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter."  Jones v. 
United States, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1222 (1999) (internal quotations 
and citations omitted).  As a public employee Van Ee retains 
his First Amendment rights to speak on matters of public 
concern upon entry into public service.  See e.g., United 
States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 513 U.S. 454, 
465 (1995);  Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High Sch. 
Dist. 205, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968);  Sanjour v. EPA, 56 F.3d 
85, 90 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (in banc).  The district court deter-
mined that Van Ee's proposed communications were related 
to matters of public concern, e.g., Van Ee, 55 F.Supp.2d at 9-
10, and concluded that even though under s 205 Van Ee 
remained free to state his own views on any matter, to join 
any organization and represent it in any non-federal forum, 
and to assist the person who represents an organization 
before a federal agency in preparing the organization's state-
ment, id. at 9, his First Amendment interests were nonethe-
less burdened by EPA's application of s 205 that "discour-
age[s] speech by undermining the motive and opportunity for 
the speech."  Id. at 10.  We need not endorse or reject this 
formulation of the First Amendment issues to agree that Van 
Ee has raised a serious question about the constitutionality of 
applying s 205 to his proposed communications.

     Thus, we examine s 205 to determine whether it is suscep-
tible of being construed so that it does not apply to Van Ee's 
conduct.  Because the text of s 205 leaves ambiguous wheth-
er Congress intended to prohibit a federal employee from 
acting as a representative of citizens' groups of which the 
employee is a member in response to federal agencies' re-
quests for comment on proposed land-use plans, we turn to 
the history and purpose of the statute for further guidance.

Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 504 (1979).

                                B.

     Section 205 was enacted in 1962 as part of what might be 
viewed as a third major effort by Congress to define conflict-
of-interest restrictions for federal employees.  The first phase 

lasted until the mid-nineteenth century, during which only 
limited and targeted prohibitions were in effect.  In the 
second phase, public pressure led to passage of seven statutes 
of broader applicability, some of which were aimed at restrict-
ing federal employees from assisting private parties in prose-
cuting claims against the government.  One of those, 18 
U.S.C. s 283 (repealed 1962), was s 205's direct predecessor.  
In the third phase, Congress enacted s 205 as part of an 
effort to bring greater coherence to the separately-enacted 
statutes from the Civil War era in view of the changed nature 
of the federal government and the Cold War era.8

     Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, federal conflict-of-
interest legislation applied only to specific departments and to 
specific activities, leaving noticeable gaps.9  For example, no 
provision prohibited federal employees from using their posi-
tion, influence, or inside knowledge to act as an agent or 
attorney on behalf of private parties who had asserted claims 
against the United States.  This was problematic because 
before the Court of Claims was established in 1855, private 
claims against the government were handled either through 

__________
     8 Subsequent to s 205's enactment in 1962, Congress broadly 
amended federal conflict-of-interest law in the Ethics in Govern-
ment Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-521, 92 Stat. 1824 (1978) and the 
Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, 103 Stat. 1716, 
1750-51 (1989), and Congress made minor amendments to s 205 in 
Pub. L. No. 101-280 s 5(c) (1990) and in Pub. L. No. 104-177 s 2 
(1996).  These changes do not affect the issues presented in the 
instant case.

     9 An early statute prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury 
from having certain private financial interests or engaging in cer-
tain transactions, such as purchasing public lands, that could con-
flict with his departmental responsibilities.  See 1 Stat. 67 (1789), as 
amended, Rev. Stat. s 243 (1875), 5 U.S.C. s 243 (repealed 1962).  
By contrast, prior to the Civil War-era, other department heads and 
Members of Congress were free to represent private parties in 
court or before commissioners so as to prosecute claims against the 
United States or to speculate in the market for public lands.  See 
Cong. Globe, 32d Cong., 2d Sess. 289-90 (1853) (remarks of Rep. 
Stephens (Ga.)).

private acts of Congress or directly by the relevant executive 
department.  See Special Comm. on the Federal Conflict of 
Interest Laws, Ass'n of the Bar of the City of New York, 
Conflict of Interest and Federal Service [hereinafter "New 
York City Bar Report" or "N.Y. Bar Rept."] 31-32 (1960) 
(footnote omitted).  Claim proceedings before the depart-
ments were often conducted ex parte and without adversary 
proceedings.  Id.  This system led to influence peddling, 
information selling, and the dissipation of public funds.  Id.

     Spurred by presidential pressure and increasing public 
attention to such paradigmatic conflicts of interest, Congress 
enacted seven statutes that applied to the executive branch 
and, in some cases, to Congress.  The first of these, s 205's 
direct predecessor, was "An Act to Prevent Frauds on the 
Treasury of the United States," 10 Stat. 170 s 2 (1853), as 
amended, 18 U.S.C. s 283 (repealed 1962).  Section 283 pro-
hibited an officer or employee of the United States or of the 
Senate or House of Representatives from "act[ing] as an 
agent or attorney for prosecuting any claim against the 
United States, or aid[ing] or assist[ing] in the prosecution or 
support of any such claim...."  Id.  In the 1860s, Congress 
added further prohibitions, partially in response to high-
profile procurement scandals.10  Directly relevant here is 
former 18 U.S.C. s 281, enacted at 13 Stat. 123 (1864), which 
was closely related to former s 283.11  Of the remaining five 
statutes, each also repealed by the 1962 Act, some shared

     10 For example, in one scheme, military employees purchased 
defective rifles from the government for $3.50 each and then resold 
the rifles to the government for $22.  See N.Y. Bar Rept. at 34-35.

     11 Section 281 prohibited receipt of "compensation for any ser-
vices rendered or to be rendered ... in relation to any proceeding, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
matter" in which the United States has an interest.  18 U.S.C. 
s 281 (repealed 1962) (emphasis added).  Prior to 1948, the list 
ended with "other matter or thing."  E.g. United States v. Booth, 
148 F. 112, 114 (C.C.D. Or.1906);  see also Bayless Manning, 
Federal Conflict of Interest Law 52 n.71 (1964).

s 283's limited application to matters involving a "claim 
against the United States".12

     As with current s 205, both former ss 283 and 281 were 
directed at the problem of divided loyalty, targeting a federal 
employee's assistance to outside interests in certain dealings 
with the government.  Section 283 focused on representation-
al assistance by an executive or legislative branch employee, 
other than a Member of Congress, in connection with claims 
against the government, regardless of whether the federal 
employee received compensation.  Section 281 reached a 
broader range of assistance, covering not just prosecution of 
claims against the United States but also the "rendering [of] 
service" in relation to administrative proceedings in which the 
United States has an interest, but applied only where the 
federal employee received compensation for his or her ser-
vices.  Cf. United States v. Meyers, 692 F.2d 823, 856-57 (2d 
Cir. 1982).

     With the dramatic growth of the federal government, the 
nature of federal service changed, giving rise to new potential 
conflicts of interest.  See N.Y. Bar Rept. at 131-34.  In the 
post-New Deal era, and after commencement of the Cold 
War, increasing demand by administrative agencies and the

     12 The statutes repealed by the 1962 Act were:  18 U.S.C. s 216 
(enacted in 1862, prohibiting compensation for assisting in procure-
ment of government contracts);  id. s 434 (enacted in 1863, requir-
ing disqualification from matter in which employee had personal 
interest);  5 U.S.C. s 99 (enacted in 1872, prohibiting former execu-
tive branch employee from prosecuting claim that had been pending 
at the time of his federal employment);  18 U.S.C. s 284 (composite 
of 1919 and 1944 acts as criminal analog to 5 U.S.C. s 99);  id. 
s 1914 (enacted in 1917, prohibiting compensation of government 
employees from outside sources).  See Pub. L. No. 87-849 ss 1(c), 
2, 3, 76 Stat. 1119, 1127-28 (1962);  see also Crandon, 494 U.S. at 
160-63.

          In addition to these branch-wide provisions, Congress peri-
     odically enacted agency-specific prohibitions on outside inter-
     ests.  See, e.g., 24 Stat. 383 (1887) (ICC);  38 Stat. 717 (1914) 
     (FTC);  46 Stat. 797 (1930) (FPC);  48 Stat. 1066 (1934) (FCC);  
     52 Stat. 980 (1938) (CAB).  For exemptions, see H.R. Rep. No. 
     86-2068 at 3-4 (1960).military for specialized government employees, particularly 
scientists and attorneys, led to increased opportunities for 
such employees to capitalize on government service in the 
private sector.  See e.g., S. Rep. No. 87-2213 at 6-7 (1962);  
H.R. Rep. No. 86-2068 at 5-7 (1960);  107 Cong. Rec. 6836 
(Apr. 27, 1961).  Restrictive judicial interpretations of the 
Civil War-era statutes made it apparent that legislation would 
be required to respond to emerging forms of conflicts of 
interest.13  In addition, the increasing number of potential 
temporary government employees who rejected such posi-
tions for fear that the conflict-of-interest provisions, such as 
the revolving door provision, would impede their return to the 
private sector led Congress to adapt federal conflict-of-
interest law to such "special employees".  See, e.g., Hearings 
on H.R. 302, H.R. 3050, H.R. 3411, H.R. 3412, and H.R. 7189 
Before the Antitrust Subcomm. (Subcomm. No. 5) of the 
Comm. on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, 
87th Cong. 106-09, 120-22 (1961) [hereafter House Subcomm. 
Hearings].

     Thus Congress enacted the 1962 Act in response to the 
judicial narrowing of the Civil War-era statutes and the 
changing nature of federal service in an attempt to modern-
ize, clarify, and bring greater coherence to the separately-
enacted Civil War-era statutes.  See Roswell B. Perkins, The 
New Federal Conflict-of-Interest Law, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 1113, 

__________
     13 See, e.g, United States v. Bergson, 119 F.Supp. 459 (D.D.C. 
1954), where the district court dismissed the indictment of a former 
Justice Department attorney for his post-employment representa-
tion of corporate clients seeking pre-merger approval from the 
Department on the ground that 18 U.S.C. s 284 (repealed 1962) did 
not apply because such representation was not in connection with a 
"claim against the United States."  See also Hobbs v. McClean, 117 
U.S. 567, 575 (1886);  United States v. 679.19 Acres of Land, 113 
F.Supp. 590, 593-94 (D.N.D.1953).  Although the district court in 
Bergson construed the term "claim" in the context of s 284, Con-
gress and the President understood the holding to apply to s 283 as 
well.  See, e.g., 107 Cong. Rec. 6836 (Apr. 27, 1961) (message from 
the President);  H.R. Rep. No. 87-748 at 21 (1961);  S. Rep. No. 87-
2213 at 5.

1115-17, 1122-23 (1963).  The 1962 Act was aimed at a host of 
concerns, and s 205 is merely one strand of an intricate 
scheme of regulations governing federal employees' conflicts 
of interest.14  The history of the 1962 Act reflects congres-
sional focus on direct conflicts of interest, misuse of confiden-
tial government information, and abuse of position, confirm-
ing both that Congress intended to broaden the predecessor 
representational-assistance provision, former s 283, beyond 
claims for money or property, and also to limit the breadth to 
other situations in which a private party might improve its 
chances of obtaining a benefit or avoiding a sanction if its 
agent or attorney in such a proceeding were a federal em-
ployee.

     The final version of s 205 emerged as an amalgam of three 
similar bills introduced during the 87th Congress.  See gener-
ally House Subcomm. Hearings.  With respect to the repre-
sentational-assistance provision, each bill expanded the cover-
age of former s 283 beyond claims against the government by 
importing the list of proscribed proceedings that had been 
covered by the compensated assistance provision, former 
s 281, into what is now s 205.15 Although some language in 

__________
     14 For example, surrounding s 205 are provisions making it a 
crime to bribe a federal employee or for such employee to accept a 
bribe (s 201;  cf. 18 U.S.C. s 217, 26 U.S.C. s 7214(a)(9) (1994));  to 
compensate a federal employee for his or her assistance to anyone 
involved in a proceeding in which the United States has a direct and 
substantial interest (s 203);  for certain federal employees to en-
gage in certain post-employment conduct involving the United 
States (s 207);  for an employee to participate in any decision or 
proceeding relating to a matter in which she has a financial interest 
(s 208), and for an employee to receive any "contribution to or 
supplementation of salary" from a non-governmental source (s 209).  
Cf. United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, 119 S.Ct. 
1402, 1408-09 (1999);  see also Crandon, 494 U.S. at 158.

     15 See House Subcomm. Hearings at 7-8, 19, 22-23.  The list 
initially imported, in slightly modified form, into early drafts of 
s 205 was "any proceeding, contract, claim, controversy, charge, 
accusation, arrest or other matter."  Id. at 19 (rearranging and 
omitting "investigation" and "judicial or other proceeding" from the 

the legislative history suggests an understanding that this 
textual change would cover "all" matters coming before a 
federal agency, see H.R. Rep. No. 87-748 at 20, it is readily 
apparent that Congress had a more limited view of its task, 
inserting two additional terms--"application" and "request 
for a ruling or other determination", House Subcomm. Hear-
ings at 53-54--to cover specific types of proceedings in which 
a real conflict of interest might arise.  See H.R. Rep. No. 87-
748 at 21;  see also S. Rep. No. 87-2213 at 5.

     In the 1962 Act, Congress did not intend s 205 to extend 
beyond situations in which there was a real conflict of interest 
or which potentially presented an opportunity for abuse of 
office, misuse of confidential information, or similar conflicts 
of interest to arise.  Congressional reports explained that the 
final bill limited s 205 to situations in which the federal 
employee acts as an "agent or attorney" rather than merely 
"aids or assists" a private party because "inclusion of the 
term 'aids or assists' would permit a broad construction 
embracing conduct not involving a real conflict of interest."  
Id.16  Also, Congress narrowed the catchall phrase from 

__________
s 281 list).  The bills drafted by the Administration and in the New 
York City Bar Report would have grouped these matters under an 
umbrella phrase, "transaction involving the Government," indicating 
an understanding that the list covered those administrative settings 
in which private interests stood to experience ascertainable gains or 
losses resulting from an administrative decision.  See id. at 7, 23.  
In 1989 Congress amended s 205 to group the terms under the 
umbrella phrase "covered matter," defined by the same list of 
matters as had been in subsection (a)(2), in newly added subsection 
(h).  See Ethics Reform Act of 1989 s 404, Pub. L. No. 101-194, 103 
Stat. 1716, 1750-51 (1989).

     16 Similarly, with respect to the revolving door provision, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee opined:

     Whatever the merit of this prohibition at a time when the 
     Government departments were fewer in number and much 
     smaller in size, it makes very little sense today.  Thus, it is 
     hard to advance a reasonable justification for precluding a 
     former Commerce Department attorney, for 2 years or for any 
     length of time, from representing before the Treasury Depart-
     
"other matter" to "other particular matter," in order "to 
emphasize that the restriction applies to a specific case or 
matter and not to a general area of activity."  H.R. Rep. No. 
87-748 at 20.17

     Contemporaneous interpretation of the proscribed list of 
matters covered by s 205 also indicates that the section was 
not intended to apply to a federal employee's volunteer 
activities on behalf of environmental groups because such 
activities would not give rise to the type of divided loyalty at 
which the statute was aimed.  The authors of the New York 
City Bar Report wrote:

     Whether an employee is intermittent or regular, his [or 
     her] political and other organizational affiliations and 
     activities will not be affected by the section except in the 
     most unusual situations.  An employee who is a member 
     of an organization to protect wildlife, for example, will 
     not run afoul of section 4 [the Bar bill's very similar 
     version of s 205], even if he [or she] actively helps the 
     organization in its efforts to influence federal policy in 
     the direction of better wildlife protection.
     
N.Y. Bar Rept. at 209.

     In sum, when crafting s 205, Congress did not intend to 
bar a federal employee from representing outside interests in 
all matters in which the United States has an interest.  
Instead, Congress imported the list of proscribed activities 
from the former compensated-assistance provision (s 281)

     17 When the House Judiciary Committee reported the bill, "oth-
er matter" had become "other particular matter" in the new com-
pensated-assistance provision, s 203, without reflecting a corre-
sponding change in s 205.  See H.R. Rep. No. 87-748 at 1, 37, 39.  
However, in the version of the bill on which the entire House voted, 
"particular" was added before "matter" in s 205 as well.  See H.R. 
8140, as amended, 87th Cong. at 11 (Jul. 20, 1961).

into s 205, updated that list by extending coverage to an 
"application" and "request for a ruling or other determina-
tion," and narrowed the catchall phrase, "other matter", in 
former s 281 to "other particular matter."

                                C.

     This history clarifies EPA's misinterpretation of the scope 
of s 205.  Under EPA's approach, the scope of s 205 turns 
not on the nature of the matter but on the content of the 
federal employee's comments.  For example, EPA advised 
Van Ee that because some of the comments he expected to 
make as a spokesperson in relation to the BLM's plan for 
managing public lands in southern Nevada would focus on use 
of specific parcels of land and on the siting of power lines by 
two utility companies, as well as BLM's proposed acquisition 
of environmentally-sensitive lands in which a local mining 
company had an interest, those comments would be in rela-
tion to a covered "particular matter." By contrast, EPA 
advised, had Van Ee sought to convey to BLM only a 
generalized concern about preserving sufficient recreational 
space, Van Ee's acting as spokesperson would not have been 
in relation to a "particular matter" even though the proceed-
ing--public comment on BLM's resource management plan--
was the same.

     EPA's elastic approach broadens s 205 beyond the range 
intended by Congress, is inconsistent with the OGE regula-
tion on which EPA purportedly relied, and fails to provide 
federal employees with fair warning of the scope of permissi-
ble representational activities.  Rather, whether an adminis-
trative proceeding is a "particular matter" under s 205 is 
determined by the nature and focus of the governmental 
decision to be made or action to be taken as a result of the 
proceeding.  Only where the decision is focused on a probable 
particularized impact on discrete and identifiable parties are 
the concerns animating s 205 implicated.  Thus, EPA's ad-
vice to Van Ee was flawed insofar as it hinged upon the 
specific nature of the comments that Van Ee sought to make 
and their possible relationship to aspects of the decision that 

might ultimately affect specific groups or individuals, rather 
than upon the overall focus of the proceeding itself.

     Even to the extent that some of Van Ee's comments would 
have concerned proposed actions likely to have a discernible 
impact on the interests of identifiable parties, see supra n. 2, 
the focus of the decisions to be made are of a much broader 
nature.  For example, the focus of decision following the 
public comment phase on a proposed EIS - what to include in 
the final EIS - is not on the interests of particular groups or 
individuals.  As the court has recently reiterated, the heart of 
the EIS is the requirement that an agency rigorously explore 
and objectively evaluate the projected environmental impacts 
of all reasonable alternatives for completing the proposed 
action.  City of Alexandria v. Slater, 1999 WL 1204341 *3 
(Dec. 17, 1999) (citing 40 C.F.R. s 1502.14).  Moreover, even 
the types of proposed actions for which the relevant EIS's 
were issued focused on diverse sets of interests, such as how 
to reconcile or balance recreational, conservation, and com-
mercial interests in a land-use plan covering considerable 
territory.

     In other words, the concreteness that s 205 requires by 
way of a "particular matter" is absent when a public interest 
group is responding to an agency's call for public comment on 
a broad plan for land management.  Van Ee does not seek, 
for example, to participate in proceedings involving the grant-
ing of a license to operate a concession on public lands or 
some similar benefit.  Rather, the proceedings in which Van 
Ee seeks to participate call for the provision of the Nevada 
groups' views as to the potential environmental impacts of 
proposed action under consideration.  Although in a very 
broad sense such proceedings may serve to advance the 
interests of a public interest group to the extent that the 
agency adopts its views or moderates proposals to address 
considerations of importance to the public interest group, this 
is hardly the situation that caused Congress to enact a 
criminal statute to preserve the integrity of governmental 
service and decisionmaking.  The OGE regulation expressly 
reflects the understanding that "the term 'particular matter' 
does not extend to the consideration or adoption of broad 

policy options that are directed to the interests of a large and 
diverse group of persons," 5 C.F.R. s 2635.402(b)(3).  The 
proceedings at issue here simply do not present the problems 
that Congress sought to cure as nothing in the record remote-
ly suggests that Van Ee has a real conflict of interest or is 
misusing government information or otherwise abusing his 
position.

     EPA also failed to acknowledge the implications of its 
restrictive interpretation when it opined that the First 
Amendment was not implicated because Van Ee could ex-
press his own views and even prepare the views of the public 
interest groups of which he is a member and explain those 
views to the media.  Allowing Van Ee to do everything except 
identify himself publicly as the author of a group's commen-
tary, would appear to foster secret influence peddling seem-
ingly oblivious to congressional concerns to avoid the misuse 
of governmental information, office, or position.

     For these reasons, we conclude that the prohibitions Con-
gress established in s 205 are not so broad as is stated in 
EPA's advice of April 5, 1996, to Van Ee.  Neither the text 
nor the legislative history demonstrates a congressional in-
tent to prevent federal employees from representing non-
governmental interests without compensation in proceedings 
in which broad policy issues are at stake because the causal 
link giving rise to a conflict of interest would be too insub-
stantial.  Cf. S. Rep. No. 87-2213 at 5-6.  The legislative 
record confirms that Congress intended s 205 to have a 
broader reach than its predecessor but also that s 205 would 
not reach the EIS and similar land-use proceedings in which 
Van Ee seeks to participate as an agent of the environmental 
groups of which he is a member.18  The interpretive consen-

__________
     18 Van Ee also contends that s 205 does not apply to his 
communications because he would not communicate as the "agent or 
attorney" of the groups of which he is a member.  See 18 U.S.C. 
s 205(a)(2).  Relying in part on this court's prior interpretation of 
"agent or attorney," see Bailey, 498 F.2d at 679, the district court 
rejected his contention.  See Van Ee, 55 F.Supp.2d at 7-8.  Our 

sus lends further support to our conclusion that s 205 is 
properly understood to apply to those matters in which a 
federal employee's representational assistance could poten-
tially distort the government's process for making a decision 
to confer a benefit, impose a sanction, or otherwise to directly 
effect the interests of discrete and identifiable persons or 
parties.  As a result, s 205 leaves career federal civil ser-
vants free to voice the concerns of citizens' groups of which 
they are members on broad policy issues because the likeli-
hood that such representational assistance could divide the 
loyalty of the employee or distort the decisionmaking process 
is minimal.  Our interpretation of s 205's scope fully address-
es Congress' concerns about conflicts of interest that may 
arise when federal employees assist outside interests in gov-
ernmental proceedings, while leaving federal employees such 
as Van Ee free to play a representational role for groups of 
which they are a member in certain settings, and also has the 
salutary effect of avoiding potentially grave constitutional 
concerns that would arise were s 205 construed to cover Van 
Ee's acting as a spokesperson for the groups of which he is a 
member.  See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 190 (1991);  see 
also Jones v. United States, 119 S.Ct. at 1228.

     Accordingly, without reaching Van Ee's constitutional chal-
lenges to s 205 or the appearance regulation, 5 C.F.R. 
s 2635.101(b)(14), we reverse the judgment of the district 
court and remand the case so that the district court may 
award declaratory relief to Van Ee consistent with this opin-
ion.19

holding that s 205 does not apply to Van Ee's proposed communica-
tions does not rest on Van Ee's proposed construction of "agent or 
attorney."  See Refine Const. Co. v. United States, 12 Cl.Ct. 56, 61 
(1987);  Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 
730, 739 (1989);  Neder v. United States, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1840 (1999);  
Restatement (Second) of Agency s 1(1) & cmt. a, ss 12-14;  Cf. 
United States v. Sweig, 316 F. Supp. 1148, 1156-57 (S.D.N.Y. 1970).

     19 Van Ee also sought injunctive relief, but the record before 
this court does not provide a basis for such relief.  Compare 28
