Chaka Toure Hutchinson,
          Appellant
                                
                                
                                
             On Appellant's Petition for Rehearing
                                
                                


     Before: Edwards, Rogers and Tatel, Circuit Judges.


                           O R D E R

     Upon consideration of the appellant's petition for
rehearing, it is

     ORDERED that the court's opinion filed on November 6, 2001
be amended as follows:

          Page 10: In the last paragraph, strike the phrase
"further factual development about the 'WALES' check, and." 
Thus, the last paragraph is to read:

          Accordingly, we remand the case to the district
     court for a determination whether retention of
     Hutchinson's identification for the purpose of running
     the "WALES" check was related to the purpose of the
     stop or caused the stop to go on for too long, thereby
     tainting the evidence and statements obtained by the
     police after the attempted "WALES" check.

It is

     FURTHER ORDERED that appellant's petition for rehearing be
granted.


                                        FOR THE COURT:
                                        Mark J. Langer, Clerk
