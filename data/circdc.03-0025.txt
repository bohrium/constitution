          Appeal from the United States District Court 
                  for the District of Columbia 
                           (99cv01905)

     Bruce P. Heppen, Associate General Counsel, Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, argued the cause for 
appellant.  With him on the briefs were Cheryl C. Burke, 
General Counsel, Robert J. Kniaz, Deputy General Counsel, 
and Gerard J. Stief, Frederic H. Schuster, and Mark F. 
Sullivan, Associates General Counsel.

     Stephan H. Peskin argued the cause and filed the brief for 
appellee.

     Before:  Randolph and Rogers, Circuit Judges, and 
Williams, Senior Circuit Judge.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  The issues are whether this 
appeal is timely and, if so, whether sovereign immunity 
shields the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority from 
liability for the design of warning signs on Metro trains.

     On February 5, 1999, six-year-old Tyri Brooks Hammond 
and his mother, Sherreal Abdulwali, were on the platform in 
the U Street-Cardozo Metrorail station, preparing to board a 
Metro train.  Tyri boarded, but the doors closed before his 
mother could get on, and the train pulled away from the 
station.  Alone, Tyri became upset and called to his mother, 
who was running alongside the train, yelling for help.  When 
the train did not stop, Abdulwali immediately reported the 
situation to the station manager.

     As the train left the station and proceeded into a tunnel, 
Tyri moved to the rear of the car and exited through the 
bulkhead doors, attempting to pass into the next car.  The 
train passed over a switching device causing a large gap 
between the two cars.  Tyri fell through this gap and onto the 
tracks.

     When Abdulwali and the station manager heard cries com-
ing from the tunnel, they notified Transit Authority officials, 
who hurried to Tyri.  They found him severely injured, but 
still conscious, seventy feet into the tunnel.  Four days later, 
despite efforts to save him at Children's Hospital, Tyri died 
from his injuries.

     Abdulwali sued the Transit Authority, alleging that its 
negligence in various respects caused the death of her son.  
Among her claims was an allegation that the Transit Authori-
ty failed to warn passengers adequately of the dangers of 
traveling between cars on a moving train.

     The only warning in a Metro car was a sign on each 
bulkhead door that read "No Passage--Except in Emergen-
cy."  The size, location, and language of these signs were 
prescribed in the Transit Authority's contract for the pur-
chase of Metro trains.  WMATA Rapid Rail Transit Car 
Contract 2Z0065, Conformed Technical Specification dated 
June 15, 1979 at s S5.01 INTERIOR SIGNS, (c) Miscellane-
ous Signs.

     The Transit Authority, invoking the defense of sovereign 
immunity, moved to dismiss, or in the alternative for sum-
mary judgment.  The district court granted the Transit Au-
thority's summary judgment motion on all counts except with 
respect to the failure to warn claim.  Abdulwali v. WMATA, 
Civ. No. 99-01905, slip op. at 12, 13 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2000).  
On that count, the court rejected the immunity defense, 
explaining that although the Transit Authority had provided 
specifications for the bulkhead signs in its contract for the 
purchase of Metro cars, those specifications did not prohibit 
the Transit Authority from furnishing cars with additional 
signs or otherwise providing increased warning of the danger 
of passing between cars on a moving train.  Id. at 12.  The 
court issued a "Memorandum Opinion and Order" but did not 
set forth the judgment on a separate document.  On Decem-
ber 15, 2000, the Transit Authority filed a "Motion for Recon-
sideration and Clarification of the November 28, 2000 Order," 
which the district court denied in a single-page order dated 
September 6, 2001.  The Transit Authority now appeals both 
the November 28 order denying its defense of immunity and 
the September 6 order denying reconsideration.

     The first issue is whether the Transit Authority's appeal of 
the November 28 order is timely.  A notice of appeal must be 
"filed ... within 30 days after the judgment ... appealed 
from is entered."  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  A judgment is 
considered "entered for purposes of [Fed. R. App. P.] 4(a) 
when it is entered in compliance with Rule[ ] 58 ... of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7) 
(1999).1  We have held that "the clock on a party's right to 

__________
     1 On December 1, 2002, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7) was amended to 
provide that a judgment is considered entered for appellate pur-

appeal" does not start to run until the district court "enter[s] 
a judgment that complies with Rule 58."  United States v. 
Feuver, 236 F.3d 725, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2001).

     Rule 58 requires that "every judgment ... be set forth on 
a separate document."  Fed R. Civ. P. 58.  A "judgment" is "a 
decree and any order from which an appeal lies," Fed R. Civ. 
P. 54(a), and encompasses interlocutory orders from which an 
appeal lies.  See McCowan v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 908 F.2d 
1099, 1103 (2d Cir. 1990);  see also 10 Charles Alan Wright, 
Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and 
Procedure:  Civil 3d s 2651, at 8 (1998).  Since a court's 
denial of an immunity defense is immediately appealable, see 
KiSKA Constr. Corp. v. WMATA, 167 F.3d 608, 610-11 (D.C. 
Cir. 1999), the district court's November 28 order constituted 
a "judgment," and the court was required to set forth that 
judgment on a separate document for entry by the clerk of 
the court.  See Derrington-Bey v. District of Columbia Dep't 
of Corr., 39 F.3d 1224, 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  The court's 
failure to do so means that the Transit Authority's allotted 
time for filing an appeal never began to run, much less expire.  
The Transit Authority's appeal is therefore timely.  See Unit-
ed States v. Haynes, 158 F.3d 1327, 1330-31 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

     This leaves the question of immunity.  The Transit Author-
ity was created when Congress approved the Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact signed by Ma-
ryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  See Pub. L. 
No. 89-774, 80 Stat. 1324 (1966) (codified as amended at D.C. 
Code Ann. s 9-1107.01 et seq.).  The Compact confers upon 
the Transit Authority the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the 
signatories.  See Beebe v. WMATA, 129 F.3d 1283, 1287 (D.C. 
Cir. 1997).  That immunity has been waived for "torts ... 
committed in the conduct of any proprietary function," but 
preserved for "torts occurring in the performance of a gov-
ernmental function."  D.C. Code Ann. s 9-1107.01(80).

__________
poses after either the judgment has been set forth on a separate 
document or 150 days have run from entry of the judgment in the 
civil docket.

     We have applied a two-part test to determine whether a 
particular activity is governmental or proprietary.  See Burk-
hart v. WMATA, 112 F.3d 1207, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  We 
first ask whether the activity at issue is "quintessentially 
governmental," such as the "operation of a police force."  
Dant v. District of Columbia, 829 F.2d 69, 74 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  
If so, the activity falls within the scope of the Transit 
Authority's immunity.  When the activity is not quintessen-
tially governmental, the relevant inquiry is whether the Tran-
sit Authority's actions were "discretionary."  Discretionary 
activities are "governmental," and thus are protected by 
sovereign immunity.  See Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1216.  Since 
both parties agree, as do we, that the Transit Authority's 
decisions concerning the design and placement of warning 
signs in Metro cars are not a quintessentially governmental 
function, our analysis focuses on whether the Transit Authori-
ty's decisions constituted discretionary functions.

     Discretionary functions are those governmental actions and 
decisions, "based on considerations of public policy" and 
requiring "an element of judgment or choice."  Berkovitz by 
Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536-37 (1988).  If 
any " 'statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a 
course of action' " for the Transit Authority to follow, then no 
discretion is involved, since the Transit Authority has "no 
rightful option but to adhere to the directive."  United States 
v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 322-23 (1991).  In the absence of a 
prescribed course of action, the Transit Authority's decisions 
are discretionary if they involve "political, social, [or] econom-
ic" choices.  Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1217.

     Here, the Compact does not prescribe any design specifica-
tions for Metro cars, leaving the Transit Authority with broad 
discretion to design all transit facilities and to enter into 
contracts for their operation and furnishment.  D.C. Code 
Ann. ss 9-1107.01(12)(f), 13(a).  As a result, the Transit 
Authority was required to make choices, and we must scruti-
nize these choices to determine if they were discretionary.

     Application of the discretionary function test in other con-
texts has generated a morass of conflicting cases.  See, e.g., 

Shansky v. United States, 164 F.3d 688, 693 (1st Cir. 1999) 
(collecting cases).  But one constant in our precedents is that 
the Transit Authority makes discretionary choices when "es-
tablishing 'plans, specifications or schedules' " regarding the 
Metro system.  Beatty v. WMATA, 860 F.2d 1117, 1127 (D.C. 
Cir. 1988).2  We have drawn a distinction between complaints 
alleging negligent design, which the Transit Authority's im-
munity bars, and those alleging negligent maintenance, to 
which the Transit Authority's immunity does not apply.  
Dant, 829 F.2d at 74.

     Here, plaintiff has not alleged that the Transit Authority 
negligently maintained the signs;  she has challenged only the 
adequacy of the signs' warning.  The complaint is aimed at 
the design of the signs as specified in the Transit Car 
Contract.  Sovereign immunity therefore bars her claim.  
Holding otherwise would foster "judicial 'second-guessing' " of 
"political, social, and economic" decisions that the Transit 
Authority's immunity was designed to prevent.  Sanders v. 
WMATA, 819 F.2d 1151, 1155, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting 
United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, 814 (1984)).

     The decision in Cope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445 (D.C. Cir. 1995), 
does not alter our conclusion.  Cope held that the National 
Park Service's decision not to post warning signs at a danger-
ous curve on a slippery road was not discretionary, and 
therefore sovereign immunity did not bar a suit against the 
Park Service for negligence.  The Park Service's decisions 
whether to post signs were governed by engineering stan-
dards rather than its policy judgment;  its decisions thus were 
not discretionary functions.  See Sloan v. Dep't of Hous. & 
Urban Dev., 236 F.3d 756, 764 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  This case 
is different.  Designing the bulkhead signs, or any feature of 
the Metro system, required judgments that were by their 
nature susceptible to a policy analysis.  See Dant, 829 F.2d at 
74.  The Transit Authority doubtless considered matters such 
as safety, aesthetics, cost, and a desire to alert passengers to 
the danger of moving between cars without discouraging

them from so moving during emergencies.  Judicial review 
"in such decisionmaking through private tort suits would 
require the courts to 'second guess' " the Transit Authority's 
policy judgments.  See Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 820.  
Accordingly, the sign specifications fall within the scope of a 
discretionary function, and sovereign immunity barred the 
failure to warn claim.  See Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1217.

     The district court's denial of the Transit Authority's immu-
nity defense is reversed.  The appeal of the motion to recon-
sider is moot.
