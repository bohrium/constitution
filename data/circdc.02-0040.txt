     Dissenting opinion filed by Senior Circuit Judge Williams.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  The appellant, 
Mary Louise Cummings, seeks reversal of the district court's 
September 6, 2000 dismissal of her Privacy Act lawsuit 
against the Department of the Navy (Navy).  The district 
court held that the doctrine of Feres v. United States, 340 
U.S. 135 (1950), bars a servicewoman's Privacy Act lawsuit if 
her injury arose out of or occurred in the course of activity 
"incident to service."  Cummings v. Dep't of the Navy, 116 
F. Supp. 2d 76, 78-82 (D.D.C. 2000).  The court further 
determined on the facts that Cummings's injury did, indeed, 
arise in the course of activity incident to her service.  See id. 
at 82-84.  On appeal, Cummings challenges the district 
court's decision on two grounds.  First, she argues that the 
Feres doctrine does not apply to service personnel's Privacy 
Act claims against the military.  Second, she contends that 
even if the doctrine does attach to such suits generally, the 
unauthorized release of her training record to a civilian 
author was not incident to service under Feres's case-specific 
inquiry and that her suit against the Navy, therefore, is not 
barred.

     Whether members of the armed forces may sue the mili-
tary for damages under the Privacy Act is a question of first 
impression.  We answer in the affirmative and hold that the 
Feres doctrine does not extend to suits under the Privacy Act.  
Accordingly, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Cum-
mings's action and remand for further proceedings address-
ing her specific Privacy Act allegations.

                                I.

     Cummings attended the United States Naval Academy, 

completed flight training and became a Naval aviator.1  She 
was assigned to a flight squadron at the Naval Air Station, 
Cecil Field, in Jacksonville, Florida and began training on the 
Strike Fighter Attack 18--a.k.a. "Hornet"--aircraft in No-
vember 1994.  Approximately seven months after Cum-
mings's Hornet training began, the Navy convened a Field 
Naval Aviator Evaluation Board (Evaluation Board) to assess 
her flying skills and potential.  After hearing testimony and 
reviewing the records of Cummings's four training flights, the 
Evaluation Board recommended that the Navy terminate her 
flying status.  Notwithstanding the Evaluation Board's con-
clusion, Vice Admiral Richard Allen--Commander of the 
Navy's Atlantic Fleet--directed Cummings to retain her 
flight status and resume Hornet training under the same 
administrative command.

     During Cummings's time at Cecil Field, the Navy permit-
ted an author, Robert Gandt, to observe Hornet training so 
that he could research a book he was writing about the 
training of fighter pilots.  Cummings alleges in her complaint 
that Vice Admiral Allen "allowed Gandt to follow specific 
squadron personnel without their knowledge as they proceed-
ed throughout the [Hornet] training program."  Cummings, 
116 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (quoting Compl. p 13).

     In 1997 Gandt published his book, Bogeys and Bandits:  
Making of a Fighter Pilot.  The book was based primarily 
upon Gandt's observations of the Hornet training program 
and upon Navy-supplied information.  Cummings asserts that 
a character in Gandt's book named "Sally Hopkins" portrays 
Cummings, that the book includes specific details and direct 
quotes from her negative Evaluation Board report, that as a 
result of the book's publication "her military and civilian 
career prospects have been severely damaged" and that "she 
has suffered severe mental distress, embarrassment, and

     1 The following factual account is drawn largely from the "Factual 
Background" portion of the district court order, Cummings, 116 
F. Supp. 2d at 77-78, which in turn is "drawn from the allegations 
in the [c]omplaint."  Id. at 77 n.2.

humiliation, both personally and professionally."  Id. (quoting 
Compl. p 65).

     Cummings sued the Navy for violating the Privacy Act of 
1974.  See 5 U.S.C. s 552a(b) ("No agency shall disclose any 
record which is contained in a system of records by any 
means of communication to any person ... except pursuant 
to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, 
the individual to whom the record pertains....").  The Navy 
moved to dismiss Cummings's claim on Feres grounds.  The 
district court held that Feres applies to Privacy Act lawsuits 
and that the Navy's release of Cummings's Evaluation Board 
report was "incident to service"--and, therefore, not action-
able--because it "was related to the policy [of openness] the 
Navy had ... established toward Mr. Gandt."  Cummings, 
116 F. Supp. 2d at 84.

                               II.

     Reviewing the district court's grant of the Navy's motion to 
dismiss, we accept as true the facts that Cummings alleges in 
her complaint.  See El-Hadad v. United Arab Emirates, 216 
F.3d 29, 32 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing Saudi Arabia v. 
Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 351 (1993)).  Our review of the issues 
raised by Cummings's appeal is de novo.  See Artis v. Green-
span, 158 F.3d 1301, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 1998) ("[W]e apply the de 
novo standard of review to the district court's application of 
law to undisputed fact[s].").

                                A.

     In Feres, the United States Supreme Court held that "the 
Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act 
for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or 
are in the course of activity incident to service."  Feres, 340 
U.S. at 146.  Cummings argues that this doctrine should not 
be extended to suits against government agencies under the 
Privacy Act.  For the reasons discussed infra, we agree.

     In determining whether members of the armed forces may 
sue the military for damages under the Privacy Act, we start 

with the "cardinal" canon of statutory construction:  "[C]ourts 
must presume that [the Congress] says in a statute what it 
means and means in a statute what it says there."  Conn. 
Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992) (citations 
omitted).  "When the words of a statute are unambiguous, 
then, this first canon is also the last:  'judicial inquiry is 
complete.' "  Id. at 254 (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449 
U.S. 424, 430 (1981)).  With these precepts in mind, we turn 
to the text of the Privacy Act.

     As the district court recognized, the Privacy Act "applies to 
'agencies,' defined as 'any executive department, military 
department, Government corporation, Government controlled 
corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of 
the government ... or any independent regulatory agency.' " 
Cummings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 78 n.5 (quoting 5 U.S.C. 
s 552(f)) (emphasis added).  And, as the trial court further 
observed, certain provisions of the Act manifest congressional 
intent to protect uniformed personnel like Cummings.  See 
id. at 78 n.5, 81 (citing 5 U.S.C. ss 552(f), 552a(g)(1), 
552a(k)(5) and 552a(k)(7)).  One provision permits agencies, in 
certain circumstances, to exempt from the Act's purview 
"investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of 
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for ... 
military service...."  5 U.S.C. s 552a(k)(5).  Another allows 
exemption--again, in limited circumstances--of "evaluation 
material used to determine potential for promotion in the 
armed services...."  5 U.S.C. s 552a(k)(7).  The district 
court rightly noted that such exemptions "would be unneces-
sary if military servicepersons were excluded from the Priva-
cy Act altogether."  Cummings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 78 n.5.

     We conclude that the aforementioned provisions, taken 
together, demonstrate that the Congress unambiguously in-
tended to establish a duty that runs from a "military depart-
ment" (like the Navy) to military personnel (like Cummings) 
not to "disclose any record which is contained in a system of 
records" (like Cummings's Evaluation Board report).  5 
U.S.C. s 552a(b).  The Navy does not contest this.  Instead, 
it contends that "without necessarily waiving immunity with 
respect to money damages," the Congress "intended to apply 

the Act to 'military departments' " by permitting a service-
member to seek equitable remedies only.  Br. of Appellee at 
25.  Its contention finds no support in the text of the statute;  
without regard to the identity of the plaintiff or the agency 
she is suing, the Act plainly authorizes injunctive relief, 5 
U.S.C. s 552a(g)(2)(A), (3)(A), and monetary relief, 5 U.S.C. 
s 552a(g)(4),2 and it permits a court to "assess against the 
United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation 
costs," 5 U.S.C. s 552a(g)(2)(B), (3)(B).  Moreover, that the 
Act (as seen supra) allows a military department to exempt 
from the Act's reach certain records based upon their con-
tent,3 see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. s 552a(k)(5), (7), demonstrates that 
the Congress did not intend the courts to craft additional 
exemptions from coverage based upon the type of relief a 
servicewoman requests (i.e., by limiting suits to equitable 
relief only).  See Fawn Mining Corp. v. Hudson, 80 F.3d 519, 
523 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ("Neither lawyers nor judges serve as 
back-seat lawmakers who may extend statutes beyond their 
bounds or change the rules that Congress has set.").

     The district court correctly reminded us that "waivers of 
sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and 
narrowly construed," Cummings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 81 
(quoting Dorsey v. Dep't of Labor, 41 F.3d 1551, 1555 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994)).  Erroneously, however, it denied effect to the 
unequivocally expressed waiver contained in the Privacy Act, 
5 U.S.C. s 552a(g).  Construing a waiver of sovereign immu-

__________
     2 Section 552a(g)(4) provides:

     In any suit brought under the provisions of ... this [Act] in 
     which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner 
     which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be 
     liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of ... 
     actual damages sustained by the individual ... and ... the 
     costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as 
     determined by the court.
     
     3 Whether the Navy has exempted--and whether s 552a(k) per-
mits it to exempt--Cummings's report from the requirements of 
the Privacy Act are issues to be addressed, if at all, on remand.  
We express no opinion on those matters here.

nity narrowly, even "strictly in favor of the sovereign," means 
only that a court may not "enlarge[ ] [the waiver] beyond 
what the language requires."  Tomasello v. Rubin, 167 F.3d 
612, 618 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. Nordic 
Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992)).  We need not "enlarge" 
by any stretch the Privacy Act's purview in order for the 
statute to avoid the effects of the Feres doctrine.  As the 
district court acknowledged, "[o]n its face, the Privacy Act 
would appear to permit actions brought by military person-
nel...."  Cummings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 81.  And statutory 
text remains the best evidence of congressional intent.  See 
Tataranowicz v. Sullivan, 959 F.2d 268, 276 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  
The Act not only appears to, but does, permit actions brought 
by military personnel.

     The fact that "the Privacy Act was enacted once the Feres 
doctrine was in place, yet does not specifically [insulate] the 
causes of action it creates from the effects of Feres," Cum-
mings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 81, does not alter our conclusion.  
Congressional enactments are better evidence of legislative 
intent than is congressional silence.  See Burns v. United 
States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991) ("[A]n inference drawn from 
congressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it is 
contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of con-
gressional intent.");  but cf. Arthur Conan Doyle, Silver 
Blaze, in 1 Sherlock Holmes:  The Complete Novels and 
Stories 455, 475 (1986) ("I had grasped the significance of the 
silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests 
others....  Obviously the midnight visitor was someone 
whom the dog knew well.").  True, the Congress's familiarity 
with Feres can be presumed, see Wash. Legal Found. v. 
United States Sentencing Comm'n, 17 F.3d 1446, 1450 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994) (citation omitted), but the Feres doctrine was not 
extended beyond the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) con-
text until 1983.  See generally Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 
296 (1983) (applying Feres to constitutional tort claims under 
Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of 
Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)).  When the Congress enacted 
the Privacy Act in 1974, therefore, it had no reason to insulate 

the Act from the effects of a doctrine that, at the time, 
applied exclusively to the FTCA.

     That the Congress did not bark about Feres in enacting the 
Privacy Act is especially unenlightening in view of the fact 
that a Privacy Act lawsuit does not implicate any of the 
concerns that caused the Supreme Court to enunciate the 
Feres doctrine in the first place.  Cf. Lockhart v. Fretwell, 
506 U.S. 364, 373 (1993) (applying maxim "[c]essante ratione 
legis, cessat et ipsa lex" (when reason for law ceases, so does 
law itself)).  In formulating the (oft-criticized) Feres doctrine, 
the Supreme Court first observed that because the FTCA 
provides that "[t]he United States shall be liable ... in the 
same manner and to the same extent as a private individual 
under like circumstances," Feres, 340 U.S. at 141 (quoting 28 
U.S.C. s 2674), an "obvious shortcoming" in the plaintiffs' 
claims was that they pointed to "no liability of a 'private 
individual' even remotely analogous to that which they [were] 
asserting against the United States."  Id.  Second, the Court 
found that because of the "distinctively federal" relationship 
between the United States and its military forces, the Con-
gress could not have intended the armed forces to be subject 
to local tort law pursuant to the FTCA's provisions.  Id. at 
142-44 (quoting United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 
301 (1947)).  Third, the Court found that because servicemen 
were already entitled to veterans' benefits, the Congress 
could not have meant for them to recover double compensa-
tion for their injuries by allowing them to sue under the 
FTCA as well.  Id. at 144.  Four years after Feres, in United 
States v. Brown, 348 U.S. 110 (1954), the Court offered a 
fourth justification for military immunity from the FTCA--
the "peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his 
superiors, the effects of the maintenance of [tort] suits on 
discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits 
under the [FTCA] were allowed for negligent orders given or 
negligent acts committed in the course of military duty...."  
Brown, 348 U.S. at 112.

     Cummings convinces us that none of these rationales sup-
ports extension of the Feres doctrine to the Privacy Act.  The 
Supreme Court's first concern is inapplicable to a Privacy Act 

lawsuit because the Act, unlike the FTCA, nowhere estab-
lishes the private liability parallel as a prerequisite for the 
"United States [to] be liable ... in the same manner and to 
the same extent ... under like circumstances...."  Feres, 
340 U.S. at 141 (quoting 28 U.S.C. s 2674).  Feres's second 
and third rationales are likewise inapposite because the Priva-
cy Act is federal (not state) law and because the Congress has 
provided no other compensation or benefits for those injured 
by a violation of the Act.

     The Navy makes a superficially compelling argument that 
Feres's fourth concern (as expounded in Brown) mandates the 
doctrine's extension to Privacy Act suits.  The portion of the 
district court order addressing the matter strengthens the 
Navy's case:  "The [possibility] that every time a serviceman 
were demoted or saddled with a less than perfect perfor-
mance rating he could resort to the courthouse could be a 
very real one if Privacy Act suits were not subject to the 
Feres doctrine."  Cummings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 82 (quota-
tions omitted).  Although judicial reluctance to impinge on 
military matters is understandable in many contexts,4 it is 

__________
     4 In Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d 462 (D.C. Cir. 1986), for example, we 
applied the Feres doctrine to a 42 U.S.C. s 1985(3) suit by a 
military officer against her superiors because the Supreme Court's 
"analysis in Feres and Chappell that courts should not imply 
damage remedies for service-connected injuries is fully applicable 
to" such suits generally.  Bois, 801 F.2d at 469 (emphasis added).  
In addition, we extended Feres to the officer's intentional tort 
claims against her superiors because "subjecting military command-
ers to personal liability" for such claims would "pose[ ] an equal, if 
not greater, threat to military discipline as would permitting suits 
under the FTCA."  Id. at 471.

 Bois's reasoning remains sound.  We do not mean to imply 
otherwise by declining to extend it here;  we simply note that 
neither of the concerns prompting our decision in that case exists in 
the Privacy Act context.  Likewise, by declining to extend Feres to 
the Privacy Act, we are not--contrary to the assertion of our 
dissenting colleague--"abandon[ing]" it because it is "under a 
cloud."  Dissenting op. at 6.  Nor are we fashioning "a rule rather 
arbitrarily cutting [Feres] off with the exact applications already 

unjustified in this setting;  as we have discussed, the Con-
gress clearly enlisted the federal courts to inquire into poten-
tial military violations of the Privacy Act.  Cf. United States 
v. Johnson, 481 U.S. 681, 699 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("I 
do not think the effect upon military discipline is so certain, 
or so certainly substantial, that we are justified in holding (if 
we are ever justified in holding) that Congress did not mean 
what it plainly said in the statute before us.").  What is more, 
subjecting the Navy to suit under the Act does not permit a 
servicewoman like Cummings to "resort to the courthouse" 
simply because she does not agree with her performance 
ratings.  Instead, the Act provides a remedy only if the 
military department has unlawfully released the performance 
rating and if the claimant establishes that she was injured as 
a result.  See 5 U.S.C. s 552a(b) (prohibiting disclosure in 
certain circumstances);  5 U.S.C. s 552a(g)(1)(D) (requiring 
claimant to show "adverse effect" because of disclosure).

     The Navy claims that because Feres has been extended 
beyond the FTCA context to suits under civil rights statutes 
and to common-law and constitutional tort actions, we must 
extend it as well to suits under the Privacy Act.  See Br. of 
Appellee at 17-18 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Stanley, 
483 U.S. 669, 682 (1987);  Chappell, 462 U.S. at 300).  It is 
true that we, like other circuits, have extended Feres to bar 
claims brought "under both 42 U.S.C. s 1985(3) for depriva-
tion of ... civil rights and under common-law tort theories."  
Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d at 468;  see supra note 4;  see also, 
e.g., Mackey v. United States, 226 F.3d 773, 776 (6th Cir. 
2000) (joining D.C., Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth 
and Ninth Circuits in "hold[ing] that the Feres doctrine 
applies to intentional torts");  Alvarez v. Wilson, 600 F. Supp. 
706, 712 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (extending Feres to claims brought 
under s 1985(3)).  But that fact in itself means nothing;  we 
have also concluded "that the Feres doctrine and its rationale 

__________
found by the Supreme [C]ourt and no more."  Id.  Instead, we are 
merely holding that the Privacy Act means what it says.  We would 
hope that that is not an option "available only to the Supreme 
Court."  Id.

have no application to claims [brought by members of the 
armed forces] under the Swine Flu Act" because we cannot 
"imagine how [that] type of litigation could impinge on any 
legitimate interest in maintaining discipline within our fight-
ing forces."  Hunt v. United States, 636 F.2d 580, 599 (D.C. 
Cir. 1980).  That is, even "[d]espite the absence of a clear 
legislative intent" in the Swine Flu Act to insulate the legisla-
tion from the effects of Feres, we have nonetheless found it 
insulated.  Id. at 589.  Because "the duty remains ours to 
determine the meaning of [a particular] statute," id., and to 
determine whether the Congress in a particular statute in-
tended to provide service personnel with a cause of action 
against the military departments, the bare fact that the Feres 
doctrine has been extended beyond the FTCA to other statu-
tory contexts is not particularly probative.  The Congress 
may provide a cause of action in some laws and leave other 
statutes subject to Feres;  it is our job to sort out which it has 
done here.  As the district court correctly noted, "[n]o court 
has yet provided an analysis of whether or not Feres should 
apply to actions under the Privacy Act" specifically.  Cum-
mings, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 79.  It would appear, then, that we 
have a clean slate to implement the Congress's will and to 
permit Cummings to seek monetary relief from the Navy for 
the allegedly unauthorized release of her training record to a 
civilian author.

                                B.

     Because we conclude that the Feres doctrine is inapplicable 
to Cummings's action against the Navy, we need not address 
whether the release of her record was "incident to service" 
under Feres's case-specific test.  That test is irrelevant and 
the issue is moot.

                               III.

     Given a clear congressional mandate, we hold that the 
doctrine of Feres v. United States does not extend to Privacy 
Act lawsuits brought by military personnel against the mili-
tary departments.  Accordingly, we reverse the district 

court's dismissal of Cummings's action against the Navy.  
She may proceed with her action on remand.

                                                                 So ordered.

     Williams, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:  Feres v. Unit-
ed States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950), holds that the Federal Torts 
Claims Act ("FTCA") waiver of sovereign immunity is inappli-
cable to suits by uniformed military personnel for injuries 
arising out of activity "incident to service."  The Feres doc-
trine is under something of a cloud.  See, e.g., United States 
v. Johnson, 481 U.S. 681, 700 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) 
("Feres was wrongly decided and heartily deserves the 'wide-
spread, almost universal criticism' it has received.").  None-
theless, the Supreme Court, this court and our fellow circuits 
have all consistently extended Feres beyond the FTCA.  That 
they have done so is unsurprising for damage actions that 
carry a genuine risk of disrupting the hierarchical command 
relations among military personnel--after all, that is the risk 
that ultimately underlies Feres.  Comparing Privacy Act 
damage actions with other claims that the Supreme Court 
and this court have found barred by Feres, I see neither any 
greater hint from Congress that Feres should not govern, nor 
any indication that Privacy Act damage claims pose less risk 
of interference with command relations.  This leads me to the 
conclusion that Cummings's claim is precluded.

     It might seem at first blush that the Privacy Act's explicit 
provisions addressing the military might justify non-
application of Feres.  The Act purports to govern "any execu-
tive department, military department, Government corpora-
tion, Government controlled corporation, or other establish-
ment in the executive branch of the government ... or any 
independent regulatory agency."  5 U.S.C. s 552(f) (incorpo-
rated into the Privacy Act by 5 U.S.C. s 552a(a)(1) & s 552a 
note (References in Text)).  But Congress similarly specified 
the military in the FTCA.  "Federal agency," the FTCA's 
basic unit for liability, see 28 U.S.C. s 2675, is defined to 
include "the military departments," id. s 2671.

     The Privacy Act also exempts certain military documents 
from protection under limited circumstances.  See, e.g., 5 
U.S.C. s 552a(k)(5) (discussing "investigatory material com-
piled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibil-
ity, or qualifications for ... military service");  5 U.S.C. 

s 552a(k)(7) (addressing "evaluation material used to deter-
mine potential for promotion in the armed services").  But 
these provisions provide no basis for refusing to apply Feres;  
once again, the FTCA has similar language.  It exempts 
claims "arising out of the combatant activities of the military 
or naval force, or the Coast Guard, during time of war," 28 
U.S.C. s 2680;  yet Feres applies to all claims, combat-related 
or not, wartime or peacetime.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Shearer, 473 U.S. 52 (1985) (applying Feres to claim involving 
crime off duty and off base).

     Indeed, any inferences against Feres drawn from a stat-
ute's explicit coverage and partial exemptions of the military 
are weaker for Privacy Act damage actions than for the 
FTCA.  The Privacy Act creates a range of specific, non-
damage remedies, see 5 U.S.C. s 552a(g)(2) & (3), which the 
government concedes remain fully applicable.  Navy Br. at 
25.  Cf. Jorden v. National Guard Bureau, 799 F.2d 99, 110-
11 (3d Cir. 1986) (distinguishing between monetary and in-
junctive relief in applying Feres to s 1983).  But the FTCA 
provides only damage actions.  Thus there is a broad world to 
which the military-specific language of the Privacy Act can 
apply, while Feres leaves the FTCA's similar language with 
little or no role.

     More generally, we have understood Feres to create the 
equivalent of a "clear statement" rule.  In finding it applica-
ble to claims under 42 U.S.C. s 1985(3), we said:

     ... Feres itself represents a refusal to read statutes with 
     their ordinary sweep.  The unique setting of the military 
     led the Feres Court to resist bringing the armed services 
     within the coverage of a remedial statute in the absence 
     of an express Congressional command.
     
Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d 462, 469 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1986) 
(emphasis added);  see also Coffman v. State of Michigan, 120 
F.3d 57, 59 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that ADA and Rehabilita-
tion Act do not apply to the military absent a "clear di-
rection" from Congress (emphasis added));  Roper v. Depart-
ment of Army, 832 F.2d 247, 248 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that 
in the "absence of some express indication" from Congress, 

Title VII does not apply to the military).  In the Privacy Act 
there is no more of an "express Congressional command" 
than there is in the FTCA.

     The Supreme Court has itself extended Feres to all Bivens 
actions.  United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 681-84 
(1987);  Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296 (1983).  Bivens, of 
course, imposes liability on individual officials, as indeed 
does the liability under 42 U.S.C. s 1985(3) that in Bois we 
found subject to Feres.  Thus one might write off both 
Stanley and Chappell, and Bois, as extensions addressed to 
some special anxiety that might flow from individual exposure 
to liability.  Compare Maj. Op. at 9 n.4.  That is, of course, 
conceivable.  But it is a rather odd spin on Feres itself, which 
after all involved only government liability.  There is no basis 
in the Supreme Court opinions for some idea that the disci-
pline issues explaining Feres depend materially on the nomi-
nal defendant.  That is not surprising, in view of the wide-
spread government provision for reimbursement of officers 
found liable for acts committed in the service of government.  
See, e.g., Huang v. Johnson, 251 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001) 
(noting that the "vast majority" of s 1983 claims that the 
Second Circuit handles involve state indemnification of the 
individual defendants);  see also Board of County Commis-
sioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 436 (1997) 
(Breyer, J., dissenting) (listing various state statutes "autho-
rizing indemnification of employees found liable under s 1983 
for actions within the scope of their employment").

     Alternatively, one might write Stanley/Chappell off as sim-
ply an exercise of judicial restraint when implying damage 
actions (such implication is, of course, the only basis for 
Bivens).  See Stanley, 483 U.S. at 679.  But we have already 
rejected this as too narrow a view.  In Bois, confronting 
exactly such an argument by the dissenting judge, we said:

     But Chappell will not reasonably bear such a crabbed 
     interpretation.  To the contrary, the Supreme Court 
     expressly held in Chappell that the same analysis, based 
     on concern with the disruption of military discipline, 
     applies regardless of whether a court is asked to enter-
     
     tain an intramilitary suit under the Constitution or a 
     statute.
     
801 F.2d at 470 n.13 (citing explicit passages from Chappell).

     Thus we must address the kinds of risks to military disci-
pline that damage actions under the Privacy Act pose.  For 
damage actions under the Act (in contrast with claims for 
specific relief), the plaintiff must show that the agency action 
was "intentional or willful."  5 U.S.C. s 552a(g)(4).  Proof 
that such an intent underlies the alleged breach (here an 
impermissible release of data) is likely to take the factfinder 
deep into the breach's context.  Indeed, the complaint here 
affirmatively asserts that the release arose out of sharply 
contested views about Cummings's performance as a trainee 
on "Hornet" aircraft.  See Complaint p p 5-43;  see generally 
Maj. Op. at 2-4.  How does this stack up against the plain 
vanilla sex discrimination claim involved in Bois?  I cannot 
imagine why it would less involve "second guessing of military 
decisions by civilian courts," Bois, 801 F.3d at 470, or less 
"require testimony by military personnel about command 
decisions," id., or less "tend to pit a plaintiff's superiors 
against one another," id.  Indeed, damage actions under 
s 552a(g)(4) seem quite commonly to yield evidence of pro-
longed workplace donnybrooks.  See, e.g., Tomasello v. 
Rubin, 167 F.3d 612, 614-17 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (involving 
government employee's claim of various unauthorized disclo-
sures in conjunction with an alleged pattern of ethnic and age 
discrimination);  Mount v. U.S. Postal Service, 79 F.3d 531 
(6th Cir. 1996) (involving employee's claim that certain disclo-
sures of medical and other records to director and union 
official were motivated by a desire to retaliate for complaints 
about work conditions);  Henson v. NASA, 14 F.3d 1143, 1146 
(6th Cir. 1994) (involving employee's claim that superior 
released confidential medical information, "intentionally or 
negligently inflicted severe emotional distress ... [and] en-
gaged in an intentional, reckless, malicious, and tortious 
pattern of abusive management" as part of a pattern of 
retaliation).  So Bois, I believe, controls.

     In sharp contrast is Hunt v. United States, 636 F.2d 580 
(D.C. Cir. 1980), where we found Feres inapplicable to the 
"substituted liability" regime established under the Swine Flu 
Act.  Id. at 583 n.3.  To encourage flu vaccine production, the 
government had assumed responsibility for product liability 
suits against the manufacturers, id. at 591-92, though assign-
ing the United States a possible right of later indemnification, 
id. at 595-96.  Suits under the Swine Flu Act therefore 
involved claims of tortious conduct only by the manufacturer, 
conduct that seems as remote from matters of military disci-
pline and command as one can imagine.

     I dissent primarily because the court's decision seems to 
me inconsistent with the principles laid down by the Supreme 
Court in its Feres jurisprudence, and with our circuit's clear 
understanding of those principles.  But it's worth noting that 
other circuits have carried Feres well beyond its FTCA 
origins, applying it to s 1983 claims,1 to various antidiscrimi-
nation statutes such as Title VII,2 the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act,3 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.4  
And it has been applied to various admiralty waivers of 
immunity, such as those in the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 
U.S.C. App. s 742 et seq., and the Public Vessels Act, 46 
U.S.C. App. s 781 et seq.5  As the Ninth Circuit has ob-

been interpreted broadly," so that "practically any suit that 
'implicates ... military judgments and decisions' runs the 
risk of colliding with Feres."  Bowen, 125 F.3d at 803 (case 
citations omitted).

     Feres is, as I observed earlier, under a cloud.  The most 
plausible solutions seem to be (1) consistent application of its 
principle;  (2) a rule rather arbitrarily cutting it off with the 
exact applications already found by the Supreme court and no 
more;  and (3) complete abandonment.  As the second and 
third options are available only to the Supreme Court, Rodri-
guez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 
477, 484 (1989);  Khan v. State Oil Co., 93 F.3d 1358, 1364 (7th 
Cir. 1996) (Posner, C.J.) ("We have been told by our judicial 
superiors not to read the sibylline leaves of the U.S. Reports 
for prophetic clues to overruling."), I would proceed with the 
first.

     I respectfully dissent.
