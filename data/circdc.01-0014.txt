     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  In No. 99-
3071, Scott Lee Feuver, a/k/a Scott Lee Feuer, appeals from 
the district court's denial of his Section 2255 motion.  The 
government asserts that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear 
the appeal because Feuver's notice of appeal is untimely 
under Rule 4(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure.  We agree and accordingly dismiss the appeal.1

                          I. BACKGROUND

     Scott Lee Feuver was charged with six counts of bank 
robbery and attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
s 2113(a) and one count of attempted robbery in violation of 
D.C. Code Ann. s 22-2902.  On December 12, 1996 Feuver 
pleaded guilty to three counts of bank robbery and on July 
18, 1997 he was sentenced to 115 months of imprisonment, 3 
years of supervised release and a $300 special assessment.  
At the sentencing hearing, Feuver asserted that the public 
defender representing him had been ineffective and sought 
the appointment of new counsel.  The district court refused 
to appoint new counsel and also denied Feuver's motion to 
withdraw his plea.

     On August 4, 1997 Feuver filed in the district court a pro se 
Section 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct the sen-
tence alleging primarily that his lawyer's inadequate perfor-
mance had deprived him of effective assistance of counsel.  
On September 28, 1998 the district court denied the Section 
2255 motion without holding a hearing.  The district court

     1 In No. 99-3065, Feuver appeals the district court's denial of his 
motion to set aside the order denying the Section 2255 motion.  As 
explained infra at note 3, we conclude that all appealable issues in 
No. 99-3065 are abandoned.

order was entered on October 21, 1998.2  Feuver asserts he 
never received notice of the district court's decision.

     Over five months later, on March 30, 1999 Feuver filed with 
the district court a "Motion for Determination of Status" 
seeking information about his case.  On April 6, 1999 the 
district court directed the Clerk of Court to send Feuver a 
copy of the September 28, 1998 order.  See United States v. 
Feuver, Criminal No. 96-397 (TPJ) (D.D.C. Apr. 6, 1999).  On 
April 27, 1999 Feuver, through his new counsel, John A. 
Briley, Jr., moved to set aside and vacate the September 28, 
1998 order.  The district court promptly denied the motion on 
April 29, 1999.  See United States v. Feuver, Criminal No. 
96-397 (TPJ) (D.D.C. Apr. 29, 1999).  On May 10, 1999 Briley 
submitted an "Application for Certificate of Appealability

     2 Because of its importance to the jurisdictional question, we set 
forth the complete text of the district court order:

                              Order
               Upon consideration of the motion under 28 U.S.C. s 2255 to 
     vacate, set aside, or correct sentence by a person in federal 
     custody [16] [sic] the government's opposition thereto, the 
     movant's pro se memoranda in support thereof, the memoranda 
     by counsel for movant in support thereof, the affidavit of 
     movant's former counsel, Assistant Federal Public Defender 
     Valencia R. Rainey, and the entire record herein, it is this 28th 
     day of September, 1998,
     
          ORDERED, it appearing to the Court that movant has failed 
     to establish that his attorney provided representation that was, 
     "outside the wide range of professionally competent assis-
     tance," Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984), and 
     for substantially the reasons advanced in the government's 
     opposition, that movant's motion under 28 U.S.C. s 2255 is 
     denied;  and it is
     
          FURTHER ORDERED, that C.A. No. 97-1783 is dismissed 
     with prejudice.

United States v. Feuver, Criminal No. 96-397 (TPJ), Civil Action 
No. 97-1783 (D.D.C. Sep. 28, 1998).

from the Order Dated September 28, 1998" asking the court 
to issue the certificate dated nunc pro tunc.  On May 13, 
1999 the district court issued a certificate of appealability 
dated nunc pro tunc October 5, 1998.  See United States v. 
Feuver, Criminal No. 96-397 (TPJ) (D.D.C. May 13, 1999).  
On May 21, 1999 Feuver, through counsel, filed a notice of 
intent to appeal the September 28, 1998 order (Appeal No. 
99-3071).  Meanwhile, on May 12, 1999 Feuver himself filed a 
notice of appeal of the April 29, 1999 order denying the April 
27, 1999 motion (Appeal No. 99-3065).  On June 4, 1999, 
pursuant to Feuver's pro se motion, No. 99-3065 was consoli-
dated with No. 99-3071.

     On July 13, 1999 the government moved to dismiss No. 99-
3071 for lack of jurisdiction and sought summary affirmance 
in No. 99-3065.  A motions panel of this court denied the 
motion for summary affirmance, referred the motion to dis-
miss to the merits panel and appointed an amicus curiae to 
argue the issues on Feuver's behalf.  See United States v. 
Feuver, No. 99-3065 (consolidated with No. 99-3071) (D.C. 
Cir. Oct. 14, 1999).  The motions panel directed the parties to 
address whether Rule 58 applies to this Section 2255 proceed-
ing and, if so, whether the order entered by the district court 
satisfies the requirements of Rule 58.  The panel also 
brought to the parties' attention Kidd v. District of Columbia 
(No. 98-7075), a case then pending before the court involving 
the application of Rule 58.

     Feuver's pro se briefs failed to comply with the briefing 
schedule and on February 17, 2000 the consolidated cases 
were dismissed for failure to prosecute.  See United States v. 
Feuver, No. 99-3065 (consolidated with No. 99-3071) (D.C. 
Cir. Feb. 17, 2000).  On April 25, 2000, however, the court 
vacated its February 17, 2000 order and decided that the 
cases should proceed based only on the arguments presented 
in the amicus brief.  See United States v. Feuver, No. 99-
3065 (consolidated with No. 99-3071) (D.C. Cir. Apr. 25, 
2000).  The cases are now before us on the merits.3

__________
     3 As noted supra, our April 25, 2000 order permitted the cases to 
proceed only on the basis of the amicus briefs.  See United States 
v. Feuver, No. 99-3065 (consolidated with No. 99-3071) (D.C. Cir. 
Apr. 25, 2000).  Because the amicus brief advances no arguments 

                          II. DISCUSSION

     Rule 4(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 
provides that "[w]hen the United States . . . is a party, the 
notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days 
after the judgment or order appealed from is entered."  Fed. 
R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  It is well settled that the time limits 
set out in the Rule are "mandatory and jurisdictional."  
Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 264 
(1978);  Moore v. South Carolina Labor Bd., 100 F.3d 162, 163 
(D.C. Cir. 1996) ("In general, the time limit established by 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) for noting an appeal 
of an order of the district court is mandatory and jurisdiction-
al.").  Thus, resolution of this case turns on whether Feuver's 
notice of appeal was timely.

     The amicus offers two alternative theories to support the 
timeliness of the appeal.  First, the amicus submits that the 
district court's September 28, 1998 order failed to comply 
with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 
therefore the time for filing a notice of appeal has not yet 
begun to run.  Second, the amicus contends that on May 13, 
1999 the district court, by granting a certificate of appealabili-
ty nunc pro tunc, extended Feuver's time to file an appeal 
pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6) of the Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure.  We find both arguments unpersuasive.

     As noted above, Rule 4(a)(1)(B) requires that an appeal be 
taken "within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed 
from is entered."  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Rule 4(a)(7) 
explains that a "judgment or order is entered for purposes of 
this Rule 4(a) when it is entered in compliance with Rules 58 
and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."  Fed. R. 
App. P. 4(a)(7).  Rule 58 in turn provides that "[e]very 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.  A 
judgment is effective only when so set forth . . . ."  Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 58.  Thus, in order to start the clock on a party's right 

__________
regarding No. 99-3065, we deem all appealable issues in No. 99-
3065 abandoned.  See Terry v. Reno, 101 F.3d 1412, 1415 (D.C. Cir. 
1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1264 (1997). Accordingly, we discuss 
only the issues raised in No. 99-3071.

to appeal, the district court must enter a judgment that 
complies with Rule 58.

     Earlier in this litigation, there was a question whether the 
requirements of Rule 58 apply to a Section 2255 proceeding.  
See United States v. Feuver, No. 99-3065 (consolidated with 
No. 99-3071) (D.C. Cir. Oct. 14, 1999).  The government no 
longer disputes the applicability of Rule 58.4  What is disput-
ed, however, is whether the order entered by the district 
court here, see supra note 2, complies with the "separate 
document" requirement of Rule 58.

     The government argues that the district court order satis-
fies Rule 58 as the Rule was interpreted in Kidd v. District of 
Columbia, 206 F.3d 35 (D.C. Cir.), reh'g en banc denied, 214 
F.3d 179 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 69 U.S.L.W. 3281 (U.S. 
Jan. 8, 2001) (No. 00-544).  In Kidd, we held that an order 
containing one citation to legal authority and one sentence 
explaining the district court's reasoning conformed to Rule 
58's "straightjacket."  Id. at 39 ("Our decision in Diamond 
itself endorses decisions of other circuits allowing inclusion of 
at least one citation to legal authority and at least a one-
sentence explanation of the court's reasoning.");  id. ("Al-
though our single-citation, single-sentence standard for Rule 
58 may well seem arbitrary, . . . we think it most proper to 
follow Diamond's analysis.").  Here, argues the government, 
the order contains only one sentence explaining the court's 
reasoning and one citation and therefore complies with Kidd.  
We agree.

     The amicus contends that the order is distinguishable from 
Kidd because it "makes legal findings regarding a claim's 
substantive merits."  Reply Brief of Amicus Curiae at 1.  
The amicus's argument is not compelling.  In Kidd, the 
district court order addressed the merits of the plaintiff's 
argument and concluded that the plaintiff " 'does not set forth 
any arguments that would cause the Court to reject Magis-
trate Judge Robinson's Report and Recommendation.' "  

__________
     4 Because the government concedes the issue, we need not decide 
whether compliance with Rule 58 is required in all Section 2255 
proceedings.

Kidd, 206 F.3d at 38-39 (quoting from district court order).  
Thus, because there is no meaningful distinction between 
Kidd and this case, the district court order complies with the 
separate document requirement of Rule 58 and the time for 
appeal started running on October 21, 1998 when the district 
court order was entered.  See Kidd, 206 F.3d at 39.  Conse-
quently, because the notice of appeal was filed more than 60 
days after the entry of judgment, the appeal is untimely.

     The amicus, relying on Rule 4(a)(6) of the Federal Rules of 
Appellate Procedure, offers another argument to sidestep the 
timeliness issue.5  The argument runs as follows:  (1) in light 
of the convention that a pro se plaintiff's motions are con-
strued liberally, Feuver's "Motion for Determination of Sta-
tus" is properly construed as a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen 
the time to file an appeal;  (2) the district court construed the 
motion in this way;  (3) on May 13, 1999 the district court 
issued a certificate of appealability dated nunc pro tunc 
October 5, 1998, in effect granting Feuver's motion to reopen 
the time to file an appeal;  (4) Feuver filed an appeal on May 
21, 1999 which was within the 14-day period permitted by 
Rule 4(a)(6);  (5) therefore, Feuver's appeal is timely.  The 
argument, although deft, is without merit.

     Given the 180-day requirement of Rule 4(a)(6), see Fed. R. 
App. P. 4(a)(6)(A), the only motion eligible for consideration 
under the Rule is Feuver's "Motion for Determination of 
__________
     5 Rule 4(a)(6) provides:
          Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.  The district court 
     may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days 
     after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if 
     all the following conditions are satisfied:
     
           (A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment 
          or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party 
          receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier;
          
           (B) the court finds that the moving party was entitled to 
          notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be 
          appealed but did not receive the notice from the district 
          court or any party within 21 days after entry;  and
          
           (C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.
        Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6).

Status."  Counsel's April 27, 1999 motion to set aside the 
September 28, 1998 order came too late--it was filed after the 
180-day period had expired.  But, even under the most 
charitable reading of Feuver's "Motion for Determination of 
Status," we simply cannot see how the motion can be inter-
preted as a motion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.  
All Feuver sought in his motion was to obtain a copy of the 
order.6  The motion does not even mention the word "appeal" 
from which the district court could have concluded a Rule 
4(a)(6) request was before it.7  Nor does the district court's 
response to the "Motion for Determination of Status" indicate 
that the district court treated it as such.  The district court 
merely directed the Clerk of Court to send Feuver another 
copy of the September 28, 1998 order.  Finally, the May 13, 
1999 certificate of appealability was issued in response to the 
May 10, 1999 request by Briley and does not refer to Feu-
ver's Motion for Determination of Status nor does it mention 
Rule 4(a)(6).  In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Rule 
4(a)(6) does not save Feuver's untimely appeal.

__________
     6 According to the Motion for Determination of Status, on Febru-
ary 2, 1999 Feuver inquired of the Clerk of Court about his case.  
In response, the Clerk forwarded Feuver an updated docket state-
ment showing that the 2255 motion had been denied with prejudice.  
On March 1, 1999 Feuver again inquired of the Clerk, "requesting 
an order."  Appendix to Brief of Amicus Curiae in Support of 
Appellant at 199.  After receiving no response to the second 
inquiry, Feuver filed his Motion for Determination of Status.

     7 Thus, the amicus's reliance on cases in which courts have 
construed pro se motions as Rule 4(a)(6) motions is unavailing.  
Unlike here, in the cases cited, the pro se motion made clear that 
the court was asked to decide a question about the timeliness of the 
appeal.  See, e.g., Sanders v. United States, 113 F.3d 184, 186 (11th 
Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (construing late-filed notice of appeal as 
motion to reopen under Rule 4(a)(6));  Ogden v. San Juan County, 
32 F.3d 452, 454 (10th Cir. 1994) (construing pro se notice of appeal 
as motion to reopen where notice of appeal proffered excuse for 
lack of timeliness), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1090 (1995).

     In sum, Feuver's appeal came too late and we are without 
jurisdiction to proceed further.  The appeal is therefore

                                                                      Dismissed.
