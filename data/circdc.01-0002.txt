     Before:  Henderson, Rogers and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson:  The Association of American 
Railroads (AAR) and Union Pacific Railroad Company (Union 
Pacific) challenge a Surface Transportation Board (STB) rule-
making which altered the Board's guidelines for finding that a 
particular rail carrier enjoys "market dominance," a statutory 
prerequisite to hearing a railroad rate challenge.  Before the 
rulemaking the guidelines required that the Board, in making 
the market dominance determination, consider both "direct" 
competition to the challenged carrier, by shippers that would 
carry the same products (whether by rail or otherwise) from 
the same location to the same destination, and "indirect" 
competition using alternate routes (geographic competition) 
or different products (product competition).  The challenged 
STB decision eliminated consideration of indirect competition.  
Petitioner AAR and Union Pacific1 contend that the statutory 
definition of "market dominance" in 49 U.S.C. s 10709(a) 
requires that the Board consider both direct and indirect 
competition.2  Although we reject the petitioners' construc-
tion of section 10709(a), we nonetheless remand for the Board 
to reconsider its decision in light of the strong language 
favoring rail deregulation set out in 49 U.S.C. s 10101(1).

                                I.

     Before 1976 the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or 
Commission) was charged with examining every railroad ship-
ping rate to ensure that it was "just and reasonable."  See 49 
U.S.C. s 1(5) (1976).  In 1976, however, the Congress enacted 

__________
     1 The consolidated petitions filed by United Transportation 
Union-Illinois Legislative Board in Nos. 00-1047 and 00-1082 were 
denied in a judgment issued December 12, 2000.

     2 On January 11, 2001 the court granted Union Pacific's motion to 
withdraw its additional challenge to the guidelines as impermissibly 
retroactive.

the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, Pub. 
L. No. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31 (4R Act), which largely deregulated 
railroad rates so that thenceforth the ICC was authorized to 
examine a rail carrier's service rate only if it first affirmative-
ly found that the carrier had "market dominance over such 
service."  Pub. L. No. 94-210, s 202(b), 90 Stat. at 35.  The 
4R Act expressly directed the ICC to "establish, by rule, 
standards and procedures for determining ... whether and 
when a carrier possesses market dominance over a service 
rendered or to be rendered at a particular rate or rates," such 
rules to be "designed to provide for a practical determination 
without administrative delay."  Id. s 202(d), 90 Stat. at 35.  
Pursuant to the Congress's directive, the ICC promulgated 
"Special Procedures for Making Findings of Market Domi-
nance," which required that in making the market dominance 
determination the ICC consider only "direct" competition 
using the same point of departure and the same destination 
by other rail carriers ("intramodal competition") or by non-
rail transport ("intermodal competition").  See 353 I.C.C. 874, 
modified, 355 I.C.C. 12 (1976).  During the rulemaking, the 
ICC expressly declined to require consideration of "indirect" 
product competition (using a different product subject to a 
different rate) or geographic competition (using a different 
departure-point or destination).  353 I.C.C. at 904-07.  In 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. ICC, 580 F.2d 623, 623-
34 (D.C. Cir. 1978), this court upheld the Board's decision to 
exclude geographic and product competition.

     In early 1980 the ICC proposed a rulemaking to, inter alia, 
add indirect competition to its market dominance calculus.  
See Ex Parte No. 320 (Sub-No. 1), Rail Market Dominance 
and Related Considerations, 45 Fed. Reg. 3353, 3357 
(s 1109.1(g)(4)(iv) (Jan. 17, 1980)).  While the rulemaking was 
pending, the Congress enacted the Staggers Act to further 
deregulate rail transport.  Pub. L. No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895 
(1980).3  The Staggers Act retained the requirement of a 

__________
     3 Significant to further deregulation, but not to this case, the 
Staggers Act established a conclusive presumption of no market 

market dominance finding as a prerequisite to regulation as 
well as the existing statutory definition of the term and 
directed that the ICC "commence a proceeding for purposes 
of determining whether, and to what extent, product competi-
tion should be considered ... to determine the reasonable-
ness of rail carrier rates."  Id. s 205(a)(1), 94 Stat. at 1905.  
The Congress explained, however, that this directive was not 
to "be construed as altering the meaning, use, or interpreta-
tion by the Commission, the courts, or any party of the term 
'market dominance,' as defined in section 10709(a) of title 49, 
United States Code."  Id. s 205(a)(3)(B), 94 Stat. at 1906.  
Following the Congress's directive, the ICC instituted a new 
rulemaking and concluded that both product competition and 
geographic competition should be considered in making the 
market dominance determination.4  Ex Parte No. 320 (Sub-
No. 2), Market Dominance Determinations and Consider-
ation of Product Competition, 365 I.C.C. 118 (June 24, 1981).  
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Board's deter-
mination.  See Western Coal Traffic League v. United States, 
719 F.2d 772 (5th Cir. 1983) (en banc), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 
953 (1984).

     In 1995 the Congress enacted the Interstate Commerce 
Commission Termination Act, Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 
803 (1995), which abolished the ICC and vested in the newly 
fashioned STB, inter alia, the ICC's authority to regulate rail 
transportation rates.  The ICC Termination Act left the 
statutory market dominance provisions intact.

     On May 5, 1998 the Board published its "Proposal to 
Eliminate Product and Geographic Competition From Consid-
eration in Market Dominance Determinations."  63 Fed. Reg. 
24,588 (1998).  After receiving comments the Board issued a 
decision dated July 1, 1999, announcing that geographic and 
product competition would no longer be considered in deter-

__________
dominance when a rate generated revenues below a certain thresh-
old.  See Pub. L. No. 96-448, s 202, 94 Stat. 1900.

     4 Although the Staggers Act directive mentioned only "product 
competition," the statutory definition of the term was "such that it 
encompasses geographic competition as well."  365 I.C.C. at 127.

mining market dominance.  Ex Parte No. 627, Market Domi-
nance Determinations--Product and Geographic Competi-
tion (Dec. 21, 1998) (STB Dec.).  The Board reasoned that 
the statute does not itself require their consideration and that 
the Board "can more expeditiously, efficiently and effectively 
carry out [its] mandated functions by limiting the market 
dominance inquiry to the scope expressly required by the 
statute."  STB Dec. at 10, 12.  The Board noted that "the 
time and resources" spent on indirect competition evidence 
and analysis, by both the parties and the Board, "can be 
inordinate."  Id. at 12.  The Board also determined the 
change would benefit shippers, which would not be so reluc-
tant to challenge rates if they did not have to litigate product 
and geographic competition, and that it would not substantial-
ly injure rail carriers, which, once a rate was challenged, 
could still rely on indirect competition to establish the rate's 
reasonableness.  Id. at 12-14.  AAR and Union Pacific peti-
tioned for reconsideration which the Board denied on July 19, 
1999.  Ex Parte No. 627, Market Dominance Determina-
tions--Product and Geographic Competition (1999) (Recon-
sideration Denial).

                               II.

     The petitioners first contend that the statutory definition of 
"market dominance" in section 10709(a) requires the Board to 
consider indirect product and geographic competition in de-
termining market dominance.  We disagree.

     The result of the statutory evolution outlined above is that 
now "a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Board ... may establish any rate for 
transportation or other service provided by the rail carrier" 
"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (d) of [49 U.S.C. s 10701] 
and unless a rate is prohibited by a provision of [part A of 
Subtitle iv of title 49]".  49 U.S.C. s 10701(c).  The subsec-
tion (d) exception provides:  "If the Board determines, under 
section 10707 of this title, that a rail carrier has market 
dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate 
applies, the rate established by such carrier for such trans-

portation must be reasonable."  Id. s 10701(d)(1).  Section 
10707, in turn, provides that if a rate is challenged, "the 
Board shall determine whether the rail carrier proposing the 
rate has market dominance over the transportation to which 
the rate applies," 49 U.S.C. s 10707(b), and "[w]hen the 
Board finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or 
defending a rate for transportation has market dominance 
over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then 
determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reason-
able maximum for that transportation," id. s 10707(c).  Fi-
nally, and most significantly here, section 10709(a) defines 
"market dominance" to "mean[ ] an absence of effective com-
petition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation 
for the transportation to which a rate applies."  Id. 
s 10709(a).  The meaning of the word "competition" is the 
heart of this dispute.

     The petitioners maintain that "competition" means all com-
petition, whether direct or indirect.  The Board, on the other 
hand, construed the term to mean only direct competition 
because the statutory language mentions only "competition 
from other rail carriers or modes of transportation for the 
transportation to which a rate applies," that is, competition 
"for moving the same product between the same origin and 
destination points."  STB Dec. at 10.  We conclude the 
Board's interpretation comports with section 10709(a)'s defini-
tion.

     In Atchison the ICC advanced, and we endorsed, the same 
construction of the definition the Board adopted below.  
There we explained:

     The Act defines "market dominance" as the "absence of 
     effective competition from other carriers or modes of 
     transportation, for the traffic or movement to which a 
     rate applies...."  Section 202(b) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. 
     s 1(5)(c)(i).  As a matter of strict logic, the phrase "for 
     the traffic or movement to which a rate applies" would 
     seem to exclude from consideration competition that 
     manifests itself in the form of "traffic" or "movement" 
     other than that to which the rate in question applies.  
     
     Shipment of a product to another geographical location, 
     or shipment of a different product, would certainly ap-
     pear to involve "traffic" or "movement" other than that 
     to which the rate applies.  This is essentially the statuto-
     ry argument advanced by the Commission.  Interim 
     Report at 54, J.A. 778.  The construction may appear to 
     some as an attempt to attribute excessive significance to 
     a terse statutory clause.  But we cannot say that it is an 
     unreasonable reading, particularly in light of the clear 
     emphasis placed by the Act upon efficiency and practical-
     ity....  The Commission's reading of the statutory defi-
     nition of market dominance insures that the highly com-
     plex issues of geographic and product competition will 
     not create delay in the determination of market domi-
     nance, even in the rebuttal stage of the proceeding.  We 
     believe there is sufficient basis in the statutory language 
     and purpose to merit our deferral to the Commission's 
     view.
     
580 F.2d at 634.  But see Western Coal Traffic League, 719 
F.2d at 772 n.10 (reviewing the same interpretation, court 
stated it was "hesitant to rely heavily upon a vague congres-
sional use of prepositions in determining the extent of the 
ICC's jurisdiction to review rail rates").  Since Atchison, the 
Congress altered slightly the language of the statutory defini-
tion, substituting the word "transportation" for the phrase 
"traffic or movement," see Pub. L. No. 95-473, 92 Stat. 1337, 
1382 (1978) [10706], but the change does not affect the 
reasonableness of the Board's interpretation.5  The language 
may still be read to refer only to direct competition--which is, 
technically, the only competition for the particular transporta-
tion (of a single commodity by a single route) to which a 
specific rate applies.  Further, the court's prediction in Atchi-
son that this reading would prevent administrative delay, 

__________
     5 The change occurred in a statutory recodification intended to be 
effected "without substantive change."  Pub. L. No. 95-473, 92 Stat. 
1337, 1337.  Before the recodification the 4R Act defined "market 
dominance" as "an absence of effective competition from other 
carriers or modes of transportation, for the traffic or movement to 
which a rate applies."  Atchison, 580 F.2d at 627.

which would inevitably result from litigating "the highly 
complex issues of geographic and product competition," has 
been confirmed by the Commission's and the Board's experi-
ence since the guidelines were changed to include indirect 
competition in 1981.  See Board Dec. at 10-11 (describing, 
with examples, extensive discovery generated in litigating 
product and geographic competition costs).  Thus, the 
Board's construction of the statutory definition furthers its 
statutory mandate to "establish procedures to ensure expedi-
tious handling of challenges to the reasonableness of railroad 
rates" which "procedures shall include appropriate measures 
for avoiding delay in the discovery and evidentiary phases of 
such proceedings."  49 U.S.C. s 10704(d).  For these reasons, 
we conclude the Board's interpretation of section 10709(a)'s 
definition is reasonable and, considered in isolation, permissi-
ble.  See Western Coal Traffic League v. STB, 216 F.3d 1168 
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (court will "defer to the Board's interpreta-
tion of the statute so long as it is 'based on a permissible 
construction of the statute' ") (quoting Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. 
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 
(1984)).  Nevertheless, our review does not end there.

     The petitioners contend it was arbitrary and capricious for 
the Board to construe section 10709(a) as it did without 
considering the policy set out in the Staggers Act preamble.  
We agree.  The preamble states:

     In regulating the railroad industry, it is the policy of the 
United States Government--

     (1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competi-
     tion and the demand for services to establish reasonable 
     rates for transportation by rail
     
     ....
     
49 U.S.C. s 10101(1) (emphasis added).  The italicized lan-
guage, so forcefully expressed, manifests a preference for 
market-based rather than regulatory rate setting.  Yet the 
Board did not address this important language in either its 
initial decision or its decision on reconsideration, as it ought 

to have done.6  See Wyoming Outdoor Council v. United 
States Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("[A]l-
though the language in the preamble of a statute is 'not an 
operative part of the statute,' it may aid in achieving a 
'general understanding' of the statute.") (quoting Association 
of Am. R.Rs. v. Costle, 562 F.2d 1310, 1316 (D.C. Cir. 1977));  
see also Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. United States, 704 F.2d 
373, 375-76 (7th Cir. 1983) ("[T]he national transportation 
policy for railroads, 49 U.S.C. s 10101a [now s 10101], ... is 
to guide the Commission in applying the rail provisions of the 
Interstate Commerce Act.").  Accordingly we remand this 
case to the Board to weigh the effect, if any, the quoted 
preamble language has on the statutory definition of market 
dominance set out in 49 U.S.C. s 10709(a).

                                                                 So ordered.

reliance on market-set rates."  See Reconsideration Denial at 9-10.
