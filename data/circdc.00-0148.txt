     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge;  Randolph and Garland, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  This is an appeal from the 
judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint of 
Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc.  The case arises under s 313 
of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know 
Act ("EPCRA"), 42 U.S.C. s 11023.  EPCRA requires cer-
tain types of facilities that "manufactured," "processed" or 
"otherwise used" listed "toxic chemicals" in amounts exceed-
ing specified thresholds to report "releases" of these chemi-
cals by July 1 of each year to the Environmental Protection 
Agency.  Id. s 11023(b)(1).  EPA uses the information to 
administer a "toxic release inventory" program pursuant to 
EPCRA.  The program makes the toxic release information 
public. Although the toxic release inventory program original-
ly applied only to manufacturing facilities, EPA extended it 
by regulation to several other industry groups, including 
metal mining.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 23,834 (1997).  Barrick 
mines gold and other precious metals in Nevada.  The compa-
ny alleges that in applying the program to mining, EPA in 
fact revised the program;  that its revisions were substantive;  
that they were not made through rulemaking, as they should 
have been;  and that the revisions were made instead through 
statements in "rulemaking preambles" and in detailed di-
rectives issued in the form of "guidance" and a letter.  Brief 
of Appellant Barrick at 4.  On EPA's motion the district 
court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and 
because it was not ripe.  The court issued no written opinion.

     EPCRA contains no judicial review provision.  Barrick 
therefore invoked the district court's general federal question 
jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. s 1331) and sought, pursuant to the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. ss 701-706, and 28 
U.S.C. s 2201), a declaratory judgment that the three EPA 
actions were contrary to law.  As to jurisdiction, the question 
is whether Barrick has challenged "final agency action" with-
in the meaning of the APA, see 5 U.S.C. s 704.  As to 
ripeness, we must determine whether Barrick, like the drug 

manufacturers in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 
136 (1967), but unlike the cosmetics companies in Toilet 
Goods Ass'n v. Gardner, 387 U.S.158, 164 (1967), must change 
its conduct or risk costly sanctions, and whether the issues 
presented in Barrick's complaint are suitable for review at 
this time.  See Clean Air Implementation Project v. EPA, 
150 F.3d 1200, 1204-05 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

     1. Barrick claimed that for certain mining operations, 
including its own, EPA had revised the so-called de minimis 
exception set forth in 40 C.F.R. s 372.38(a) without conduct-
ing a rulemaking.  Barrick moves waste rock.  The rock 
contains trace concentrations of listed substances--toxic 
chemicals--including copper, nickel, silver and other metal-
bearing minerals.  Under EPA's de minimis regulation, if a 
toxic chemical in a mixture amounts to less than 1% (or in the 
case of a carcinogen, less than 0.1%) the substance is not 
counted as having been released and does not count toward 
the manufacturing, processing or "otherwise used" threshold.  
Id.  In EPA's "Metal Mining Facilities" guidance, posted on 
EPA's website in January 1999,1 the agency stated that the 
chemicals in waste rock are not eligible for this de minimis 
exception because waste rock is not "manufactured, processed 
or otherwise used."  Office of Pollution Prevention and Tox-
ics, EPA, EPCRA Section 313 Industry Guidance:  Metal 
Mining Facilities 3-28 (Jan. 1999) [hereafter "1999 Guid-
ance"].

     Counsel for EPA admitted at oral argument that EPA's 
position on the application of the de minimis exception to 
waste rock is final.  If Barrick does not conform to EPA's 
view in fulfilling its reporting obligation it will be subject to 
an enforcement action and fines.  Even without counsel's 
concession, the finality of EPA's position is clear enough.  

__________
     1 The guidance went through several iterations from 1997 to 
1999, some of which were published in the Federal Register.  See, 
e.g., 62 Fed. Reg. 63,548 (1997).  According to Barrick, the January 
1999 version is "comprehensive and authoritative" and represents 
the agency's principal set of reporting instructions for mining 
companies. Brief of Appellant Barrick at 5.

That the issuance of a guideline or guidance may constitute 
final agency action has been settled in this circuit for many 
years.  See, e.g., Better Gov't Ass'n v. Department of State, 
780 F.2d 86, 92-96 (D.C. Cir. 1986);  Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. 
EPA, 801 F.2d 430, 435 & n.7, 436 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  In Better 
Government we rejected the proposition that if an agency 
labels its action an "informal" guideline it may thereby escape 
judicial review under the APA.  780 F.2d at 93.  In Ciba-
Geigy we held that a letter from an agency official stating the 
agency's position and threatening enforcement action unless 
the company complied constituted final agency action.  801 
F.2d at 436-39, 438 n.9.  In Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 
208 F.3d 1015, 1020-23 (D.C. Cir. 2000), we held again that a 
guidance document reflecting a settled agency position and 
having legal consequences for those subject to regulation may 
constitute "final agency action" for the purpose of judicial 
review.  For finality to be found in these cases two conditions 
had to be satisfied:  "First, the action must mark the 'consum-
mation' of the agency's decisionmaking process, Chicago & 
Southern Airlines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 
113 (1948)--it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocu-
tory nature.  And second, the action must be one by which 
'rights or obligations have been determined,' or from which 
'legal consequences will flow,' Port of Boston Marine Termi-
nal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 
(1970)."  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997).  Here 
there is no doubt that EPA will refuse to apply the de 
minimis exception to Barrick's waste rock and that its refus-
al to do so has legal consequences--namely, that Barrick is 
bound to keep track of its movement of waste rock and report 
the movements as releases of toxic substances.2

     As against this EPA contended at oral argument that the 
1999 Guidance changed nothing;  that EPA had already taken 
the position Barrick complains about in the preamble to the 

__________
     2 EPA's 1999 metals mining guidance commanded:  "you must 
report ...  the waste rock."  1999 Guidance, at 3-28.  Other 
portions of the 1999 Guidance, not challenged in this case, are 
framed as recommendations.

rule subjecting the mining industry to the toxic reporting 
program;  and that Barrick should have aimed its complaint 
at the preamble, but had not done so. There are three reasons 
for rejecting this line of reasoning.3  First, EPA never made 
the argument in its brief in this court.  See, e.g., Carducci v. 
Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  It did not even 
cite the page or pages in the preamble that supposedly 
support its position.  Second, Barrick did indeed challenge 
EPA positions expressed in the preambles (Complaint p 25;  
Brief at 4) and did so in a timely fashion because no statute of 
limitations applied.  Third, we have recognized that final 
agency action may result "from a series of agency pronounce-
ments rather than a single edict."  Ciba-Geigy, 801 F.2d at 
435 n.7.  Hence, a preamble plus a guidance plus an enforce-
ment letter from EPA could crystallize an agency position 
into final agency action within APA s 704's meaning.  Fairly 
read, this is what Barrick's complaint alleges.4

__________
     3 EPA's brief contained a quite different argument--namely 
that the 1999 Guidance was not final because it was not "binding" 
and it was not binding because it merely explained "EPA's current 
view of how the statutory and regulatory requirements of the [toxic 
reporting] program apply to the metal mining industry and do not 
impose any binding new requirements."  Brief for Federal Apellees 
at 16.  It appears that EPA has abandoned this line of argument in 
light of our intervening decision in Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA.  
If it has not, if EPA still wishes us to consider the argument despite 
the quite different position it took at oral argument, we reject it for 
the reasons given in Appalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1020-23.  
There is not the slightest doubt that EPA directed regulated 
entities to comply with the 1999 Guidance regarding their treatment 
of waste rock, see supra note 1, and the other two interpretations 
Barrick protests--conversion of one metal compound into another 
within the same compound category, and impurities in dore, see 
infra pp. 6-8.

     4 In a case (unlike this one) in which our jurisdiction was 
restricted to reviewing final "regulations," we held that a statement 
in a preamble to a proposed rule could not be reviewed.  See 
Florida Power & Light Co. v. EPA, 145 F.3d 1414, 1418-20 (D.C. 
Cir. 1998);  see also Molycorp, Inc. v. EPA, 197 F.3d 543 (D.C. Cir. 
1999).

     We also agree with Barrick that this aspect of its case is 
ripe for judicial review.  The questions presented are purely 
legal.5  Nothing we can imagine happening would bring the 
issues into greater focus or assist in determining them. And 
there is certainly the prospect of hardship to Barrick.  Its 
only alternative to obtaining judicial review now is to violate 
EPA's directives, refuse to report releases involving waste 
rock, and then defend an enforcement proceeding on the 
grounds it raises here.  In that respect the case is indistin-
guishable from Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. EPA, 801 F.2d at 438-39, 
in which we held an analogous claim ripe for judicial review.

     2. Barrick's second claim deals with whether it is "manu-
facturing" a "toxic chemical" when, in the course of extracting 
gold from ore, trace amounts of naturally occurring metal 
compounds change form, generally from metal sulfides to 
metal oxides.  In the 1999 metals mining guidance, EPA 
announced that it would treat these changes as the manufac-
turing of toxic chemicals, a reportable event.  See 1999 Guid-
ance, at 3-11.  Barrick objects that the 1999 Guidance is 
inconsistent with s 313(c) of the statute and 40 C.F.R. 
s 372.65(c), which do not permit the agency to treat as 
"manufacturing" the conversion of one metal compound into 
another within the same compound category.  No further 
detail is needed to understand why there is final agency 
action here and why this claim is ripe.  Here too, EPA 
counsel conceded at oral argument that the position on this 
subject expressed in the 1999 Guidance is the agency's final 
position.  The 1999 Guidance itself (at 3-11) says just that:

     Metal mining facilities should be aware of chemical con-
     versions that may take place during beneficiation.  The 
     following types of conversions constitute manufacturing:
     
__________
     5 Barrick claimed not only that EPA had issued a substantive 
rule without engaging in rulemaking but also that it had misinter-
preted its regulation (40 C.F.R. s 372.38(a)) and had acted arbi-
trarily by saying, with respect to the de minimis exception, that 
waste rock is not manufactured, but saying elsewhere that all 
"chemicals which exist in nature have been 'manufactured' at some 
point," 62 Fed. Reg. at 23,857.

          .  Conversion of one metal compound to another 
          within the same compound category.  For example, a 
          lead mine may convert galena (lead sulfide in ore) to 
          lead oxide during beneficiation.
          
Thus, if Barrick refuses to abide by the 1999 Guidance, the 
company will be subject to an enforcement action.

     3. Barrick's third and last claim relates to the fact that its 
mine produces metal bars--dore--that are gold and silver but 
also contain tiny amounts of naturally occurring elements and 
compounds from rock, compounds and elements that EPA 
lists as "toxic chemicals."  Under the statute, "the term 
process means the preparation of a toxic chemical, after its 
manufacture, for distribution in commerce."  42 U.S.C. 
s 11023(b)(1)(C)(ii).  Barrick thus believes that a "toxic 
chemical" cannot be "processed" unless it has first been 
"manufactured."  From this it concludes that in producing its 
dore it has not processed toxic chemicals and therefore has no 
reporting obligation under the statute.  EPA's opposite con-
clusion, Barrick contends, is embodied in its statement in the 
preamble to the 1997 rule expanding coverage to the mining 
industry, in the 1999 Guidance and in a letter, dated March 
18, 1999, from the Chief of EPA's Toxic Release Inventory 
Branch to another mining company.  The preamble states 
that the term "manufacture" is not limited to human activity.  
"Manufacture" of a toxic chemical includes its "production" 
and "EPA interprets 'production' to include creation."  62 
Fed. Reg. at 23,857.  Thus, according to the preamble "chem-
icals which exist in nature have been 'manufactured' at some 
point."  Id. The 1999 Guidance states the same conclusion 
without giving the reasoning:

     Non-Target Metals and Metal Compounds.  When pro-
     cessing the target metals and metal compounds at your 
     facility, the ore you are beneficiating may also contain 
     other non-target EPCRA Section 313 metals and metal 
     compounds.  If any portion of these non-target metals 
     and metal compounds remain in the metal concentrate 
     distributed into commerce, you must consider them to-
     ward the processing threshold of 25,000 pounds.  If the 
     
     EPCRA Section 313 chemicals are completely removed 
     from your product prior to distribution into commerce, 
     the chemicals are not considered processed and do not 
     have to be considered toward the processing threshold.
     
1999 Guidance, at 3-15.  The March 18, 1999, "guidance" 
letter from the branch chief also states the same conclusion. 
In order to comply with EPA's interpretation, Barrick claims 
that in 1999 it wound up reporting that it had " 'processed' 
the naturally occurring metal impurities that it could not 
completely remove from its dore."  Reply Brief of Appellant 
Barrick at 21.

     Nothing in EPA's brief or in its oral argument indicates 
that the EPA's position on this subject is tentative.  The 
March letter is firm and conclusive, as is the 1999 Guidance.  
Both state what must be done to comply with EPA's toxic 
release inventory program.  Legal consequences flow from 
the position expressed--Barrick must keep records and re-
port to EPA unless it wishes to risk an enforcement action.  
That the agency action is embodied in interpretative state-
ments in a rulemaking preamble, in a guidance document, and 
in a letter from a branch chief is not disqualifying.  As we 
have said, the final agency action in Ciba-Geigy, 801 F.2d at 
436 n.8, consisted of a "series of steps taken by EPA" 
culminating in a letter from an EPA official stating the 
agency's position.6  We have no doubt that EPA, in respond-
ing by letter to industry inquiries, assists companies in bring-
ing themselves into compliance.  But it scarcely follows that a 
company may not obtain judicial review of the agency's 
interpretation of the statute or regulation.  There is of course 
the matter of timing.  We have already decided that the first 
two objections Barrick raised are ripe for review and we see 
no basis for ruling any differently on this claim.  It too 
presents a pure question of law and withholding review has 
sufficient adverse effects on Barrick's business.

__________
     6 The final agency action in Her Majesty the Queen v. EPA, 912 
F.2d 1525, 1530-32 (D.C. Cir. 1990), consisted of a letter from an 
EPA official reiterating the agency's interpretation of a provision in 
the Clean Air Act.

     For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is 
reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

                                                      So ordered.
