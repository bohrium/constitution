     Before:  Sentelle, Randolph, and Garland, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.

     Per Curiam:  Mid-Mountain Foods, Inc., a Virginia whole-
sale grocer, petitions for review of an order of the National 
Labor Relations Board.  The Board cross-petitions for en-
forcement.

     On August 1, 1996, the Board supervised an election to 
determine whether Mid-Mountain's warehouse employees de-
sired to be represented by the United Food and Commercial 
Workers International Union, Local 400.  The union lost.  
After reviewing the actions and statements of Mid- 
Mountain's management, the Board found that the company 
had committed several unfair labor practices.  The Board 
therefore ordered another election and ordered the company 
to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices.

     Mid-Mountain asks us to set aside the portion of the 
Board's order requiring a new election.  We cannot consider 
this issue now.  We have repeatedly held that the Board's 
decision to hold another election is not a "final order."  
Therefore, judicial review is not yet available under the 
National Labor Relations Act.  See Adtranz ABB Daimler-
Benz Transp. v. NLRB, 253 F.3d 19, 24-25 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  
Gold Coast Rest. v. NLRB, 995 F.2d 257, 267 (D.C. Cir. 1993) 
(citing American Fed'n of Labor v. NLRB, 308 U.S. 401, 409 
(1940));  see also Hartz Mountain Corp. v. Dotson, 727 F.2d 
1308, 1310-12 (D.C. Cir. 1984);  International Union of Elec., 
Radio & Mach. Workers, Local 806 v. NLRB, 434 F.2d 473, 
482 (D.C. Cir. 1970).

     Mid-Mountain also claims that the Board's findings of 
unfair labor practices were unsupported.  The company rais-
es numerous evidentiary objections.  There is no need to go 
into these in detail.  Substantial evidence sustains the 
Board's decision that Mid-Mountain Foods committed unfair 
labor practices when its supervisors interrogated employees 
about their views on unionization, when company representa-

tives threatened harsher enforcement of company work rules 
(if the union won the election), when a supervisor suggested 
the company would fire union supporters, when the company 
sanctioned an employee for missing work to testify before the 
Board's Administrative Law Judge, and when the employer 
disseminated a pamphlet threatening to close the facility if 
the union won.  See, e.g., Purdue Farms v. NLRB, 144 F.3d 
830, 834-35 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

     We also sustain the Board's conclusion that Mid-Mountain 
violated s 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1), when it removed pro-
union material from the company's outdoor break area, while 
permitting anti-union literature to remain.  Once an employer 
allows employee speech in a specific area of company proper-
ty, the employer may not selectively censor the employees' 
union-related speech.  See Container Corp. of Am., 244 
N.L.R.B. 318, 318 n.2 (1979) (holding that once an employer 
permits use of its bulletin boards for employee postings, it 
may not discriminate against pro-union messages).  Cf. Hel-
ton v. NLRB, 656 F.2d 883 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (finding incum-
bent union committed an unfair labor practice when it re-
moved employee speech critical of union from bulletin boards 
where other employee speech was permitted).  When the 
employee break area is filled with literature of all sorts, an 
employer's selective removal of pro-union pamphlets conveys 
the unmistakable message of hostility toward unionization.

     In regard to another incident, the Administrative Law 
Judge concluded that Mid-Mountain did not selectively re-
move union literature from tables in a break area in mid-July 
1996.  See Mid-Mountain Foods, 332 N.L.R.B. No. 19, 2000 
WL 1390484, at *30 (Sept. 21, 2000).  The Board overturned 
this factual conclusion, crediting--so counsel for the Board 
explained at oral argument--the testimony of a Mid- 
Mountain employee that a supervisor had done just that.  
The company did not contest this particular finding of the 
Board, and we therefore will uphold it.

     It is unnecessary for us to consider the Board's alternative 
ground that the National Labor Relations Act required the 
company to allow pro-union literature to remain in break 

areas indefinitely unless the papers were "strewn about in an 
unsightly or hazardous manner," even if the company was 
throwing away all literature and trash in the area.  Mid-
Mountain Foods, 2000 WL 1390484, at *2.  The Board did 
not explain why an employee's "right to distribute" literature, 
see NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U.S. 322, 325-26 (1974);  
Republic Aviation v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 803 n.10 (1945), 
includes the right to use a company's break room as an 
extended distribution center, or why a company's practice of 
regularly cleaning out such areas, without discriminating 
between the type of material employees leave behind, should 
give rise to a violation of the Act.  Compare Mid-Mountain 
Foods, 2000 WL 1390484, at *2, with Container Corp. of Am., 
244 N.L.R.B. 318, 318 n.2 (1979);  The Heath Co., 196 
N.L.R.B. 134, 134-35 (1972);  Union Carbide Corp., 259 
N.L.R.B. 974, 980 (1981);  Mid-Mountain Foods, 2000 WL 
1390484, at *2 to *4.  We leave to another day the issues the 
Board's alternative holding presents.

     The petition for judicial review is denied.  The Board's 
cross-petition for enforcement is granted.
