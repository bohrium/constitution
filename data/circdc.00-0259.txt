     Before:  Williams, Randolph and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  Mohamed Rashed moved the 
district court to dismiss six of the nine counts of an indict-
ment charging him with terrorism.  He claimed that under 
the Double Jeopardy Clause his prior prosecution in Greece 
for related offenses foreclosed a prosecution in the United 
States.  Rashed recognized that the dual sovereignty doctrine 
normally renders the double jeopardy bar inapplicable in 
cases of prosecutions by different sovereigns.  But he invoked 
an exception overriding the dual sovereignty doctrine when 
one sovereign's prosecution is a "sham" for prosecution by the 
other.  See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 123-24 (1959).  
The district court denied the motion.  United States v. 
Rashed, 83 F. Supp. 2d 96 (D.D.C. 1999).

     We affirm.  In no reasonable sense of the word was 
Greece's prosecution of Rashed a sham.  Far from being 
controlled by the United States, the Greek trial occurred only 
because Greece rejected U.S. demands for Rashed's extradi-
tion, yet was subject to the requirement of Article 7 of the 
Montreal Convention to prosecute Rashed itself if it failed to 
extradite him.  Convention on Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, arts. 7-8, 
24 U.S.T. 565, 571 ("Montreal Convention").

                             *  *  *

     Rashed is charged with participating in various bombing 
enterprises around the world in violation of U.S. law.  The 
charges include placing a bomb on an August 11, 1982, Pan 
Am flight from Tokyo to Honolulu, killing one and wounding 
15 passengers.  Rashed is also charged with conspiring in the 
same month to place a bomb on a Pan Am aircraft in Rio de 
Janeiro, a bomb that luckily was discovered and removed 
safely.  The counts of the indictment at issue here, 1 and 3-7, 
all relate to the bomb on the Tokyo-Honolulu flight.

     At the request of the United States, Greek authorities 
detained an individual bearing a passport in the name of 

Mohammed Hamdan on May 30, 1988.  The individual was in 
fact Rashed, who here asserts--at the expense of his notion 
that Greece is a U.S. pawn--that the United States did not 
tell Greece of Hamdan's true identity for fear that otherwise 
Greece wouldn't have apprehended him.  After verifying 
Rashed's capture, the United States requested his extradition 
under its bilateral extradition treaty with Greece.  Treaty of 
Extradition between the United States and the Hellenic 
Republic, May 6, 1931, 47 Stat. 2185, as further interpreted 
by the Protocol, Sept. 2, 1937, 51 Stat. 357.  In May 1989 the 
Greek Supreme Court ruled that Rashed could be extradited 
on some but not all counts of the U.S. indictment.  Decision 
820/1989, Greek Supreme Court, Sixth Penal Section (May 12, 
1989).  But the Greek government delayed handing Rashed 
over to the United States and officially rejected the United 
States's extradition request in September 1990.  Instead 
Greece chose to pursue Article 7's alternative course, that of 
prosecuting Rashed itself.  Montreal Convention, art. 7, 24 
U.S.T. at 571.

     A Greek court found Rashed guilty of intentional homicide 
and placement of explosive devices in an aircraft, but acquit-
ted him of charges of illegal seizure of an aircraft and 
instigation of damage to aircraft.  Although sentenced to 15 
years in prison, he was released on December 5, 1996, after 
serving eight and a half years.  In the course of his travels 
away from Greece he was taken into custody and arrested by 
the FBI.

     In denying Rashed's motion to dismiss, the district court 
not only rejected Rashed's sham prosecution theory but also 
concluded that none of the charges satisfied the Blockburger 
test for determining when crimes stated in two charges 
constitute "the same offense."  Rashed, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 
103-04;  see Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 
(1932).  We affirm, but because we reject the sham prosecu-
tion theory we have no need to address the Blockburger issue.

                             *  *  *

     The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment 
provides that "[n]o person shall be subject for the same 

offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb."  The 
clause forecloses multiple prosecutions for the same offense 
by the same sovereign, but not ones by different sovereigns.  
Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82 (1985) (successive state-state 
prosecutions);  United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313 (1978) 
(successive Navajo tribal court-federal prosecutions);  Abbate 
v. United States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959) (successive state-federal 
prosecutions);  United States v. Rezaq, 134 F.3d 1121, 1128 
(D.C. Cir. 1998) (successive foreign-federal prosecutions).  
The exception for dual sovereignty flows from the under-
standing that every sovereign has the authority to punish 
infractions of its own laws.  Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 317.

     In Bartkus v. United States, 359 U.S. 121 (1959), however, 
the Supreme Court implicitly suggested an exception to the 
dual sovereignty doctrine.  Illinois had brought a robbery 
charge against a man who had been acquitted of the same 
charge in federal court.  The Court upheld the state prosecu-
tion, but emphasized that the evidence failed to show that 
Illinois, in bringing its suit, had been "merely a tool of the 
federal authorities" or that its prosecution had been "a sham 
and a cover for a federal prosecution."  Id. at 123-24.  A 
number of circuits have accordingly inferred a "sham prose-
cution" exception to dual sovereignty.  See, for example, 
United States v. Raymer, 941 F.2d 1031, 1037 (10th Cir. 
1991);  United States v. Bernhardt, 831 F.2d 181, 182 (9th Cir. 
1987).  United States v. Balsys, 524 U.S. 666 (1998), may 
indicate further support for such an exception.  There the 
Court held that while fear of prosecution in a foreign country 
normally does not provide a basis for asserting the Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination in a judicial pro-
ceeding in the United States, a different result might be 
appropriate if the foreign nation brought its prosecution "as 
much on behalf of the United States as of the prosecuting 
nation" itself.  Id. at 698-99.

     Several courts have stressed that the Bartkus exception is 
a narrow one and difficult to prove.  United States v. Guz-
man, 85 F.3d 823, 827 (1st Cir. 1996) (narrow exception);  
United States v. Aboumoussallem, 726 F.2d 906, 910 (2d Cir. 
1984) (same);  United States v. Figueroa-Soto, 938 F.2d 1015, 

1019 (9th Cir. 1991) (difficult to prove).  Others have ques-
tioned whether the exception even exists.  United States v. 
Brocksmith, 991 F.2d 1363, 1366 (7th Cir. 1993);  United 
States v. Patterson, 809 F.2d 244, 247 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1987).  
We have uncovered no case where a court found successive 
prosecutions by different nations to fall under the Bartkus 
exception, though defendants have tried the theory in at least 
four cases.  See Guzman, 85 F.3d at 827;  United States v. 
Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1994);  
United States v. McRary, 616 F.2d 181, 185 (5th Cir. 1980);  
United States v. Richardson, 580 F.2d 946, 947 (9th Cir. 
1978).  The government suggests that we should hold the 
exception inapplicable to foreign prosecutions.  It reasons 
foreign governments are never subject to the sort of federal 
domination that states may be, so that the sham relationship 
is much less probable in the international context.  Improba-
bility may imply rarity, but we do not think the sham 
relationship so unlikely as to justify a blanket rule against the 
exception in the foreign prosecution context.

     As a preliminary matter, we are not persuaded by Rashed's 
suggestion that the United States may have been in "privity" 
with Greece in that government's prosecution, and that this 
privity argues for finding the sham exception applicable.  
(Rashed makes no collateral estoppel claim per se, identifying 
no issue that was resolved in his favor in the Greek litigation.)  
In general, a party is in privity with another if it "assume[d] 
control over litigation" by the other.  Montana v. United 
States, 440 U.S. 147, 154 (1979).  See also 18 Charles Alan 
Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal 
Practice and Procedure s 4451, at 428 (1981).  Wright, Miller 
& Cooper suggest that control is enough if "the nonparty has 
the actual measure of control or opportunity to control that 
might reasonably be expected between two formal coparties."  
Id. at 430, citing Jones v. Craig, 212 F.2d 187 (6th Cir. 1954).  
Courts have occasionally hinted that privity as ordinarily 
conceived might justify application of collateral estoppel in 
the dual sovereignty context, but, finding privity require-
ments unmet, have not reached the issue.  See United States 
v. Davis, 906 F.2d 829, 834-35 (2d Cir. 1990);  United States 

v. Parcel Land at 5 Bell Rock Road, 896 F.2d 605, 610 (1st 
Cir. 1990) (Breyer, J.).  Because double jeopardy is a consti-
tutionalized instance of preclusion principles, Ashe v. Swen-
son, 397 U.S. 436, 445-46 (1970), a privity or control test 
represents an obvious candidate as the standard for an excep-
tion to the dual sovereignty doctrine.

     Yet in Bartkus the Court used the terms "sham" and 
"tool," which indicate--and have uniformly been understood 
by the lower federal courts to indicate--a far more special 
relationship than is suggested by the concept of privity or 
control, namely a relationship with a strong element of ma-
nipulation.  See United States v. Liddy, 542 F.2d 76, 79 (D.C. 
Cir. 1976) (reading Bartkus as support for the proposition 
that "federal authorities are proscribed from manipulating 
state processes to accomplish that which they cannot constitu-
tionally do themselves");  Guzman, 85 F.3d at 827 (emphasiz-
ing that the Bartkus exception is limited to situations in 
which one sovereign "thoroughly dominates or manipulates 
the prosecutorial machinery of another").  An easy case, for 
example, might be where a nation pursued a prosecution that 
did little or nothing to advance its independent interests, 
under threat of withdrawal of American aid on which its 
leadership was heavily dependent. But where the United 
States simply lends a foreign government investigatory re-
sources, the manipulation moniker is out of the question.  Id. 
at 828;  Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d at 1361.

     The Court's presumably deliberate non-use of the privity 
concept may also have reflected a recognition that under the 
dual sovereignty doctrine one sovereign's right to enforce its 
criminal law cannot be classified as the same "cause of action" 
as another's, and that the double jeopardy bar is more akin to 
claim preclusion than to issue preclusion.  Cf. Montana v. 
United States, 440 U.S. at 154 (stating that res judicata 
applies only to the same cause of action, and a cause of action 
vicariously asserted by a nonparty "differs by definition from 
that which he subsequently seeks to litigate in his own 
right");  but see Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 
797-802 (1996) (noting that res judicata may bar claims by 
privies, but finding application of res judicata a violation of 

due process on the specific facts before it).  In any event, the 
Bartkus Court's selection of one formula precludes our adop-
tion of another.  And here we needn't consider the issue-
preclusive effects of foreign judgments.

     The central issue in this case is whether Greece, in prose-
cuting Rashed, was a tool of the United States and the Greek 
trial a sham.  Two facts render Rashed's claim implausible.  
First, the United States wanted Greece to extradite Rashed, 
not to prosecute him.  Greece stood its ground and refused.  
Rashed acknowledges both the U.S. preference and the Greek 
resistance.  He points to what we may loosely call evidence 
that the United States threatened Greece with sanctions, but 
that evidence itself shows that the threats (if made at all) 
were always intended to secure extradition.  See, for exam-
ple, U.S. Blackmails Greece on Rashid [sic] Matter Through 
Aid, Eleftherotypia, May 27, 1989;  New Pressure by the U.S. 
for Rashid [sic], Eleftherotypia, Sept. 30, 1989;  Statement on 
the Rashid [sic] Case by Efstratios Korakas, Member of 
Greek Parliament representing the Communist Party of 
Greece and Member of European Parliament as of June 
1999.  The stalwart Greek resistance dispels any notion that 
Greece had "little or no independent volition" in its proceed-
ing.  Liddy, 542 F.2d at 79 (D.C. Cir. 1976);  United States v. 
38 Whalers Cove Drive, 954 F.2d 29, 38 (2d Cir. 1992).

     Rashed argues that the United States preferred a Greek 
prosecution to Rashed's release.  But that the United States 
got its second preference over its third is not evidence either 
of control or of a sham prosecution, especially where the 
United States's first option would have avoided the double 
jeopardy problem altogether.  Moreover, the only evidence 
Rashed has for the proposition that the United States sought 
a Greek prosecution on terrorism charges is unsubstantiated 
Greek newspaper stories claiming that "[r]umors have it that 
the Americans don't necessarily want Rashid [sic] right now, 
provided he stays in prison and is not let free."  U.S.:  Cut 
Off Relations with the Arabs!, Pondiki, Feb. 17, 1989.  See 
also The Blade--The Americans Find New "Evidence", Pon-
diki, Feb. 24, 1989.  Had Rashed read the two stories in their 
entirety he would have learned that the United States did not 

want Rashed imprisoned on the terrorism charges.  Rather, 
the scuttlebutt offered in the articles is that the United States 
wanted a prison guard to plant a knife on Rashed while he 
was awaiting extradition and have the Greek courts imprison 
him for the separate crime of possession of an illegal weapon.

     Second, Greece had an undeniable duty under the Montreal 
Convention to extradite Rashed.  Montreal Convention, art. 
8, 24 U.S.T. at 571.  Once it rebuffed the United States's 
extradition request, however, it was bound by the same treaty 
to prosecute.  Id., art. 7, 24 U.S.T. at 571.  Rashed's response 
is that the United States tricked Greece into arresting him;  
thus, but for the trick, Greece would never have faced the 
dilemma of having to extradite or prosecute.  But even after 
the arrest, Greece could have chosen extradition;  yet it 
refused to extradite, contrary to the United States' wishes 
and in the face of alleged congressional hints of foreign aid 
sanctions.

     Rashed offers other items as clues that Greece was a tool of 
the United States.  First, he points to extensive cooperation 
between the United States and Greece in his first trial. 
Indeed, U.S. assistance was so pervasive that Greece gath-
ered little of the presented evidence independently.  But 
Bartkus acknowledges that extensive law enforcement and 
prosecutorial cooperation between two sovereigns does not 
make a trial by either a sham.  Bartkus, 359 U.S. at 122-23.  
Indeed, courts have rejected the sham inference in the face of 
more far-reaching cooperation than that which occurred be-
tween Greece and the United States.  See, for example, 
United States v. Padilla, 589 F.2d 481, 484 (10th Cir. 1978) 
(rejecting a double jeopardy claim based on successive state-
federal prosecutions although state prosecutor was also the 
federal prosecutor and the only piece of evidence in the case 
was the testimony of a state police officer).  An inference of 
sham prosecution from cooperation would be especially weak 
where the Montreal Convention applies, for on these facts it 
required the United States to afford Greece the maximum 
possible assistance.  Montreal Convention, art. 11(1), 24 
U.S.T. at 572.  Finally, it would little advance the purposes of 
the Double Jeopardy Clause to require that the country more 

bent on prosecution refuse to cooperate with the other, 
forcing the latter to waste its resources in a redundant 
investigation.

     Rashed also argues that Greece had no independent inter-
est in prosecuting him. It is true that none of the offenses for 
which Rashed was prosecuted in Greece had any specific link 
to Greece, such as it being the site of the offense or the 
residence of the victims.  But international law recognizes 
stopping terrorism and piracy on (or above) the high seas as 
an interest of all nations, an interest strong enough to give 
the Greek courts jurisdiction.  Restatement (Third) of the 
Foreign Relations Law of the United States, ss 404, esp. 
comment a, and 423 (1987).  Further, Greece had an interest 
in abiding by its treaty obligations--here the requirement of 
the Montreal Convention, in the event of a refusal of extradi-
tion, to prosecute Rashed "without exception whatsoever and 
whether or not the offense was committed in its territory."  
Montreal Convention, art. 7, 24 U.S.T. at 571.

     The government suggests--and Rashed accepts--that one 
possible sign that the United States was using the Greek 
prosecution as its "tool" would be an indication that it was 
able, through the Greek prosecution, to achieve something it 
could not under the U.S. Constitution.  Cf. United States v. 
Liddy, 542 F.2d at 79.  Of course a procedural divergence 
alone would necessarily give only a weak sign;  states and 
nations naturally vary in details of criminal procedure, so a 
rule inferring manipulative intent merely from a few prosecu-
torial advantages in the state or nation that initially prose-
cutes would gut the dual sovereignty rule.  Similarly, the fact 
that dual prosecution is likely to increase the probability of 
conviction and the probable aggregate prison sentence is 
alone of no consequence, as dual prosecution always has those 
effects.  But a prosecutorial advantage, coupled with some 
evidence that the United States had helped bring it about, or 
that its existence had induced the United States to prefer and 
promote the foreign prosecution, might help support the 
"tool" inference.

     All Rashed has to offer on this account is a law, passed by 
Greece just before his trial, that had the effect of allowing 
him to be tried to a panel of three judges rather than a mixed 
jury of three judges and four lay jurors.  Greek Law 
1897/1990, art. 12, p 1 (Aug. 11, 1990).  Rashed does not claim 
that the United States pressured Greece into adopting the 
law, or that the United States saw Rashed's right to a jury 
trial as a hurdle to prosecution at home.  Further, the 
bedrock fact that the United States sought extradition over a 
Greek prosecution is completely inconsistent with an intent to 
bypass the U.S. Constitution.

     Ultimately we find that Rashed has failed to identify evi-
dence that would place his case within the Bartkus "sham 
prosecution" exception.  It is possible that, because terrorist 
acts committed anywhere are criminal in all countries, 
Rashed might find himself confronted with a Sisyphean chal-
lenge:  defeating the claims against him in one country only to 
have them brought against him in another.  As this is only 
his second prosecution, the hazard is speculative.  We leave 
the solution to another day.

     As a corollary to his double jeopardy claim, Rashed seeks 
discovery of information related to his "sham prosecution" 
allegation.  We see no reason to disturb the district court's 
denial of his request.  Because Rashed's defense here relates 
not to refutation of the government's case in chief but to 
establishment of an independent constitutional bar to the 
prosecution, Rule 16(a)(1)(C) of the Fed. R. Crim. P. is 
inapplicable.  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 462-
63 (1996).  Armstrong requires the defendant, as a condition 
of discovery, to adduce "some evidence tending to show the 
essential elements of" the defense, not just evidence "materi-
al" to that defense as required by Rule 16.  Id. at 462, 470.  
In Armstrong, which involved a claim of selective prosecution, 
the Court explained that this "rigorous standard" was suit-
able to prevent undue diversion of prosecutorial resources 
and disclosure of the government's prosecution strategy.  Id. 
at 468.  Discovery into Rashed's claim of "sham" prosecution 
presents the same issues of prosecutorial resources and strat-

egy, together with sensitive matters of foreign relations.  Cf. 
United States v. Yunis, 867 F.2d 617, 622-23 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

     In any case, Rashed has not met either the Armstrong or 
the Rule 16(a)(1)(C) test.  He doesn't claim that the United 
States preferred prosecution to extradition, or that further 
discovery would uncover evidence of such a preference.  He 
certainly cannot deny that the Montreal Convention required 
prosecution once Greece refused extradition to the United 
States.  The most that Rashed suggests would be uncovered 
in discovery is evidence that the United States, upon learning 
that Greece would refuse extradition, encouraged that gov-
ernment to prosecute rather than release Rashed.  But such 
evidence, as we have explained, would not sustain a conclusion 
that Greece was a tool of the United States.

     The district court's decision to deny Rashed's motion to 
dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy is

                                                               Affirmed.
