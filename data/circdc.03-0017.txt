      Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Edwards.

     Edwards, Circuit Judge:  Petitioners Consolidated Edison 
("ConEd") and other pipeline customers of Transcontinental 
Gas Pipeline Corporation ("Transco") ask this court to vacate 
three Orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission ("FERC" or the "Commission"), involving Transco's 
proposed rate change for several of its expansion projects.  
Petitioners contend that the policy standards used by FERC 
to evaluate Transco's proposal violate the Administrative 
Procedure Act ("APA").

     Reversing a decision by an administrative law judge 
("ALJ"), FERC approved Transco's proposal to shift from 
"incremental" pricing to "rolled-in" rates based on standards 
enunciated in a 1995 Policy Statement.  Transcon. Gas Pipe 
Line Corp., 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,087 (Apr. 16, 1999) ("Transco 
I"), reprinted in Joint Appendix ("J.A.") 181-98.  After peti-
tioners filed requests for rehearing on this matter, FERC 
issued a new 1999 Policy Statement for future rate change 
proposals.  However, in addressing the petition for rehearing, 
the Commission again evaluated Transco's proposal pursuant 
to the 1995 Policy Statement and ultimately upheld its initial 
ruling to approve the rate change.  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line 
Corp., 94 F.E.R.C. p 61,362 (Mar. 28, 2001) ("Transco II"), 
reprinted in J.A. 199-215.  Subsequently, in response to a 
second petition for rehearing, FERC rejected objections to its 
reliance on the 1995 Policy Statement.  Order Denying Re-
hearing, Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 95 F.E.R.C. p 61,388 
(June 13, 2001) ("Transco III"), reprinted in J.A. 232-36.

     Petitioners argue that the disputed Orders are unreason-
able, because they rely upon the 1995 Policy Statement rather 
than the 1999 Policy Statement.  Petitioners contend that 
FERC was obliged to apply the more recent policy statement, 
because it was issued while the Transco case was still pend-
ing.  We disagree.

     The application of a newly adopted policy statement to a 
pending case is not presumed unless the policy change has 
the "force of law."  When an agency issues a policy statement 
that is not binding and merely signals how the agency may 
handle future cases, there is no legal principle that mandates 
retroactive application of the new policy statement to pending 
cases.  Retroactive application to pending cases may be per-
missible, but it is not required.  An agency may decide to 
apply a pre-existing policy to resolve a pending case, so long 
as that policy is not otherwise arbitrary and the agency 
provides a reasoned explanation for its decision.

     On the record before us, we hold that FERC did not act 
unlawfully in applying its 1995 Policy Statement when it 
resolved Transco's proposal to implement rolled-in rates.  We 
further hold that the 1995 Policy Statement is not unreason-
able, either facially or as applied in this case.  Finally, we 
hold that FERC sufficiently explained its reasons for relying 
on the 1995 Policy Statement (rather than the 1999 Policy 
Statement) to evaluate the rate change proposal.  We reject 
petitioners' arguments to the contrary.  Accordingly, we deny 
the petition for review.

                          I. Background

A.   Regulatory Framework

     Under the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"), FERC has jurisdic-
tion to approve the construction of natural gas pipeline facili-
ties and to regulate the transportation of natural gas in 
interstate commerce.  15 U.S.C. s 717, et seq. (2000).  Any 
pipeline seeking to build or to expand its facilities must first 
apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity 
from FERC.  After notice and hearing, FERC may authorize 

or "certificate" any pipeline project that the agency deter-
mines is "necessary or desirable in the public interest."  Id. 
s 717f.

     The NGA requires that all rates and charges by pipelines 
must be "just and reasonable."  Id. s 717c(a).  Rate cases 
before FERC are reviewed under either section 4 or section 5 
of the NGA:

          [T]his court has strictly policed the statutory line 
     that separates action taken under NGA section 4 
     from that taken under NGA section 5.  In Algon-
     quin, we described this distinction as follows:
     
          [T]he Commission may act under two different 
     sections of the Natural Gas Act (NGA or the 
     Act) to effect a change in a gas company's rates. 
     When the Commission reviews rate increases 
     that a gas company has proposed, it is subject 
     to the requirements of section 4(e) of the Act.  
     Under section 4(e), the gas company bears the 
     burden of proving that its proposed rates are 
     reasonable.  On the other hand, when the Com-
     mission seeks to impose its own rate determina-
     tions, rather than accepting or rejecting a 
     change proposed by the gas company, it must 
     do so in compliance with section 5(a) of the 
     NGA.
     
          Under section 5, the Commission must first establish 
     that the proposed or existing rate is unjust and 
     unreasonable.  It is only after this antecedent show-
     ing has been made that the Commission properly 
     can illustrate that its alternative rate proposal is 
     both just and reasonable.
     
"Complex" Consol. Edison Co. v. FERC, 165 F.3d 992, 1001 
(D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. v. 
FERC, 948 F.2d 1305, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 1991)) (citations omit-
ted).

     Generally, a pipeline can allocate the costs associated with 
new or expanded facilities in one of two ways.  The pipeline 

may "roll in" these costs, by distributing additional charges 
among all customers of the pipeline system.  This pricing 
approach recognizes that the pipeline is "not just a collection 
of discrete pieces and parts, but an integrated system serving 
all of its customers."  Battle Creek Gas Co. v. Fed. Power 
Comm'n, 281 F.2d 42, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1960).  The alternative to 
rolled-in rates is "incremental" pricing:

          Whatever its virtues, use of a "rolled-in" approach 
     alone is not adequate in all situations, particularly 
     where some assets are used by the utility solely for 
     the benefit of one customer.  At some point in every 
     gas distribution facility the general system ends and 
     connective links to the local distributors' own equip-
     ment begins.  At this point the facility becomes so 
     identified with its function as a part of the local 
     distributor's gas plant that it may be unfair to 
     charge its costs to all of the customers of the utility.  
     This is particularly so where the extent and cost of 
     such segregated facilities vary greatly among the 
     customers.  In such a situation the costs of these 
     facilities are commonly charged as an "incremental" 
     cost added in to the particular customer's rate base.  
     Whether the cost of a particular facility is more 
     properly treated as a systemic cost and rolled-in to 
     the rate base of all of the customers, or as a 
     segregated cost to a particular customer, which 
     should be treated on an incremental basis, is fre-
     quently a difficult issue of fact presented to the 
     Commission.
     
Id. at 46-47 (footnote omitted).

     Over time, FERC policy has moved away from routinely 
encouraging rolled-in rates toward a preference for rate 
proposals that rely upon incremental pricing.  See Trans- 
Canada Pipelines Ltd. v. FERC, 24 F.3d 305, 308 (D.C. Cir. 
1994).  Responding to this court's directives to justify its 
evolving standard for evaluating rate allocation proposals, 
FERC adopted a Policy Statement discussing its revised 
approach.  Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities 

Constructed By Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 
F.E.R.C. p 61,241 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 F.E.R.C. p 61,105 
(1996) ("1995 Statement").  The Commission's goals were to 
give the industry clear signals about which pricing approach 
would govern an expansion project and to avoid imposing 
"rate shock" on existing pipeline customers.  1995 Statement, 
71 F.E.R.C. at 61,915.

     FERC described two essential features of the 1995 Policy 
Statement:

          First, the Commission will make a determination of 
     an appropriate rate design in a pipeline's certificate 
     proceeding.  Second, when the pipeline seeks rolled-
     in pricing, the Commission will base its pricing 
     decision on an evaluation of the system-wide benefits 
     of the project and the rate impact on existing cus-
     tomers.  To reduce uncertainty, in those cases, the 
     Commission will establish a presumption for rolled-
     in rates when the rate effect on existing customers is 
     not substantial.
     
Id.  The Commission indicated that a rolled-in rate proposal 
was presumptively valid if the rate impact on existing custom-
ers was 5% or less and the pipeline company also offered 
evidence of general systemwide benefits.  Id. at 61,916-17.

     After 1995, as competition in the pipeline industry in-
creased, FERC decided to develop a new policy that de-
emphasized rolled-in rates.  Certification of New Interstate 
Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, 88 F.E.R.C. p 61,227 (1999), 
clarified, 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,128, further clarified, 94 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,094 (2000) ("1999 Statement").  In issuing the new policy, 
FERC sought to "strike the proper balance between the 
enhancement of competitive alternatives and the possibility of 
over building."  1999 Statement, 88 F.E.R.C. at 61,737.  The 
1999 Statement indicated that FERC would not approve 
rolled-in rates unless the pipeline could show that the benefits 
of construction outweighed the adverse economic effects on 
existing pipeline customers:

          If residual adverse effects on [existing pipeline cus-
     tomers, other pipelines in the market and their 
     captive customers, or the economic interest of adja-
     cent landowners and communities] are identified, 
     after efforts have been made to minimize them, then 
     the Commission will proceed to evaluate the project 
     by balancing the evidence of public benefits to be 
     achieved against the residual adverse effects.  This 
     is essentially an economic test.
     
Id. at 61,745.  FERC emphasized that its "economic test" for 
rate proposals would apply prospectively:  "[T]he new policy 
will not be applied retroactively to cases where the certificate 
has already issued and the investment decisions have been 
made."  Id. at 61,750.

B.   Procedural Background

     Transco operates a natural gas pipeline that connects pro-
duction sites along the Gulf of Mexico with customers located 
along the Eastern seaboard.  The company's pipeline system 
serves most of the East Coast metropolitan markets including 
Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and New York City.  Between 
1984 and 1994, FERC certificated 12 of Transco's expansion 
projects - nine that linked the company's pipeline to areas in 
Pennsylvania and three others that added capacity to the 
section of the pipeline between Virginia and Alabama.  See 
Transco II, 94 F.E.R.C. at 62,307, J.A. 200;  Transco I, 87 
F.E.R.C. at 61,383-84, J.A. 181-82.  FERC initially certificat-
ed all of these projects under an incremental pricing scheme, 
before it issued the 1995 Statement.  Transco I, 87 F.E.R.C. 
at 61,385, J.A. 183.

     In March 1995, Transco applied to FERC for a general 
rate increase pursuant to section 4 of the NGA.  Id. at 61,383, 
J.A. 181.  This rate filing included a variety of planned 
changes, but Transco did not seek to switch from incremental 
pricing.  Id.  Several pipeline customers who paid incremen-
tal costs intervened and objected to this proposal, arguing 
that Transco should instead adopt rolled-in rates.  After a 
series of negotiations led to a settlement of several issues in 

dispute, FERC approved a deal reflecting the parties' partial 
agreement and scheduled the remaining matters for a hearing 
before an ALJ.  Id. at 61,384, J.A. 182.  As part of this 
arrangement, Transco reserved the right to seek rolled-in 
rates for its expansion projects at a later time.

     In November 1996, while the administrative hearing on the 
remaining issues was in progress, Transco and other interest-
ed parties submitted a new rate change proposal to FERC.  
Id.  Under this proposal, the company planned to roll in costs 
for the expansion projects on a prospective basis.  The Com-
mission consolidated the hearing on Transco's rolled-in rate 
proposal with the ongoing agency proceedings.  Following an 
evidentiary hearing on this issue, the ALJ ruled that Transco 
was not entitled to charge rolled-in rates to cover expansion 
costs.  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 82 F.E.R.C. p 63,019 
(1998), reprinted in J.A. 134-80.  The ALJ determined that 
the proposal was governed by section 5 of the NGA.  Id. at 
65,163-66, J.A. 140-43.  Applying the standards from the 1995 
Statement, the ALJ found that existing customers faced an 
increase that exceeded the 5% presumption for rolled-in 
rates.  Id. at 65,175-76, J.A. 152-53.  Therefore, the ALJ 
concluded, Transco could not justify rolled-in rates simply by 
referring to evidence of general systemwide benefits.  Id. at 
65,179, J.A. 156.

     On April 16, 1999, the Commission reversed the ALJ's 
ruling and approved the rolled-in rates proposed by Transco.  
See Transco I, 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,087, J.A. 181.  The Commis-
sion found that the ALJ erred in applying section 5, instead 
of section 4, of the NGA.  The Commission also determined 
that the ALJ had misapplied the 1995 Statement in assessing 
Transco's proposal.  Rather than evaluating the combined 
rate impact of all 12 expansion projects in light of the 5% 
presumption, FERC held that the correct methodology was to 
apply the 5% presumption to interrelated groups of projects.  
Id. at 61,389, J.A. 187.  Dividing the projects into seven 
groups, FERC found that the rate change for each group 
would not exceed the 5% threshold and that Transco had 
shown benefits that satisfied its burden of proof.  Id. at 
61,394-95, J.A. 192-93.

     Petitioners filed a request for rehearing.  FERC then 
issued the new 1999 Policy Statement, i.e., after petitioners' 
request for rehearing had been filed.  On March 28, 2001, the 
Commission denied petitioners' requests for a rehearing on 
its initial Order.  Transco II, 94 F.E.R.C. p 61,362, J.A. 199.  
The Commission declined to apply the new 1999 Policy State-
ment, because the Transco case had been fully litigated under 
the 1995 Policy Statement.  Id. at 62,310, J.A. 203.  The 
Commission then upheld its initial finding that Transco's 
rolled-in rate was warranted under the statute based on the 
factors in the 1995 Statement:

          The Commission is unpersuaded by ConEdison, et 
     al.'s arguments that Transco failed to meet its Sec-
     tion 4 burden with regards to its roll-in proposal.  
     Transco has sufficiently shown that rolled-in rates 
     are just and reasonable as evidenced by the Com-
     mission's findings that:  (1) the expansion facilities 
     are fully integrated with Transco's system;  (2) the 
     expansion facilities provide significant system bene-
     fits;  and (3) the rate impact of rolling in the costs of 
     the expansion facilities is less than 5 percent.
     
Id. at 62,316, J.A. 209.

     On the same day that FERC issued its decision in Transco 
II, the Commission decided another, unrelated case in which 
it applied the 1999 Policy Statement.  See Transcon. Gas 
Pipe Line Corp., 94 F.E.R.C. p 61,360 (2001). Petitioners 
again sought rehearing, contending that the 1999 Policy 
Statement should have been applied to Transco in this pro-
ceeding as well.  On June 13, 2001, FERC denied petitioners' 
requests for further rehearing.  Transco III, 95 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,388, J.A. 232.  The Commission specifically addressed 
arguments that the 1999 Statement should have governed, as 
in the other case decided on the same day as Transco II.  Id. 
at 62,450-51, J.A. 235-36.  First, FERC noted that the pro-
jects in the two cases were of a different vintage.  The 
Commission also reiterated that, in Transco's case, the parties 
had completed the evidentiary hearing under the 1995 State-
ment.  The same was not true in the other case.  Finally, the 

Commission noted that its handling of Transco's rate change 
proposal was not inconsistent with the policy goals articulated 
in the 1999 Statement.  Id.

     This petition for review followed.

                           II. Analysis

     FERC's orders must be upheld unless they are "arbitrary, 
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-
dance with law."  5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A);  see Union Pac. 
Fuels, Inc. v. FERC, 129 F.3d 157, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  The 
court's role is "limited to assuring that the Commission's 
decisionmaking is reasoned, principled, and based upon the 
record."  Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate v. 
FERC, 131 F.3d 182, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  In reviewing 
FERC's orders, we must be certain that the Commission has 
considered the relevant data and "articulate[d] ... a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made."  
Ass'n of Oil Pipe Lines v. FERC, 83 F.3d 1424, 1431 (D.C. 
Cir. 1996) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm 
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).

     Petitioners maintain that FERC acted unreasonably by 
ignoring the relevant standards and factors articulated in the 
1999 Policy Statement.  They argue that, once FERC issued 
the 1999 Statement, the continued application of the 1995 
Statement in Transco's rate case was impermissible.  They 
further contend that the Commission's use of the earlier 
policy was unreasonable, because neither the pipeline nor its 
customers had a reliance interest in the previous policy. In 
petitioners' view, FERC had an obligation to apply the 1999 
Statement retroactively to all currently pending cases - even 
including those in which the record had been fully developed 
under a lawful pre-existing policy statement.  Petitioners' 
view is misguided.

     Normally, an agency must adhere to its precedents in 
adjudicating cases before it.  See Hatch v. FERC, 654 F.2d 
825, 835 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  An agency may, within the realm 
of its statutory authority, change the established law and 
apply newly created rules.  Id. at 837 (citing NLRB v. Bell 

Aerospace, 416 U.S. 267 (1974)).  Such changes may occur in 
the course of an adjudication, so long as the agency acts 
pursuant to delegated authority, adopts a permissible con-
struction of the statute, and adopts a rule that is not arbitrary 
and capricious.  NAACP v. FCC, 682 F.2d 993, 998 (D.C. Cir. 
1982).  A new rule may be applied retroactively to the parties 
in an ongoing adjudication, so long as the parties before the 
agency are given notice and an opportunity to offer evidence 
bearing on the new standard, Hatch, 654 F.2d at 835, and the 
affected parties have not detrimentally relied on the estab-
lished legal regime, Clark-Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency v. 
FERC, 826 F.2d 1074, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc);  Retail, 
Wholesale & Dep't Store Union v. NLRB, 466 F.2d 380, 390 
(D.C. Cir. 1972).

     "Policy statements" differ from substantive rules that carry 
the "force of law," because they lack "present binding effect" 
on the agency.  Interstate Natural Gas Ass'n v. FERC, 285 
F.3d 18, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  When an agency hears a case 
under an established policy statement, it may decide the case 
using that policy statement if the decision is not otherwise 
arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Woodland Broad. v. FCC, 
414 F.2d 1160, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  If, however, the agency 
changes its policy statement before the case is complete, it 
must explain why the pending case should be decided on the 
basis of the old versus the new policy. Williston Basin 
Interstate Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 165 F.3d 54, 62 (D.C. Cir. 
1999).

     Thus, the principles governing retroactivity differ depend-
ing upon whether the agency has acted to change the sub-
stantive law or merely issue a new, non-binding policy state-
ment.  If an agency adopts a new rule that reflects a change 
in "law," we presume that the new rule will be given retroac-
tive application.  The agency thus may decide a pending case 
by applying the new substantive rule, subject to notice re-
quirements and detrimental reliance considerations.  Clark-
Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency, 826 F.2d at 1081.  If, how-
ever, an agency merely adopts a new "policy statement" that 
does not purport to have the "force of law," it is "binding on 
no party and ha[s] no precedential effect." Panhandle East-

ern Pipe Line Co. v. FERC, 198 F.3d 266, 269 (D.C. Cir. 
1999).  The agency need only give a reasoned explanation for 
its failure to apply a new policy statement in a pending case 
tried under an old policy statement.  Williston Basin, 165 
F.3d at 62.

     Contrary to petitioners' suggestion, Williston Basin does 
not stand for the proposition that an agency must apply a 
newly adopted policy statement to all pending cases.  In 
Williston Basin, FERC "shifted course" with regard to one 
of the policies in dispute while the case was on appeal in this 
court.  The court therefore held that the case should be 
remanded to the agency to allow FERC to reconsider its 
application of the pre-existing policy in light of the change.  
Id.  The court did not indicate which policy should be applied 
by the agency on remand, because it was understood that 
neither policy statement carried the "force of law."  In other 
words, the court did not presume that a new policy statement 
must be applied retroactively to the parties in a pending case, 
for the obvious reason that a policy statement only signals the 
agency's possible behavior in future cases.

     Petitioners cite Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 76 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,022 (1996), aff'd, "Complex" Consol. Edison Co. v. FERC, 
165 F.3d 992 (D.C. Cir. 1999), and Pacific Gas Transmission 
Co., 50 F.E.R.C. p 61,067 (1990), in support of their view that 
new policy statements must be applied to pending cases.  The 
decisions in these cases do not say this.  Rather, in these 
cases, the agency opted to apply "new" policies to ongoing 
adjudications.  But this is neither surprising nor impermissi-
ble.  FERC merely exercised its discretion to apply new 
policies to ongoing adjudications.  The agency did not say 
that it was bound to follow the policy statements in all future 
cases, nor did the reviewing court.

     In this case, FERC's new policy statement did not purport 
to carry the "force of law."  The 1999 Statement was non-
binding and it was issued with a statement that FERC 
intended to change its enforcement regime in future rate 
cases.  Furthermore, there is nothing in the record of this 
case indicating that application of the 1995 Statement was 

unreasonable or otherwise unlawful.  Nonetheless, FERC 
had a duty to explain why it chose to apply the old, and not 
the new, pricing policy in Transco II and Transco III.  
Indeed, the need for an explanation is quite apparent here, 
because the Commission elected to apply the new policy in 
another rate case on the same day that it decided to apply the 
1995 Policy Statement, and declined to apply the 1999 Policy 
Statement, in Transco II.  See Williston Basin, 165 F.3d at 
62.  Petitioners claim that the agency's decision on this score 
cannot survive review.  We disagree.

     Petitioners argue that FERC's "vintage" distinction fails to 
justify its use of the 1995 Policy Statement in the present 
case.  While the "vintage" concept appears to denote the 
length of time that the pipeline facilities have been incremen-
tally priced, see Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 94 F.E.R.C. 
at 62,303, Respondent's Br. at 19 n.8, the Commission did not 
provide a clear definition of this term and did not adequately 
explain why a different "vintage" matters in its decision about 
which policy statement should apply.  We therefore agree 
with petitioners that this justification alone cannot sustain the 
agency's decision.

     The Commission provided a second explanation for han-
dling the two cases differently, however - administrative 
convenience.  Unlike the instant case, in which all of the 
underlying litigation was completed before the announcement 
of the new 1999 Policy Statement, the original filing in the 
second rate case did not occur until 2000.  Transcon. Gas 
Pipe Line Corp., 94 F.E.R.C. at 62,299.  When FERC reject-
ed petitioners' first request for rehearing in Transco II, the 
Commission explained that it would apply the 1995 Statement 
because the factual record had been fully developed:

          The hearing in this case was conducted while the 
     1995 Pricing Policy Statement was in effect, and all 
     the parties have presented evidence and filed plead-
     ings based on the application of that policy.  By 
     contrast, the new policy having not been established 
     until after the instant rehearing requests were filed, 
     there is no record in this case upon which the 
     
     Commission could make a determination as to how 
     the new policy should apply, and the parties have 
     had no opportunity to present positions on that 
     issue.
     
Transco II, 94 F.E.R.C. at 62,310, J.A. 203.  The Commission 
referred to this same rationale in denying petitioners' second 
request for rehearing:

          Because the hearing took place while the 1995 Pric-
     ing Policy Statement was in effect, and the parties' 
     evidence and arguments were presented with refer-
     ence to that policy, the Commission reasonably ap-
     plied the 1995 Pricing Policy to the issues in this 
     case.
     
Transco III, 95 F.E.R.C. at 62,451, J.A. 236.  In both of these 
statements, FERC suggested that applying the 1999 State-
ment would lead to significant delays and inconveniences.  
The parties had already developed an entire evidentiary 
record highlighting the factors relevant to the 1995 Policy 
Statement.  The 1995 Statement was not unreasonable or 
unlawful, either facially or as applied in this case, so the 
Commission was not foreclosed from relying on it in assessing 
the merits of Transco's proposal.  And reopening the record 
would have wasted significant time and money, which would 
have undermined the agency's interest in efficiency and the 
parties' interest in a prompt resolution of the matter.  We 
therefore find that FERC's justification for applying the 1995 
Policy Statement in the Transco case is reasonable and 
consistent with the overall goals of the Natural Gas Act.

                         III. Conclusion

     For the reasons discussed above, we hereby deny the 
petitions for review.
