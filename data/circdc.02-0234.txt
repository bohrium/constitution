     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Mountain States Legal Foundation 
and the Blue Ribbon Coalition (hereafter "Mountain States") 
appeal the dismissal of their complaint challenging six Presi-
dential Proclamations as unconstitutional and ultra vires ac-
tions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to 
state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  
Mountain States contends that the district court erred by 
limiting its review to the face of the Proclamations rather 
than conducting factfinding to determine whether the Presi-
dent had complied with the limitations, structure, and pur-
poses of the Antiquities Act ("the Act"), 16 U.S.C. s 431 
(2000).  Absent such judicial review, it contends, the Act 
constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of congressional 
authority.  Mountain States maintains that its complaint stat-
ed a claim because the Proclamations reach far beyond the 
purpose, scope, and size of any national monuments contem-
plated by Congress under the Act and are contrary to various 
statutes relating to the protection of environmental values on 
federal land.  We have no occasion to decide the availability 
or scope of judicial review of a Presidential Proclamation 
designating federal lands as a national monument under the 
Antiquities Act, for Mountain States has failed to present any 
factual allegation sufficient to warrant review of its ultra 
vires claim.  Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the 
complaint.

                                I.

     Near the end of his second term in office, President Clinton 
exercised his authority under the Antiquities Act to issue a 

series of Presidential Proclamations designating a handful of 
national monuments in the western United States.  Among 
these designations are the six Proclamations that Mountain 
States challenged in its complaint:  (1) the Grand Canyon-
Parashant National Monument, a "geological treasure" that 
encompasses an important watershed for the Colorado River 
and the Grand Canyon in northwest Arizona, Proclamation 
No. 7265, 65 Fed. Reg. 2825, 2825-26 (Jan. 18, 2000);  (2) the 
Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in southwest 
Colorado, a "rugged landscape" containing "the highest 
known density of archaeological sites in the Nation," Procla-
mation No. 7317, 65 Fed. Reg. 37,243 (June 13, 2000);  (3) the 
Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, a "biological cross-
roads" in southwestern Oregon where the Cascade Range 
intersects with adjacent ecoregions, Proclamation No. 7318, 
65 Fed. Reg. 37,249 (June 13, 2000);  (4) the Hanford Reach 
National Monument, a habitat in southern Washington that is 
the largest remnant of the shrub-steppe ecosystem that once 
dominated the Columbia River basin, Proclamation No. 7319, 
65 Fed. Reg. 37,253 (June 13, 2000);  (5) the Ironwood Forest 
National Monument, an arid terrain in southern Arizona 
marked by rock art sites and other archaeological objects of 
scientific interest, Proclamation No. 7320, 65 Fed. Reg. 37,259 
(June 13, 2000);  and (6) the Sonoran Desert National Monu-
ment, a desert ecosystem containing an array of biological, 
scientific, and historic resources, Proclamation No. 7397, 66 
Fed. Reg. 7354 (Jan. 22, 2001).

     Mountain States alleged in its complaint that the President 
acted unconstitutionally and ultra vires under the Property 
Clause, U.S. Const., art. IV, s 2, cl. 2, in issuing these 
Proclamations.  In the district court Mountain States argued 
that the President lacked the authority to designate the 
monuments because the Property Clause confers on Congress 
all powers relating to federal land.  The focus of its argument 
shifted, however, when the government invoked the Antiqui-
ties Act in its motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 
12(b)(2) and (b)(6).  The government argued that because the 
President had issued the Proclamations under the Antiquities 
Act, judicial review was limited to whether the President 

exercised his discretion in accordance with the standards in 
the Act, and that review of the face of the Proclamations 
sufficed to dispose of Mountain States' arguments.  Mountain 
States responded that factfinding was required to ensure that 
the President had acted within the scope of his statutory 
authority, and in particular that the court should review, in 
light of the statutory standards, the basis on which the 
President acted.  According to Mountain States, Congress 
intended only to preserve ruins, artifacts, and other man-
made objects situated on public lands--not the land itself--by 
the smallest possible reservation of public land necessary for 
protection of the monument.

     The district court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the 
Property Clause was not at issue and that under the Antiqui-
ties Act only facial review of Mountain States' arguments was 
appropriate.  Upon facial review, the court concluded that the 
President had referenced the relevant statutory standards 
and had not acted ultra vires.

                               II.

     On appeal, Mountain States contends that, in light of the 
presumption of judicial reviewability of executive action, sub-
stantive review was required to ensure that substantial evi-
dence existed to support the President's issuance of the 
Proclamations.  Arguing that the Proclamations' nature, size, 
and scope facially contravene Congress's limited purpose, 
which was to preserve rare and discrete man-made objects, 
such as prehistoric ruins and ancient artifacts, Mountain 
States further contends that the Presidential actions violate 
other statutes governing the withdrawal of land from public 
use and the protection of environmental values on federal 
land.  Hence, Mountain States maintains, the district court 
erred in dismissing its complaint based only on facial review 
of the Proclamations.

     Our review of the grant of a motion to dismiss is de novo.  
Wilson v. Pena, 79 F.3d 154, 160 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In 
ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint the district court 
must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, 

Maljack Prods., Inc. v. Motion Picture Ass'n of Am., Inc., 52 
F.3d 373, 374 (D.C. Cir. 1995), and must not dismiss the 
complaint unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff 
can prove no set of facts in support of its claim that would 
entitle it to relief.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 
(1957).  Despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8's simpli-
fied notice pleading standard, "the court need not accept 
inferences drawn by plaintiffs if such inferences are unsup-
ported by the facts set out in the complaint.  Nor must the 
court accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual 
allegations."  Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d 
1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  With this standard in mind, we 
turn to Mountain States' contentions.

                                A.

     The Antiquities Act provides, in relevant part:

     The President of the United States is authorized, in his 
     discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic 
     landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other 
     objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated 
     upon lands owned or controlled by the Government of the 
     United States to be national monuments, and may re-
     serve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which 
     in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compat-
     ible with the proper care and management of the objects 
     to be protected....
     
16 U.S.C. s 431.  Presidential Proclamations designating na-
tional monuments have been challenged in only a handful of 
cases;  in each the court has upheld the President's action.1

(BNA) 1853, 1855 (D. Alaska July 1, 1980) (President Carter's 
creation of monuments in Alaska);  Wyoming v. Franke, 58 F. Supp. 
890, 896 (D. Wyo. 1945) (President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 
designation of the Jackson Hole National Monument);  cf. Alaska v. 
Carter, 462 F. Supp. 1155, 1159-60 (D. Alaska 1978) (holding that 
President is not subject to environmental impact statement require-
ments when proclaiming monuments under the Antiquities Act).  
See also Tulare County v. Bush, slip op. at 1, ___ F.3d at ____ 
(D.C. Cir. Oct. 18, 2002), also decided today.

The Supreme Court has considered the Antiquities Act in 
three cases, each time confirming the broad power delegated 
to the President under the Act.  United States v. California, 
436 U.S. 32 (1978);  Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128, 
141-42 (1976);  Cameron v. United States, 252 U.S. 450 
(1920).

     Although the Supreme Court has never expressly discussed 
the scope of judicial review under the Antiquities Act, the 
Court has directly addressed the nature of review of discre-
tionary Presidential decisionmaking under other statutes.  
The Court has highlighted the separation of powers concerns 
that inhere in such circumstances and has cautioned that 
these concerns bar review for abuse of discretion altogether.  
United States v. George S. Bush & Co., for example, involved 
s 336(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, which provided that the 
President:

     shall by proclamation approve rates of duties and 
     changes in classification and in basis of value specified in 
     any report of the [Tariff] [C]ommission ... if in his 
     judgment such rates of duty and changes are shown by 
     such investigation of the commission to be necessary to 
     equalize such differences in costs of production.
     
310 U.S. 371, 376-77 (1940) (quoting 19 U.S.C. s 1336(a)) 
(emphasis added).  The statute provided for judicial review 
only of legal questions.  The Court held that "[t]he Presi-
dent's method of solving the problem [of foreign exchange 
value] was open to scrutiny neither by the Court of Customs 
and Patent Appeals nor by us."  Id. at 379.  Similarly, in 
Dalton v. Specter, the Court considered a statute--the De-
fense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990--that did 
"not at all limit the President's discretion...."  511 U.S. 462, 
476 (1994).  Judicial review was unavailable under the Admin-
istrative Procedures Act ("APA") because the President is not 
an "agency" within the meaning of that statute.  Id. at 469-70 
(citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-01 
(1992)).  The Court then "assume[d] for the sake of argument 
that some claims that the President has violated a statutory 
mandate are judicially reviewable outside the framework of 

the APA," id. at 474 (citation omitted), but it reiterated that 
"such review is not available when the statute commits the 
decision to the discretion of the President."  Id.  The Court 
held, "[h]ow the President chooses to exercise the discretion 
Congress has granted him is not a matter for our review."  
Id. at 476.

     A somewhat different case is presented, however, where 
the authorizing statute or another statute places discernible 
limits on the President's discretion.  Judicial review in such 
instances does not implicate separation of powers concerns to 
the same degree as where the statute did "not at all limit" the 
discretion of the President.  Id. at 476;  cf. California, 436 
U.S. at 33.  As this court observed in Chamber of Commerce 
v. Reich, "Dalton's holding merely stands for the proposition 
that when a statute entrusts a discrete specific decision to the 
President and contains no limitations on the President's exer-
cise of that authority, judicial review of an abuse of discretion 
claim is not available."  74 F.3d 1322, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1996) 
(footnote omitted).  "Dalton is inapposite," the court ex-
plained, "where the claim instead is that the presidential 
action ... independently violates" another statute.  Id. at 
1332.  The court rejected the government's position "that the 
Procurement Act grants the President such broad discretion 
... that the case reduces only to a claim that the President 
abused his discretion--a claim that [the court is] not autho-
rized to entertain."  Id. at 1326.  It would be "untenable," the 
court stated, "to conclude that there are no judicially enforce-
able limitations on presidential actions, besides actions that 
run afoul of the Constitution or which contravene direct 
statutory prohibitions, so long as the President claims that he 
is acting pursuant to" a statutory directive.  Id. at 1332.  
Rather, the court emphasized that " '[t]he responsibility of 
determining the limits of statutory grants of authority ... is 
a judicial function entrusted to the courts by Congress....' "  
Id. at 1327 (quoting Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 310 
(1944)).  The court then held that the President had exceeded 
his authority under the Procurement Act in issuing an Execu-
tive Order barring federal contractors from hiring replace-
ment workers during an economic strike because the Order 

was preempted by an independent statute, the National La-
bor Relations Act.  Id. at 1339.

     Although the limits on Presidential authority at issue de-
rive from the Antiquities Act itself rather than an indepen-
dent statute, Reich is instructive, for the same policy consid-
erations apply.  Courts remain obligated to determine 
whether statutory restrictions have been violated.  In re-
viewing challenges under the Antiquities Act, the Supreme 
Court has indicated generally that review is available to 
ensure that the Proclamations are consistent with constitu-
tional principles and that the President has not exceeded his 
statutory authority.  United States v. California, 436 U.S. at 
35-36;  Cappaert, 426 U.S. at 141-42;  Cameron, 252 U.S. at 
455-56.

     The instant case, however, presents no occasion for the 
court to engage in ultra vires review of the Proclamations 
because Mountain States fails to allege any facts sufficient to 
support its ultra vires claim.  Mountain States alleges in its 
complaint merely that the six Proclamations at issue exceed 
the President's authority under the Property Clause and are 
therefore "unconstitutional and ultra vires."  Compl. p p 84-
104.  No constitutional Property Clause claim is before us, as 
the President exercised his delegated powers under the An-
tiquities Act, and that statute includes intelligible principles 
to guide the President's actions.  See Whitman v. Am. Truck-
ing Ass'ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 474 (2000);  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 
473-74 & n.6.  In responding to the government's reliance on 
the Antiquities Act, Mountain States argued in the district 
court that the President had included ineligible items within 
the designation--namely land--whereas the legislative history 
of the Act indicated, Mountain States asserted, that Congress 
intended only that rare and discrete man-made objects, such 
as prehistoric ruins and ancient artifacts, were to be designat-
ed.  That argument fails as a matter of law in light of 
Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Act to authorize 
the President to designate the Grand Canyon and similar 
sites as national monuments.  See, e.g., Cameron, 252 U.S. 
450.  And to the extent that Mountain States seeks ultra 
vires review under the Act, its complaint and statutory argu-

ments present no more than legal conclusions.  At no point 
has Mountain States presented factual allegations that would 
occasion further review of the President's actions.  Rather, 
Mountain States' arguments contain only the bald assertion 
that the President acted outside the bounds of his constitu-
tional and statutory authority.  Although in reviewing the 
dismissal of a complaint the court, as it must, takes "all the 
factual allegations in the complaint as true," the court is "not 
bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual 
allegation."  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986) 
(citation omitted).  Moreover, the court is necessarily sensi-
tive to pleading requirements where, as here, it is asked to 
review the President's actions under a statute that confers 
very broad discretion on the President and separation of 
powers concerns are presented.  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474-76;  
Bush, 310 U.S. at 380.

     Nothing in the record before us indicates any infirmity in 
the challenged Proclamations.  Each Proclamation identifies 
particular objects or sites of historic or scientific interest and 
recites grounds for the designation that comport with the 
Act's policies and requirements.  For example, Proclamation 
7320, 65 Fed. Reg. at 37,259, states that the Ironwood Forest 
National Monument "holds abundant rock art sites and other 
archeological objects of scientific interest."  And Proclama-
tion 7317, 65 Fed. Reg. at 37,244, states that the 164,000 acres 
that comprise the Canyons of the Ancients National Monu-
ment "is the smallest area compatible with the proper care 
and management of the objects to be protected."

     To warrant further review of the President's actions, Moun-
tain States would have to allege facts to support the claim 
that the President acted beyond his authority under the 
Antiquities Act.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a);  Papasan, 478 U.S. 
at 286;  Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  
Having failed to do this, Mountain States presents the court 
with no occasion to decide the ultimate question of the 
availability or scope of review for exceeding statutory authori-
ty.  The inadequacy of Mountain States' assertions thus 
precludes it from showing that the district court erred in 
declining to engage in a factual inquiry to ensure that the 

President has complied with the statutory standards.  Even 
assuming the correctness of Mountain States' contention that 
AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and 
Franke, 58 F. Supp. 890, require a detailed factual review in 
some circumstances, those cases are not relevant in view of 
the inadequacy of Mountain States' allegations.

                                B.

     Mountain States further contends, much as did appellants 
in Reich, that the Proclamations facially defy congressional 
intent regarding the scope and purpose of "a host" of other 
statutes enacted to protect various archeological and environ-
mental values.  Appellants' Br. at 5.  This contention, howev-
er, misconceives federal laws as not providing overlapping 
sources of protection.  Essentially, this contention parallels 
Mountain States' view of the limited scope of power delegated 
to the President under the Antiquities Act, specifically as not 
embracing environmental values.

     According to Mountain States, the Endangered Species 
Act, 16 U.S.C. ss 1532-44 (2000), is the "sole means" for 
protecting species and their habitat, and s 1133 of the Wil-
derness Act, 16 U.S.C. ss 1131-36 (2000), is the "sole means" 
by which the federal government may withdraw land from 
public use to protect scenic beauty, natural wonders, or 
wilderness values.  Appellant's Br. at 36, 37.  Yet the Park 
Service Organic Act, 16 U.S.C. 1-4 (2000), provides just one 
example of a statute that serves both purposes.  United 
States v. Brown, 552 F.2d 817, 822 (8th Cir. 1977).  So, too, 
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. ss 703-12 (2000), 
the National Wildlife Refuge System Act, 16 U.S.C. s 668dd 
(2000), the National Forest Management Act of 1976, Pub. L. 
No. 94-588, 90 Stat. 2949 (codified as amended in scattered 
sections of 16 U.S.C.) (2000), and the Bald and Golden Eagle 
Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. s 668 (2000), all guard endangered 
species and their habitat.  The Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act ("FLPMA"), 43 U.S.C. s 1701, the National 
Forest Management Act, and the Multiple Use Sustained 
Yield Act, 16 U.S.C. ss 528-29, 531 (2000), also protect scenic 

and wilderness values.  Consequently, Mountain States' con-
tention that the Antiquities Act must be narrowly construed 
in accord with Mountain States' view of Congress's original 
intent because Congress asserted its Property Clause author-
ity in enacting the FLPMA again misses the mark.

     Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.
