                            ---------

     Before Williams, Sentelle, and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.

     Per Curiam:  The Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America (hereinafter "INGAA" or "petitioner") moves for an 

award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $107,551.95 incurred 
in connection with its challenge to an Environmental Protec-
tion Agency ("EPA") regulation.  See Michigan v. EPA, 213 
F.3d 663 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Briefs with accompanying billing 
records have been submitted by the petitioner, and the EPA 
has filed its opposition.  After examination of the billing 
records and consideration of the EPA's objections, we find 
that INGAA is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees but not 
for the full amount sought.  We conclude, for the reasons 
stated below, that INGAA is entitled to an award in the 
amount of $65,947.24.

                          I. BACKGROUND

     In the underlying litigation, INGAA, a trade association 
representing major interstate natural gas transmission com-
panies in the United States, and other petitioners challenged 
promulgation of the EPA's "NOx SIP Call" final rule which 
mandated that 22 states and the District of Columbia revise 
their state implementation plans ("SIPs") to reduce emission 
of nitrogen oxides ("NOx").  The revisions were to be based 
upon state-specific NOx emissions "budgets" established by 
the EPA.  For its part, INGAA contended that the EPA, in 
its determination of the state NOx budgets, did not provide 
adequate notice and opportunity for comment on the control 
level assumed for large stationary internal combustion ("IC") 
engines (hereinafter referred to as the "control level" issue).  
Additionally, INGAA challenged the EPA's definition of large 
IC engines (hereinafter referred to as the "cut-off" issue).  
We agreed with INGAA on the "control level" issue and 
remanded it to the EPA for further consideration, but we 
upheld the EPA on the "cut-off" issue.  Id. at 693-94.

                           II. ANALYSIS

     INGAA now seeks an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 
Section 307(f) of the Clean Air Act, which provides:

     In any judicial proceeding under this section, the court 
     may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attor-
     ney and expert witness fees) whenever it determines that 
     such award is appropriate.
     
42 U.S.C. s 7607(f).  In our discussion below, we consider 
INGAA's fee petition and make certain deductions from it in 
light of the "reasonable" and "appropriate" standards set 
forth in the statute.

     Fees under Section 307(f).  The EPA argues that INGAA 
is not entitled to attorneys' fees in this matter because it did 
not achieve a sufficient degree of success in Michigan.  See 
Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 693-94 (1983);  see 
also Sierra Club v. EPA, 769 F.2d 796, 800 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  
Of the two challenges made by INGAA to the EPA's NOx 
SIP Call, the EPA argues that one, the IC engine "cut-off" 
issue, was completely rejected by the Court, while the other, 
the IC engine "control level" issue, was remanded, without 
being vacated, for further consideration by the EPA and was 
therefore a purely procedural victory insufficient to justify an 
award of fees.  The EPA further argues that even if it were 
to be assumed that INGAA is eligible to receive a fee award 
on the "control level" issue, since it lost on the "cut-off" issue 
then any fee award should be reduced by 50% to reflect that 
loss.

     In reply, INGAA claims that fees should be awarded not 
only for successful substantive challenges to rules, but also 
for valid procedural claims, because if this were not the case 
then "fees would become dependent on the essentially fortui-
tous presence or absence of a valid procedural claim" and "[i]t 
would be counterproductive ... to deny attorneys' fees for 
successful litigation to enforce" procedural regularity.  Brief 
of Petitioner at 5 (emphasis in original). INGAA further 
claims that Kennecott Corp. v EPA, 804 F.2d 763 (D.C. Cir. 
1986), governs the outcome here because the facts in that 
case "completely parallel" the one before us.  In Kennecott, 
according to INGAA, fees and costs were awarded to Kenne-
cott in litigation establishing that the EPA did not provide 

adequate notice and comment because certain data were not 
provided during the notice and comment period.

     The EPA argues in turn that the petitioner's reliance on 
Kennecott is misplaced because in that case, unlike here, the 
Court not only remanded the matter but also vacated the 
challenged portion of the regulation.  Instead, the EPA would 
have us rely on Sierra Club v. EPA and Environmental 
Defense Fund v. Reilly, 1 F.3d 1254 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  In 
Sierra Club, fees were denied for a remanded issue where no 
substantive relief was granted and the agency could possibly 
justify its position with no reformulation of the challenged 
rule.  769 F.2d at 806.  And the EPA relies on the Court's 
statement in Environmental Defense Fund that "a plaintiff 
that has obtained a remand for further proceedings is not at 
that point a 'prevailing party' for the purpose of collecting its 
attorney's fee."  1 F.3d at 1257.

     We note that the Court in Environmental Defense Fund, 
after making the statement relied on by the EPA quoted 
above, went on to explain that attorneys' fees may be award-
ed only if the plaintiff ultimately succeeds on the merits and 
that the rationale behind this rule was to avoid awarding fees 
for "corrective efforts that yield no real world benefit."  Id. at 
1257 (internal citation and quotation omitted).  Unlike Sierra 
Club, the underlying litigation in Environmental Defense 
Fund, as here, concerned a lack of public notice and com-
ment.  Specifically, the merits panel there vacated an EPA 
rule for want of notice and comment before promulgation.  
Although the EPA opposed an award of attorneys' fees in 
that case because it claimed, as it does here, that the petition-
er's victory was "purely procedural," the Court stated that 
even though the petitioner was not assured of being able to 
change the EPA's proposed regulation, having the chance to 
comment on the proposal was "in itself something of value in 
the real world."  Id.  So too here.  By obtaining the right to 
notice and comment on the IC engine "control level" issue, 
INGAA has achieved a sufficient degree of success on the 
merits to entitle it to an award of attorneys' fees.

     We further note that this Court has previously determined 
that a party is not entitled to attorneys' fees under Section 
307(f) for time spent on an issue on which it was wholly 
unsuccessful.  See, e.g., Sierra Club, 769 F.2d at 802.  IN-
GAA is therefore not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees 
on the IC engine "cut-off" issue.  INGAA does not dispute 
this and calls our attention to the deduction it has already 
made of 23% of the time spent on its merits and reply briefs 
($6,199.42), which it argues constitutes the amount of time 
spent on the briefs on the "cut-off" issue.  We find this 
amount to be a reasonable deduction and will make no further 
deductions concerning this issue.

     Fees for administrative proceedings.  The government 
claims that many of the attorneys' fees sought by INGAA 
were incurred in connection with its administrative petition 
filed with the EPA, and therefore fall outside the award 
parameters of Section 307(f).  We agree.  In Ruckelshaus v. 
Sierra Club, which also concerned a request for attorneys' 
fees filed pursuant to Section 307(f), the Court reminded us 
that "[e]xcept to the extent it has waived its immunity, the 
Government is immune from claims for attorney's fees.  
Waivers of immunity must be construed strictly in favor of 
the sovereign ... and not enlarge[d] ... beyond what the 
language requires."  463 U.S. at 685 (internal quotations and 
citations omitted).  As the language of Section 307(f) requires 
awards only for "costs of litigation," then fees incurred in the 
preparation of an administrative petition are excluded.  See 
Sierra Club v. Gorsuch, 672 F.2d 33, 42 (D.C. Cir. 1982), rev'd 
on other grounds, Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, supra (peti-
tioners seeking fees under Section 307(f) "not entitled to an 
award of attorneys' fees for their participation in the adminis-
trative proceedings preceding their appeal").  We will there-
fore make deductions for those entries referencing "petition."  
As many of these entries are grouped with other entries for 
the same date, for purposes of making the deductions we will 
assume that each entry for that date took up an equal amount 
of time. We will thus divide the number of entries for each 
date into the amount billed, and deduct that amount from the 
total amount petitioned.  See In re Pierce (Abrams Fee 

Application), 190 F.3d 586, 594 (D.C. Cir., Spec. Div., 1999).

     Fees for client service matters.  The EPA objects to ap-
proximately 20 hours of attorney time for certain entries that 
do not directly relate to litigation, i.e., entries having to do 
with retainer agreements, conflicts checks, strategy memos, 
and client updates.  INGAA replies that time spent on litiga-
tion strategy is indistinguishable from litigation itself and that 
time spent on keeping a client informed of the status of a 
matter, and similar tasks, are necessary and directly related 
to the litigation.  We find INGAA's argument to be reason-
able and will make no deductions for these entries.

     Fees for briefs.  The government challenges approximately 
110 hours that INGAA spent on researching and writing its 
briefs.  These hours are excessive, argues the government, 
particularly considering the approximately 125 hours spent on 
the preparation of INGAA's administrative petition which 
presented essentially identical arguments.  We agree that 
over two and one-half weeks of attorney time spent on briefs 
in this matter appears to be unduly high, and we will there-
fore make a downward adjustment for these fees.

     According to the government, no more than 40 hours for 
the opening brief and 20 hours for the reply brief should be 
allowed.  As we have already stated, many if not most of the 
billing descriptions submitted in this matter are scanty, and 
therefore it is difficult for us to make precise estimates of 
time spent on individual tasks.  It would appear, however, 
that of the approximately 110 hours spent on the briefs, 90 
were spent on the opening brief and 20 on the reply brief.  
As 20 hours of reply brief time appears to be reasonable, we 
will make no adjustment to it.  We will, however, reduce by 
one-half the 90 hours spent on the opening brief.  See Ameri-
can Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 72 F.3d 907, 917 (D.C. Cir. 1996) 
(excessive time spent on brief reduced by one-half).  In 
calculating the amount to be deducted, we will take the 
average of the billing rates of the two attorneys who worked 
on this matter and multiply this number by 45, producing a 
total deduction of $9,675.00.

     Inadequate documentation. The government argues that 
we should disallow much of INGAA's fee claim because the 
work descriptions in its billing entries are vague and contain 
no useful breakdown of professional time by task.  A review 
of the billings finds that there are indeed numerous deficient 
entries, such as those listed only as "conference calls" with no 
indication of who these calls were with or what they con-
cerned.  We have stated previously that "[s]uch description 
fails to provide the court with any basis to determine with a 
high degree of certainty that the hours billed were reason-
able," and thus cannot be charged to the taxpayers.  In re 
Donovan, 877 F.2d 982, 995 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quotation marks 
omitted);  see also American Petroleum Institute, 72 F.3d at 
915.  Additionally, there are several entries for conference 
calls with individuals referenced as "L. Beal," "P. Torangeau," 
"D. Malzahn," or "Perciasepe," who are not further identified 
in the petition.  As such, the reasonableness of these calls 
also cannot be determined.  In re Donovan, 877 F.2d at 995.  
We therefore must deduct the full amount of all these entries 
from the fee request.  We will make specific deductions using 
the process utilized for making deductions for "petition" 
references, supra.

     Notwithstanding the deduction of these wholly deficient 
entries, the billing documents are replete with instances of 
inadequately detailed descriptions.1  There are, in particular, 
__________
     1  See, for example, time entries for 1/13/99 ("Telephone confer-
ence with client;  conference with J. Knight");  1/14/99 ("conference 
with J. Knight;  review record");  1/15/99 ("Review materials;  con-
ference with J. Knight;  telephone conference with A. Field");  
1/17/99 ("Review record;  meet with J. Knight");  1/18/99 ("Review 
of record documents;  meet with W. Pedersen");  1/19/99 ("fax to J. 
Dreskin");  2/8/99 ("telephone conference with J. Dreskin");  2/9/99 
("telephone conference with P. Lacey and J. Dreskin");  2/12/99 
("confer with J. Knight");  2/18/99 ("confer with J. Knight");  2/23/99 
("Review record");  2/23/99 ("Record review");  2/25/99 ("confer with 
J. Knight");  2/26/99 ("Confer with J. Knight");  2/28/99 ("Confer 
with J. Knight");  3/4/99 ("telephone conference with A. Field of 
Hunton & Williams");  3/3/99 ("conference with J. Knight");  
11/17/99 ("Email to J. Knight regarding conference call");  11/18/99 

numerous entries concerning meetings and conferences that, 
although they include information concerning the identities of 
the individuals involved, are nevertheless devoid of any de-
scriptive rationale for their occurrence.  Therefore, as we 
have done in similar circumstances in the past, after all other 
deductions have been taken we will make a further deduction 
of 10% of the remaining billings.  See Abrams Fee Applica-
tion, 190 F.3d at 594;  In re Meese, 907 F.2d 1192, 1204 (D.C. 
Cir., Spec. Div., 1990) (per curiam).

     Fees for clerical tasks. The EPA claims that certain of 
INGAA's billing entries are for purely clerical tasks such as 
copying and pick up or delivery of documents, and are 
therefore not reimbursable because they ought to be consid-
ered part of normal administrative overhead.  We agree that 
four of INGAA's entries fall into this category.  On January 
28, 1999, Legal Assistant Lisa Edouard billed one and one-
half hours to "[f]ile documents at US Court of Appeals for J. 
Knight."  This is a task routinely performed by other less 
expensive personnel, such as messengers, and cannot be 
charged to the public fisc.  On March 24, 1999, Edouard 
billed one-half hour to "[r]eproduce and fed ex documents to 
EPA personnel for J. Knight."  She billed two hours on 
October 28, 1999, to "[o]btain" documents from the EPA.  
Likewise, on November 4, 1999, she entered a half-hour to 
"obtain" a Federal Register notice.  Again, such tasks could 
be undertaken by clerical, not legal, personnel, and we will 
deduct the full amount ($427.50) of these entries.  See Ameri-
can Petroleum Inst., 72 F.3d at 913;  In re Meese, 907 F.2d at 
1202-03.

     Fees for staff overtime. The government objects that fees in 
the amount of $679.20 for "staff overtime" should be disal-
lowed because such fees should more properly be considered 
as part of normal overhead.  We agree, and will deduct this 
amount from the fee request.  See In re North (Bush Fee 

__________
("Conference with J. Knight");  4/2/01 ("Conference with J. 
Knight");  4/8/01 ("conference with J. Knight").

Application), 59 F.3d 184, 195 (D.C. Cir., Spec.Div., 1995) 
(per curiam).

     Fees for document production. The government objects to 
INGAA's claim for $4,261.75 in "document production" costs 
because no further explanation for this category is given in 
the billing entries.  In the past we have made deductions for 
comparable fees because of a lack of supporting documenta-
tion, and we will do so here, reducing the amount by $2,000.  
See In re North (Gregg Fee Application), 57 F.3d 1115, 1117 
(D.C. Cir., Spec. Div., 1995);  In re Meese, 907 F.2d at 1204.  
Likewise, INGAA claims a total of $2,114.49 for computer 
research, which also lacks any supporting documentation, and 
we therefore will reduce this amount by $1,000.  Id.

     Fees for travel and long-distance expenses. The govern-
ment challenges INGAA's inclusion of $996.03 in travel and 
$396.86 in long-distance expenses, arguing that it is unclear 
how such fees could arise when INGAA and the EPA, as well 
as their attorneys, are all located in Washington, D.C.  In 
reply, INGAA informs us that most of these fees were 
incurred during the settlement negotiations, which included a 
trip to North Carolina where the EPA's technical staff is 
located.  We find this explanation reasonable and will make 
no deductions for these items.

     Fees for local transportation. INGAA claims $278.22 for 
"local transportation," with no explanation as to why this 
transportation was needed.  As we have stated in the past, 
we cannot assess the reasonableness of this item when it is 
otherwise not explained.  In re North (Shultz Fee Applica-
tion), 8 F.3d 847, 852-53 (D.C. Cir., Spec. Div., 1993) (per 
curiam).  We will therefore make a reduction for the full 
amount.

     Fees for fees.  In its fee petition, INGAA includes 43.5 
hours of attorney time for work done in connection with its 
fee petition, as well as 29.7 hours for time spent on its reply 
brief.  The government, although not disputing that "fees for 
fees" are recoverable under the CAA, see, e.g., American 
Petroleum Inst., 72 F.3d at 918, argues that the amount 
prayed for is excessive because, of the 43.5 fee petition hours 
billed, only nine were spent on preparing the petition per se 
while the remaining hours were spent on preceding unsuc-

cessful fee negotiations with the EPA which should not be 
reimbursable.  INGAA replies that the time spent preparing 
for the fee negotiation was also necessary to prepare the 
petition after the negotiations failed, and that much of the 
time spent negotiating was at the request of the government.  
We find INGAA's argument to be persuasive and note that 
the time requested is comparable to the amount of fee 
petition time we have allowed elsewhere.  Id.  We will there-
fore not make any deductions from the requested amount.

     Miscellaneous fees.  The EPA objects to approximately 40 
total hours of attorney time spent on various items that 
according to the EPA "do not appear to be associated with 
INGAA's claims in this litigation."  First, the EPA argues 
that fees for a stay motion that was never filed should not be 
awarded.  INGAA counters that the motion "was an integral 
part of INGAA's litigation settlement strategy because it 
increased INGAA's leverage with the agency," and that it was 
never filed because the state petitioners' stay motion was 
granted beforehand.  The EPA also objects to time spent on 
an economic incentives memo whose relationship to the case 
was not explained.  INGAA retorts that the memo concerned 
an analysis of market-based approaches to control of IC 
engines, and that such approaches were discussed during 
settlement talks.  Finally, the EPA takes issue with the time 
spent on research on ripeness, standing, and delegation is-
sues, none of which were ever raised.  INGAA replies that its 
strategy required it to analyze not only the issues that were 
eventually litigated but also issues that might be litigated, 
such as a possible government claim that INGAA did not 
have standing or that the case was not ripe since the SIP call 
did not directly require states to regulate IC engines.  For 
each of these items we find the petitioner's response to be 
reasonable and no deductions will be made.

                            CONCLUSION

     For the reasons set forth above, it is ordered that petition-
er be awarded $65,947.24 in reasonable attorneys' fees it 
incurred in connection with this Court's decision in Michigan 

and this fee petition.  The computation is set forth in the 
appendix.
