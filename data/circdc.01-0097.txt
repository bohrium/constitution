     Before:  Henderson, Tatel and Garland, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  The petition-
ers, Husqvarna AB et al. (Husqvarna), seek review of the 
Phase 2 Emission Standards for New Nonroad Spark-Ignition 
Handheld Engines promulgated by the respondent, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority 
of section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. s 7547.  
Husqvarna contends that the final rule is arbitrary and 
capricious because the EPA failed to select the emission 
standards that represent the best balance of the factors 
identified in CAA section 213.  It also maintains that the 
regulatory alternative chosen by the EPA is not supported by 
substantial evidence in the record.  Finally, Husqvarna alleg-
es procedural error stemming from inadequate notice and 
opportunity to comment.  Because each of these arguments 
lacks merit, we deny Husqvarna's petition.

                          I. Background

     In 1990 the Congress amended the CAA and added section 
213, which authorizes the EPA to set emissions standards for 
"nonroad engines and vehicles."  Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 
Stat. 2399 (1990).  Section 213 required the EPA to adopt 
emission standards by 1993 and to revise them as appropriate 
thereafter.  The EPA missed the statutory deadline and a 
lawsuit to enforce the statute was filed, which has resulted in 
the district court's monitoring of the EPA's compliance.  See 
Sierra Club v. Whitman, Civ. No. 93-0124 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 
19, 1993).

     In establishing emission standards, the EPA created two 
categories of small spark-ignition (SI) engines:  nonhandheld 

and handheld.1  The EPA further divided handheld engines 
into three classes--Classes III, IV and V--based on engine 
size, with Class III encompassing the smallest and Class V 
the largest handheld engines.  The domestic handheld engine 
industry includes 22 manufacturers, including Husqvarna, 
Stihl, John Deere, Shindaiwa, Kawasaski, Echo, Ryobi and 
Honda, which manufacture a total of 186 engine families.2  
These manufacturers primarily use two-stroke engines in 
handheld products because of their high power-to-weight 
ratios and low cost.  A two-stroke engine is an internal 
combustion engine that accomplishes the operations of intake, 
compression, expansion and exhaust in two piston strokes 
rather than four.

     The EPA has regulated emissions from handheld engines 
in two phases.  See 58 Fed. Reg. 55, 033, 55,034 (Oct. 25, 
1993).  In Phase 1, the EPA proposed short-term new engine 
standards based in part on standards California had adopted 
for similar engines.  In January 1998 the EPA proposed 
Phase 2 emission standards for handheld engines that were 
slightly more stringent than those in Phase 1.  63 Fed. Reg. 
3950, 3953-55, 3958-59, 3964-71, 4009-4013 (Jan. 27, 1998).  
The proposed Phase 2 standards were expected to reduce 
hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions 
by 30 per cent beyond Phase 1 standards by the year 2025.3  
63 Fed. Reg. 4001.  The proposal called for a reduction in 
emissions for Class III, IV and V engines to 210, 172 and 116 

__________
     1  Nonhandheld engines tend to be large and include engines 
that power lawnmowers and garden tractors.  Handheld engines 
are smaller and are used in equipment such as chainsaws, leaf 
blowers and weed trimmers.

     2  An engine family is a grouping of engines within a manufac-
turer's product line. Engines within the same family must be 
identical in several respects, including combustion cycle, number of 
cylinders, engine class, catalyst type, fuel required and useful life.  
40 C.F.R. s 90.116(c), (d)(1)-(10).

     3  HC and NOx contribute to the formation of tropospheric 
ozone through a complex series of reactions. Both short-term and 
prolonged exposure to ozone at levels common in many cities has 
been linked to a number of health problems.  See 65 Fed. Reg. 
24,268, 24,295 (Apr. 25, 2000).

grams per kilowatt-hour (g/kWhr),4 respectively.  In response 
to the proposal, the EPA received input from manufacturers 
indicating that lower emission levels were feasible.  See 63 
Fed. Reg. 66,081, 66,082-83 (Dec. 1, 1998).5  And in late 1998 
a portion of the handheld engine industry suggested that it 
would support final HC+NOx standards of 72 g/kW-hr for 
Classes III and IV and 87 g/kW-hr for Class V (72-72-87).

     On December 2, 1998 John Deere Consumer Products, Inc. 
(Deere), which appeared as an intervenor before this court, 
recommended that the EPA consider stricter Phase 2 stan-
dards in light of its recent development of "compression wave 
technology" (CWT), which promised to significantly reduce 
emissions from handheld engines.  CWT uses compressed air 
to improve fuel injection in the combustion chamber of a two-
stroke engine, resulting in almost all of the fuel being com-
busted.  Deere stated that CWT was adaptable to all sizes of 
two-stroke engines and could meet a 72 g/kW-hr HC+NOx 
standard in 2001.

     On July 28, 1999 the EPA published a Supplemental Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking (Supplemental Proposal), which pro-
posed emission limits of 50 g/kW-hr for Classes III and IV 
with phase-in between 2002 and 2006 and an emission limit of 
72 g/kW-hr for Class V with phase-in between 2004 and 2008.  
64 Fed. Reg. 40,940 (July 28, 1999).  In addition to CWT, the 
Supplemental Proposal identified three other technologies--
stratified scavenging,6 miniature four-stroke engines7 and cat-

__________
     4  Grams per kilowatt-hour (g/kW-hr) is used to measure the 
mass of pollutants (grams) emitted per quantum of work (kW-hr) 
the engine performs.

     5  "Lower" emission levels equate to stricter standards and 
presumably cleaner air.

     6  Stratified scavenging is a technique that lowers emissions 
from two-stroke engines by using pure air, instead of a mixture of 
fuel and air, to expel exhaust gases following combustion.  The air 
also serves as a buffer that prevents the air/fuel mixture from 
escaping the exhaust port.

     7  A miniature four-stroke engine performs the internal combus-
tion process using four strokes of the piston as opposed to the two 

alysts8--that could be utilized by manufacturers to meet the 
Phase 2 standards.  The Supplemental Proposal also con-
tained an averaging, banking and trading (ABT)9 program to 
give handheld engine manufacturers flexibility in meeting the 
more stringent Phase 2 standards.  64 Fed. Reg. 40,951.  
Under the proposed program, manufacturers would declare a 
family emission limit (FEL) for each engine family.  See 
supra note 2.  Manufacturers need only ensure that average 
emissions from all of their engine families meet the emission 
standards for the given model year.  They could also gener-
ate bankable emission credits based on the differences be-
tween the FEL and the Phase 2 standards for the applicable 
model year.

     Many manufacturers, including Husqvarna, commented on 
the Supplemental Proposal.  The public comment period 
closed on September 17, 1999, although the EPA agreed to 
consider additional comments filed within 30 days therefrom.  
It also continued to meet with interested manufacturers after 
the close of the comment period.  The final Phase 2 emission 
standards for handheld SI engines were published on April 
25, 2000.  65 Fed. Reg. 24,268.  In the final rule, the EPA 
adopted the 50-50-72 HC+NOx emission standards proposed 
in the Supplemental Proposal, but with an implementation 
schedule of four years instead of the five as proposed.  The 
decision rested on the EPA's determination that "rapid tech-

engines, which produce lower HC+NOx emissions due to their 
lower scavenging losses, have until recently been limited to ground-
supported applications such as lawnmowers.

     8  Catalysts are small devices that are added to an engine to 
oxidize or convert unburned hydrocarbons after they exit the en-
gine's combustion chamber.

     9  Averaging means the exchange of emission credits within a 
manufacturer's product line.  Banking refers to the retention of 
emission credits for use in future model year averaging or trading.  
Trading involves the exchange of emission credits between engine 
manufacturers that can then be used for averaging, banked for 
future use or traded again.  63 Fed. Reg. 3972.

nological advances" in the handheld engine industry warrant-
ed a more expeditious implementation.  65 Fed. Reg. 24,274.  
While noting that "not all of the technologies ... have yet 
been demonstrated in mass-produced production engines op-
erated under typical in-use conditions," the EPA identified 
the following technologies as likely to meet the newly adopted 
standards:  Class III (CWT & low-medium efficiency catalyst;  
stratified scavenging with lean combustion & medium-high 
efficiency catalyst;  four-stroke), Class IV (CWT;  CWT & low 
efficiency catalyst;  stratified scavenging with lean combustion 
& medium efficiency catalyst;  four-stroke) and Class V 
(CWT;  four-stroke;  stratified scavenging with lean combus-
tion).  65 Fed. Reg. 24,274-79.  The EPA explained that 
changes in equipment design could allay safety concerns 
about the use of catalysts.  65 Fed. Reg. 24,278-79.  It also 
determined that the Phase 2 standards were cost-effective.  
65 Fed. Reg. 24, 296-300.  Finally, the EPA revised the ABT 
program to avoid a delay in the shift to cleaner engines.  65 
Fed. Reg. 24,282-84.  Husqvarna challenges all of these parts 
of the final rule.

                           II. Analysis

     "Our analysis is guided by the deference traditionally given 
to agency expertise, particularly when dealing with a statuto-
ry scheme as unwieldy and science-driven as the Clean Air 
Act."  Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 135 F.3d 791, 801-02 
(D.C. Cir. 1998);  see Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. NRDC, 
462 U.S. 87, 103 (1983) (reviewing court must be "at its most 
deferential" when agency is "making predictions, within its 
area of special expertise, at the frontiers of science").  Under 
section 307(d)(9) of the CAA, we reverse agency action found 
to be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-
wise not in accordance with law."  42 U.S.C. s 7607(d)(9)(A).  
Questions of statutory interpretation are governed by the 
familiar two-step test set forth in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. 
NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).  The court first asks 
"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise ques-
tion at issue," in which case it "must give effect to the 
unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."  Id.  If the 

"statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific 
issue," the court moves to the second step and defers to the 
agency's interpretation as long as it is "based on a permissi-
ble construction of the statute."  Id. at 843.  We will strike 
down the rulemaking for procedural error "only if the errors 
were so serious and related to matters of such central rele-
vance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the 
rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had 
not been made."  CAA s 307(d)(8);  42 U.S.C. s 7607(d)(8).

     In challenging the EPA's handheld engine Phase 2 emis-
sion standards, Husqvarna raises three claims.  First, it 
asserts that the EPA's choice of the 50-50-72 emission stan-
dards contravenes the best balance requirement of CAA 
section 213.  Second, it maintains that the final rule is 
arbitrary and capricious because it is not supported by sub-
stantial evidence in the record.  Finally, it argues that the 
EPA failed to comply with the procedural requirements of 
CAA section 307(d).

     A.   CAA Section 213
          
     Section 213(a)(3) of the CAA requires the EPA to promul-
gate standards that "shall achieve the greatest degree of 
emission reduction achievable through the application of tech-
nology which the Administrator determines will be available 
for the engines or vehicles to which such standards apply, 
giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such 
technology within the period of time available to manufactur-
ers and to noise, energy, and safety factors associated with 
the application of such technology."  42 U.S.C. s 7547(a)(3).  
Husqvarna maintains that the 50-50-72 emission standards 
do not represent the "best balance" of these factors for the 
industry.  We disagree that a "best balance" of the kind 
Husqvarna contemplates is required.  The EPA did not devi-
ate from its statutory mandate or frustrate congressional will 
by placing primary significance on the "greatest degree of 
emission reduction achievable" and by considering cost, noise, 
energy and safety factors as important but secondary factors.  
The overriding goal of the section is air quality and the other 
listed considerations, while significant, are subordinate to that 

goal.  Cf. American Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, 
1120 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The record indicates that the EPA 
considered each of the factors listed in section 213 and 
nothing suggests that "the agency abandoned its obligation to 
balance the statutory factors and select the best balance for a 
predominant segment of industry from the alternatives before 
it."  Appellant Br. 37 (emphasis original).  Contrary to Husq-
varna's claim, the EPA did not single out a single engine 
technology and use it as a benchmark to set standards.  
Rather, it set the emission standards with four different 
engine technologies in mind.  Cf. NRDC v. Thomas, 805 F.2d 
410, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (rejecting petitioner's claim that 
EPA must determine which engine can achieve greatest 
emission reduction and then ratchet standard up to account 
for cost and other factors).

     Husqvarna argues that the EPA's failure to consider incre-
mental cost-effectiveness illustrates its erroneous interpreta-
tion of section 213.  Section 213, however, simply directs the 
EPA to consider cost.  Although the EPA considered margin-
al cost-effectiveness in promulgating marine engine emission 
regulations, it has not done so in promulgating any other 
standards under section 213.  Moreover, the EPA identified 
industry-specific factors in the marine engine rulemaking that 
suggested an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis would be 
particularly significant to the EPA's choice among various 
alternative standards.  61 Fed. Reg. 52,088, 52,098 (Oct. 4, 
1996).  The EPA did consider the cost-effectiveness study 
submitted by Husqvarna during the public comment period, 
JA 1885-88, but rejected it as a basis to conclude that the 
cost of the 50-50-72 standard was unreasonable.  Because 
section 213 does not mandate a specific method of cost 
analysis, we find reasonable the EPA's choice to consider 
costs on the per ton of emissions removed basis.  See 65 Fed. 
Reg. 24,300.  And there is no dispute that the EPA consid-
ered cost in this manner in weighing the factors under section 
213.

     Husqvarna also complains that the changes in the ABT 
program set forth in the final rule demonstrate improper 
balancing under section 213.  The record, however, indicates 

just the opposite.  It was the EPA's consideration of the 
factors listed in section 213, notably the mandate to consider 
the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable, that led 
to the changes in the ABT program.  We find nothing 
unreasonable about the EPA's conclusion that the ABT pro-
gram as proposed risked undermining the final rule by unnec-
essarily delaying the introduction of cleaner engine technolo-
gies.  65 Fed. Reg. 24, 284.

     In sum, we defer to the EPA's selection of emission stan-
dards under section 213.  The record shows that the EPA 
reasonably arrived at what it determined was the best regula-
tory standard by ascertaining the greatest degree of emission 
reduction achievable while giving appropriate consideration to 
cost, noise, energy and safety factors.

     B.   Substantial Evidence
          
     CAA section 213 is a technology-forcing standard.  See 42 
U.S.C. s 7547(a)(3);  42 U.S.C. s 7547(b).  In construing simi-
lar language included in CAA section 202, we explained in 
NRDC v. Thomas that the mere fact that the provisions "seek 
to promote technological advances while also accounting for 
cost does not detract from their categorization as technology-
forcing standards."  805 F.2d at 428 n.30.  The "Congress 
intended the agency to project future advances in pollution 
control capability.  It was 'expected to press for development 
and application of improved technology rather than be limited 
by that which exists today.' "  NRDC v. EPA, 655 F.2d 318, 
328 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (quoting S. Rep. No. 91-1196, at 24 
(1970)).  Husqvarna acknowledges that the statute is technol-
ogy-forcing but challenges whether EPA projections of future 
advances in pollution control capability are supported by 
substantial evidence.  It asserts that the EPA (1) selected 
emission standards that are not technologically feasible and, 
in so doing, (2) failed to consider costs, (3) did not adequately 
address safety issues and (4) provided no rational explanation 
for the phase-in period selected.  We find these claims with-
out merit.

     First, substantial evidence supports the EPA's determina-
tion that the Phase 2 standards can be achieved through the 

application of the identified technologies--CWT, stratified 
scavenging, miniature four-stroke engines and catalysts.  The 
record indicates that these engine technologies are already 
capable of meeting an emission limit of 72 g/kW-hr, with the 
four-stroke engine technology currently meeting the 50 g/kW-
hr standard.  The EPA found that the two-stroke technolo-
gies--CWT and stratified scavenging--can also currently 
meet the 50 g/kW-hr standard with the addition of a catalyst.  
Husqvarna offers no theoretical objections to the technolo-
gies' capacity to meet the emission standards within the 
phase-in period.  " 'In the absence of theoretical objections to 
the technology, the agency need only identify the major steps 
necessary for development of the device, and give plausible 
reasons for its belief that the industry will be able to solve 
these problems in the time remaining.  The EPA is not 
required to rebut all speculation that unspecified factors may 
hinder "real world" emission control.' "  Thomas, 805 F.2d at 
434 (quoting NRDC, 655 F.2d at 334).  Husqvarna criticizes 
the performance of the various engine technologies but can-
not show that the remaining issues related to design, imple-
mentation, mass production, performance, heat and weight 
cannot be solved through innovation and equipment redesign.  
It also questions the adequacy of the time period to solve 
these issues.  Substantial evidence, however, supports the 
EPA's determination that the continued rapid development of 
engine technologies makes it probable that CWT, stratified 
scavenging, four-stroke engine and catalyst technologies will 
enable manufacturers to comply with the emission standards 
within the phase-in period.  See 65 Fed. Reg. 24,274-81.

     Second, substantial evidence supports the EPA's cost de-
terminations.  The EPA sought comment on and considered a 
significant body of cost data, including an incremental cost-
effectiveness study submitted by Husqvarna.  JA 1883-93.  
The EPA calculated the cost per engine and measured the 
cost-effectiveness of the final Phase 2 standards, in dollars 
per ton of emissions reduction, against the Phase 1 baseline.  
65 Fed. Reg. 24,299-300.  Its calculation of $560 per ton of 
HC+NOx removed, with fuel savings, falls within the range 
of other nonroad mobile source regulations under Title II.  

See 63 Fed. Reg. 56,968, 56,990-91 (Oct. 23, 1998) (nonroad 
compression-ignition engines);  64 Fed. Reg. 73,300, 73,325-26 
(Dec. 29, 1999) (SI recreational marine engines).

     Third, contrary to Husqvarna's claim, the record illustrates 
that the EPA considered safety issues.  It considered the 
problem of heat associated with the use of catalysts and it 
proposed engine and equipment redesign to overcome the 
problem.  65 Fed. Reg. 24,278-79.  The EPA also investigat-
ed manufacturers' claims that replacing two-stroke engines 
with four-stroke engines would increase the weight of certain 
handheld equipment.  It found their fears largely unwarrant-
ed and determined that four-stroke engine technology was 
feasible in Class IV and some Class V applications.  65 Fed. 
Reg. 24,277.

     Finally, substantial evidence supports the phase-in period 
selected.  CAA section 213(b) states that "[s]tandards under 
this section shall take effect at the earliest possible date 
considering the lead time necessary to permit the develop-
ment and application of the requisite technology, giving ap-
propriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such 
period and energy and safety."  42 U.S.C. s 7547(b).  For 
the final Phase 2 standards, the EPA determined that the 
schedule of declining emission standards, to be phased in 
from 2002 to 2005 for Class III and IV and from 2004 to 2007 
for Class V, provides adequate time for manufacturers' transi-
tion to cleaner engine technologies.  The final rule basically 
shortened the implementation schedule from the five years 
proposed in the Supplemental Proposal to four years.  In so 
doing the EPA was responding to several commentators who 
sought the shorter time frame to avoid delay in the transition 
to cleaner technologies.  The EPA also considered the poten-
tial hardships on manufacturers of engine families with an 
annual production level of fewer than 5000 units and provided 
them additional lead time.  65 Fed. Reg. 24,289.  Additional-
ly, the EPA implemented an ABT program to give all manu-
facturers flexibility in meeting the implementation schedule;  
the program permits manufacturers to produce some engines 
that do not meet the standards so long as they can generate 
or obtain offsetting credits from engines certified below the 

standards.  65 Fed. Reg. 23,282-84.  These provisions mani-
fest that the EPA followed the congressional mandate embod-
ied in CAA section 213(b).  42 U.S.C. s 7547(b).

     Accordingly, we conclude that the final rule is supported by 
substantial evidence.

     C.   Procedural Errors
          
     Section 307(d)(9) of the CAA provides that a court may 
reverse agency action if it was promulgated "without observ-
ance of procedure required by law, if (i) such failure to 
observe such procedure is arbitrary or capricious, (ii) the 
requirement of paragraph (7)(B) has been met, and (iii) the 
condition of the last sentence of paragraph (8) is met."  42 
U.S.C. s 7607(d)(9)(D).  Paragraph 7(B) limits judicial review 
to objections "raised with reasonable specificity during the 
period for public comment," or on reconsideration if "it was 
impracticable to raise such objection within such time ... and 
if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the 
rule."  42 U.S.C. s 7607(d)(7)(B).  Finally, the last sentence 
of section 307(d)(8) provides that "[i]n reviewing alleged 
procedural errors, the court may invalidate the rule only if 
the errors were so serious and related to matters of such 
central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial 
likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed 
if such errors had not been made."  42 U.S.C. s 7607(d)(8).

     Husqvarna contends that the EPA failed to comply with 
section 307(d)(3)(a) of the CAA, which requires that a notice 
of proposed rulemaking "be accompanied by a statement of 
its basis and purpose" and "include a summary of [ ] the 
factual data on which the proposed rule is based."  42 U.S.C. 
s 7607(d)(3).  It also argues that the agency failed to comply 
with section 307(d)(4)(B)(i), which dictates that "all written 
comments and documentary information on the proposed rule 
received from any person for inclusion in the docket during 
the comment period shall be placed in the docket."  42 U.S.C. 
s 7607(4)(B)(i).  Husqvarna alleges that these failures denied 
it sufficient opportunity to comment on the relevant technolo-
gies as well as on the ABT program as it appeared in the final 
rule.  We find these claims without merit.  First, the Supple-

mental Proposal specifically referred to the technologies that 
would serve as the basis of the 50-50-72 emission stan-
dards--CWT, miniature four-stroke engines, stratified sca-
venging and catalysts.  Husqvarna and other manufacturers 
had ample opportunity to comment on the technologies.  In 
fact, the bulk of Husqvarna's substantive claims revolves 
around the EPA's treatment of the comments they in fact 
submitted.  The EPA even extended the time to accept public 
input until 30 days after close of the public comment period to 
provide manufacturers like Husqvarna with more opportunity 
to comment.  Second, Husqvarna had opportunity to com-
ment on the proposed ABT program.  The final ABT provi-
sions were a logical outgrowth of those proposed in the 
Supplemental Proposal, even though they were in part based 
on comments received during the 30 day extension period.

Am. v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1221 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  The 
Supplemental Proposal gave Husqvarna fair notice of the 
subjects and issues involved in formulating the ABT program.  
Likewise, the four-year phase-in period was a logical out-
growth of the proposed five-year implementation schedule.  
Finally, even if the EPA committed procedural error, Husq-
varna failed to show it was "so serious and related to matters 
of such relevance to the rule that there is a substantial 
likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed 
if such error[ ] had not been made."  42 U.S.C. s 7607(d)(8).  
Husqvarna was unable to establish a substantial likelihood 
that the rule would have been significantly changed if it had 
had an expanded opportunity to comment.  Accordingly, we 
find Husqvarna's claims of procedural error without merit.

                         III. Conclusion

     In sum, we reject Husqvarna's substantive and procedural 
challenges to the Phase 2 Emission Standards for New 
Nonroad Spark-Ignition Handheld Engines.10  Accordingly,
