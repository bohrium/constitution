     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  Tax Analysts, a publisher of tax 
material, sued the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the 
Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) under the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. s 552 (1994), and Inter-
nal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) s 6104, 26 U.S.C. s 6104 (1994), 
respectively, in an effort to obtain copies of a closing agree-
ment reached between the IRS and CBN in conjunction with 
CBN's filing for tax exempt status under I.R.C. s 501(a) and 
(c)(3), 26 U.S.C. s 501(a), (c)(3) (1994).  The IRS filed a 
motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), and CBN filed a motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The district court granted both 
motions.  Tax Analysts appealed.  While we affirm the dis-
trict court's dismissal of the action against CBN, we find the 
present record inadequate to resolve Tax Analysts' claim 
against the IRS, and remand for further proceedings.

                                A.

     CBN has been an organization exempt from taxation under 
I.R.C. s 501(a) and (c)(3) since 1961.  In 1985 and 1986, CBN 
allegedly engaged in political activities inconsistent with its 
status as a tax exempt organization, prompting the IRS to 
audit CBN and to examine CBN's continued eligibility for tax 
exempt status.

     On February 2, 1998, CBN filed with the IRS a Form 1023 
Application for Exempt Status.  On March 13, 1998, the IRS 
granted CBN's application retroactive to April 1, 1987.  On 
March 16, CBN issued a press release announcing that it had 
entered into an agreement with the IRS to conclude an audit 
and to preserve its exempt status.  Specifically, the press 
release indicated that the agreement entailed the loss of 

CBN's tax exemption for 1986 and 1987, the relinquishment 
of exempt status for three CBN affiliates, a "significant 
payment" by CBN to the IRS, and various other promises 
and modifications to CBN operations.

     On April 6, 1998, Tax Analysts sent a FOIA request to the 
IRS seeking a copy of the agreement between the IRS and 
CBN referred to in the press release;  any closing agreement 
relating to the issues described in the press release;  any 
written correspondence or memoranda of meetings or conver-
sations between the IRS and CBN pertaining to those agree-
ments or the press release;  and any renewal, revocation, or 
modification of any ruling granting tax exempt status to 
CBN.  A few months later, on June 29, 1998, the IRS 
responded and, citing FOIA Exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. 
s 552(b)(3), and I.R.C. s 6103, declined to disclose any of the 
requested information except the Form 1023 filed on Febru-
ary 2, 1998, and the March 13, 1998 determination letter from 
the IRS to CBN granting exempt status.

     On July 20, 1998, Tax Analysts sent a letter to CBN 
seeking the same information as requested from the IRS, 
citing I.R.C. s 6104 as the basis for its request.  Like the 
IRS, CBN declined to make available any documents other 
than the Form 1023 and letter from the IRS granting exempt 
status.  Shortly thereafter, Tax Analysts filed this action 
against the IRS and CBN seeking access to the requested 
records.

     As a general matter, FOIA provides for the disclosure upon 
request of government-held records and documents.  See 5 
U.S.C. s 552.  FOIA's general disclosure rule is subject to 
nine statutory exceptions, however.  See id. s 552(b).  The 
government bears the burden of proving that any requested 
documents it withholds fall within one of the nine exceptions.  
See id. s 552(a)(4)(B);  Petroleum Info. Corp. v. United States 
Dep't of the Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

     The exemption asserted by the IRS in this case, "Exemp-
tion 3," permits the withholding of government records "spe-
cifically exempted from disclosure by statute ... provided 
that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld 

from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on 
the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding 
or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld...."  
5 U.S.C. s 552(b)(3).  The I.R.C. explicitly provides for the 
confidentiality of tax returns and "return information."  
I.R.C. s 6103(a), 26 U.S.C. s 6103(a).  This court and others 
have recognized consistently that I.R.C. s 6103(a) is a non-
disclosure statute falling within the scope of FOIA Exemption 
3.  See, e.g., Church of Scientology v. IRS, 484 U.S. 9, 11 
(1987);  Lehrfeld v. Richardson, 132 F.3d 1463, 1466 (D.C. Cir. 
1998);  Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607, 611 (D.C. Cir. 
1997);  Aronson v. IRS, 973 F.2d 962, 964 (1st Cir. 1992).

     I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A), cited by Tax Analysts in its request 
to CBN, provides for the disclosure of certain documents 
relating to organizations exempt from tax under I.R.C. 
s 501(c)(3), like CBN:

     If an organization described in section 501(c) or (d) is 
     exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for any tax-
     able year, the application filed by the organization with 
     respect to which the Secretary made his determination 
     that such organization was entitled to exemption under 
     section 501(a), together with any papers submitted in 
     support of such application, and any letter or other 
     document issued by the Internal Revenue Service with 
     respect to such application shall be open to public inspec-
     tion at the national office of the Internal Revenue Ser-
     vice.
     
26 U.S.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A).1  I.R.C. s 6104 also requires an 
exempt organization to make available for public inspection a 

__________
     1 All editions of the United States Code since 1970 have actually 
read "any paper" instead of "any papers" as we set forth above.  
See 26 U.S.C. s 6104 (1970);  see also United States Code editions 
of 1976, 1982, 1988, and 1994.  However, the original language "any 
papers" was inserted into s 6104 in 1958, see Technical Amend-
ments Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-866, s 75(a), 72 Stat. 1606, 1660-
61 (1958), and appeared in the 1958 and 1964 editions of the United 
States Code.  The United States Statutes at Large are "legal 
evidence" of the law, 1 U.S.C. s 112 (1994), whereas the titles of the 

copy of its application for exemption, "together with a copy of 
any papers submitted in support of such application and any 
letter or other document issued by the Internal Revenue 
Service with respect to such application." 26 U.S.C. 
s 6104(e)(2)(A)(ii) (Supp. III 1997).2  We recognized in Lehr- 
feld that documents disclosable under I.R.C. s 6104 may 
contain material that otherwise constitutes "return informa-
tion" protected from disclosure by I.R.C. s 6103.  Lehrfeld, 
132 F.3d at 1467.  I.R.C. s 6104 therefore may be character-
ized as an exception to the exception from the general 
disclosure rule offered by FOIA Exemption 3 and I.R.C. 
s 6103.  The parties in this case agree that s 6104, where it 
applies, controls s 6103;  and we will assume as much for the 
purpose of this case.

__________
United States Code only serve as "prima facie" evidence of the law 
unless they are enacted as "positive law," in which case they too 
serve as legal evidence of the laws.  1 U.S.C. s 204(a) (1994);  see 
also Stephan v. United States, 319 U.S. 423, 426 (1943) (per curiam) 
(Statutes at Large prevail over prima facie portions of U.S.C.).  
The I.R.C. has been enacted as a separate code and is therefore 
positive law.  See Internal Revenue Code of 1954, ch. 736, 68A Stat. 
1 (1954).  Though both the Statutes at Large and I.R.C. could be 
said to be authoritative here, we use the "any papers" language of 
the original enactment appearing in the Statutes at Large.  The 
difference is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, and we will thus 
disregard an apparent scrivener's error made by a codifier without 
congressional direction.  Cf. United States v. Welden, 377 U.S. 95, 
98 n.4 (1964) (holding that a "change of arrangement" by a codifier 
to a section not enacted as positive law "should be given no 
weight").

     2 Legislation enacted in 1998 amended s 6104, repealing former 
subsections (d) and (e) and inserting a new subsection (d) that 
includes the public inspection requirement of former s 6104(e).  See 
Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, s 1004(b), 112 Stat. 2681, 
2681-888 to 2681-889 (1998) (codified at 26 U.S.C.A. s 6104 (West 
Supp. 1999)).  Although the amendment altered the statutory lan-
guage slightly, those changes are not relevant to the issue before 
us.  Accordingly, we need not and do not address those differences 
here.

     The IRS has declined throughout this litigation to disclose 
whether a closing agreement with CBN exists, and the dis-
trict court did not examine the documents in question before 
dismissing the complaint.  Instead, the court concluded from 
the pleadings that the information requested by Tax Analysts 
represents a closing agreement as defined by I.R.C. 
s 7121(a), 26 U.S.C. s 7121(a) (1994), and therefore consti-
tutes tax return information that as a matter of law is outside 
the scope of I.R.C. s 6104 and exempt from disclosure under 
FOIA Exemption 3 and I.R.C. s 6103.  Accordingly, the 
district court granted judgment on the pleadings as a matter 
of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) in 
favor of the IRS.

     With respect to the claim against CBN, the district court 
also concluded that I.R.C. s 6104 does not contemplate a 
private right of action to enforce the obligation of an applicant 
for tax exempt status to make its application papers available 
to the public.  Accordingly, the district court dismissed the 
action against CBN for failure to state a claim upon which 
relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 12(b)(6).  Tax Analysts appeals both the judgment 
and dismissal.

                                B.

     We first consider whether the information requested by 
Tax Analysts falls within the scope of I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A), 
and thus must be disclosed despite FOIA Exemption 3 and 
I.R.C. s 6103.  As noted above, I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A) specifi-
cally requires disclosure of the application for exempt status, 
"any papers submitted in support of such application," and 
"any letter or other document issued by the [IRS] with 
respect to such application."  Statutory phrases like "any 
papers" and "any letter or other document" suggest breadth 
within those delineated categories of disclosable information.  
Regulations promulgated by the Department of the Treasury 
reinforce this suggestion by providing both a list of applica-
tion materials, see Treas. Reg. s 301.6104(a)-1(d)(2), 26 
C.F.R. s 301.6104(a)-1(d)(2) (1999), and a catch-all provision 

stating that "any statement or document not described in 
paragraph (d) of this section that is submitted by an organiza-
tion in support of its application."  Treas. Reg. s 301.6104(a)-
1(e).  The catch-all provision further offers a legal brief as an 
example of a disclosable document.  See id.  Despite the 
breadth of I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A) and related regulations, 
however, it is also clear from the statute that not every 
document pertaining to an exempt organization that the IRS 
has on file falls within the provision's scope.  See, e.g., Lehr- 
feld, 132 F.3d at 1465-66 (concluding that I.R.C. 
s 6104(a)(1)(A) does not cover papers submitted by third 
parties because such documents are neither submitted by the 
applicant nor issued by the IRS).

     Beyond the obvious examples of the exemption application 
itself and the final determination letter issued by the IRS, the 
statute does not articulate exactly what constitutes a docu-
ment that "supports" an exemption application or is "issued 
...  with respect to" an exemption application.  Tax Analysts 
argues that an applicant might submit a closing agreement as 
a supporting document for an exemption application, and that 
both the closing agreement and documents generated in the 
process of negotiating the closing agreement might also be 
submitted by the applicant in support of or issued by the IRS 
concerning that application.  Also, Tax Analysts asserts that 
the IRS may possess legal briefs, letters, memoranda, and 
other papers submitted by CBN's attorneys, accountants, 
officers, or directors presenting arguments in favor of CBN's 
exempt status or explaining or excusing CBN's political activ-
ities.  Accordingly, Tax Analysts maintains that the district 
court erred in concluding that there was no set of facts under 
which Tax Analysts could state a cause of action under FOIA.

     The IRS, on the other hand, while not acknowledging 
whether the sought documents exist, takes the position that a 
closing agreement and its documentary precursors, by their 
very nature and regardless of their content, are return infor-
mation protected by FOIA Exemption 3 and I.R.C. s 6103, 
beyond the scope of I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A).  The IRS points 
to the list of application materials in Treas. Reg. 
s 301.6104(a)-1(d)(2), which includes particular types of docu-

ments and statements like the applicant's articles of incorpo-
ration and bylaws, financial statements, and organizational 
charts, but does not mention closing agreements.  See Treas. 
Reg. s 301.6104(a)-1(d)(2).

     If IRS forms and regulations require the filing of particular 
types of documents as part of an application for exemption, 
then clearly such documents are submitted in support of the 
application regardless of their content.  The converse, that 
other types of documents cannot be included in the statutory 
phrase "submitted in support of such application," does not 
necessarily follow.  While I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1) explicitly re-
quires disclosure of applications for exempt status and letters, 
the descriptions that define which documents and letters are 
disclosable--"in support of such application," and "with re-
spect to such application"--speak to content without limita-
tion as to type of document.  Also, the catch-all provision of 
Treas. Reg. s 301.6104(a)-1(e), by its express inclusion of 
other documents, denies the notion that the prescribed list 
represents the outer bounds of disclosability.  We note fur-
ther that I.R.C. s 6103(b)(2), in defining "return information," 
similarly uses descriptions of content rather than titles and 
labels to articulate which taxpayer records should be held 
confidential.

     The IRS has never denied that an applicant might submit a 
particular document both to negotiate a closing agreement 
and to support an exemption application where the two 
processes share overlapping issues.  Moreover, at oral argu-
ment, the IRS conceded that a closing agreement which 
would generally in its view be exempt from disclosure as 
return information nevertheless might become disclosable if 
submitted in support of an exemption application.  Precluding 
disclosure of a closing agreement, without regard to its 
content or circumstances, merely because it carries that 
particular label is therefore inconsistent with the statutory 
inclusion of "any papers submitted" and "any letter or docu-
ment issued."  Particularly in this case, where the press 
release suggests that the closing agreement and application 
for exempt status were part of a single, overall negotiation 
between the IRS and CBN, the IRS's rigid reliance on the 

type of documents at issue rather than their content is 
questionable.

     In arguing against remand for further discovery, the IRS 
relies heavily upon another case involving closing agreements, 
Tax Analysts v. IRS, 53 F. Supp. 2d 449 (D.D.C. 1999).  In 
that case, the district court granted summary judgment for 
the IRS on the ground that the closing agreements were not 
disclosable under I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A) because they were 
not " 'issued' by the IRS," but were instead bilateral contracts 
between the IRS and the applicants in question.  Id. at 453.  
Without endorsing this view of the meaning of "issued by the 
IRS," we note that the district court in that case conducted 
an in camera review of the agreements in question before 
concluding that they did not fall within the scope of I.R.C. 
s 6104(a)(1)(A).  That court based its decision principally 
upon "the character of the closing agreements themselves," 
id. at 453 n.6, explicitly leaving open the question of whether 
a closing agreement might itself constitute an application for 
exempt status disclosable under I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A).  See 
id. at 453 n.7.  In other words, far from supporting the IRS's 
argument that further discovery would be fruitless, that case 
better supports the conclusion that some review of the con-
tent of the documents in question is necessary before the 
court can adequately determine whether or not I.R.C. 
s 6104(a)(1)(A) applies.

     At bottom, the case before us does not present a disagree-
ment over the law to be applied, but the narrow and fact-
specific question of whether the closing agreement between 
the IRS and CBN and any accompanying documentation 
represent material discloseable under I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A), 
despite their apparent status as material exempt from disclo-
sure under I.R.C. s 6103.  As the present record is inade-
quate for such determination, further discovery is necessary.  
We therefore vacate the district court's judgment in favor of 
the IRS and remand for further proceedings consistent with 
this opinion.  We leave to the district court in the first 
instance the question of whether in camera examination or 
the filing of a Vaughn index is sufficient to create an ade-

quate record upon which to base the discloseability determi-
nation.

                                C.

     We turn next to Tax Analysts' claim against CBN.  The 
district court dismissed that claim after concluding that I.R.C. 
s 6104 does not contemplate a private right of action to 
enforce the public inspection requirement imposed upon ap-
plicants for tax exempt status.  I.R.C. s 6104 does not ex-
pressly provide for private action against exempt organiza-
tions that fail to make available their exemption applications 
and supporting documentation.  Indeed, the provision offers 
no language at all concerning remedies for its violation.  Tax 
Analysts argues that this omission does not preclude its cause 
of action against CBN for allegedly violating that statute's 
public inspection requirement, and that Congress intended a 
private remedy to effectuate the public inspection require-
ment.  CBN, unsurprisingly, maintains that I.R.C. s 6104 
does not support an implied private right of action.

     Although violation of a federal statute alone is inadequate 
to support a private cause of action, see, e.g., Touche Ross & 
Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 568 (1979) (quoting Cannon v. 
University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688 (1979)), the Supreme 
Court has repeatedly recognized that, in some cases, the 
courts may infer such a remedy from the language or struc-
ture of a statute or the circumstances of its enactment.  See, 
e.g., Karahalios v. National Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 
1263, 489 U.S. 527, 532-33 (1989);  Transamerica Mortgage 
Advisers, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 18 (1979).  The question 
we must resolve is whether Congress intended to provide a 
private remedy for violations of the public inspection require-
ment of I.R.C. s 6104.  See, e.g., Thompson v. Thompson, 484 
U.S. 174, 179 (1988);  Transamerica, 444 U.S. at 15.

     To answer that question, we turn to the long line of cases 
stemming from Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975).  In Cort, the 
Supreme Court articulated four factors for the courts to 
weigh in discerning congressional intent to provide an implied 
private right of action:  (1) whether the plaintiff is one of the 

class for whose benefit the statute was enacted;  (2) whether 
some indication exists of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, 
either to create or to deny a private remedy;  (3) whether 
implying a private right of action is consistent with the 
underlying purposes of the legislative scheme;  and (4) wheth-
er the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state 
law, such that it would be inappropriate for the court to infer 
a cause of action based solely on federal law.  See id. at 78;  
see also Suter v. Artist M, 503 U.S. 347, 364 n.16 (1992) 
(recognizing the four Cort factors);  Thompson, 484 U.S. at 
179 (expressing reliance upon the Cort factors).  Over the 
years, the proper application and continued vitality of Cort's 
four factors have been matters of great debate, as reflected in 
the parties' arguments.  Tax Analysts contends that we 
should mechanically consider and weigh each of the four 
factors, and cites numerous Supreme Court cases as support-
ing its position.  CBN maintains, conversely, that the Su-
preme Court has discarded step-by-step evaluation of the 
Cort factors, and cites as many cases sustaining its view.

     Turning to our own jurisprudence in this area, in Govern-
ment of Guam v. American President Lines, 28 F.3d 142 
(D.C. Cir. 1994), we reviewed Cort and its progeny and 
concluded that, in assessing whether Congress intended an 
expressly provided remedy to be the only remedy, "the 
central analysis is directed at discovering legislative intent by 
means of 'the language of the statute, the statutory structure, 
or some other source.' " Id. at 145 (quoting Karahalios, 489 
U.S. at 532-33).  We also acknowledged that, where Congress 
has otherwise enacted "a comprehensive legislative scheme 
including an integrated system of procedures for enforce-
ment," there is a strong presumption that Congress deliber-
ately did not create a private cause of action.  Id. at 145-46 
(quoting Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 
U.S. 134, 147 (1985)).

     Although I.R.C. s 6104 does not articulate a remedy for its 
violation, elsewhere in the tax code, Congress provided an 
enforcement mechanism of IRS-imposed civil fines and penal-
ties for s 6104.  See I.R.C. s 6652(c)(1)(C)-(D).  Additionally, 
current IRS regulations offer the public a mechanism for 

complaining to the IRS about an exempt organization's failure 
to comply with s 6104.  See 26 C.F.R. s 301.6104(d)-1(g).  
Although these regulations did not take effect until after Tax 
Analysts filed suit, we note that the IRS has long accepted 
information from third parties regarding taxpayers' failure to 
comply with the tax laws, even in the absence of a specific 
regulatory mechanism for doing so.  If ever a case demon-
strated a "comprehensive legislative scheme including an 
integrated system of procedures for enforcement," Govern-
ment of Guam, 28 F.3d at 145-46, it would be this one.

     Moreover, we note that the exempt organization is not the 
only source from which an interested party can obtain copies 
of the organization's exemption application and supporting 
documents.  As Tax Analysts' claim against the IRS amply 
demonstrates, I.R.C. s 6104 permits interested parties to 
gain access to the same documents from the IRS.  Addition-
ally, we note that I.R.C. s 6104(e) does not require an exempt 
organization to release for public inspection any document 
that the public could not otherwise procure from the IRS.  In 
other words, Tax Analysts achieves nothing through a private 
right of action against CBN that cannot be obtained from the 
government in the alternative.

     Our analysis comports with that of the only other courts to 
consider whether I.R.C. s 6104 creates an implied private 
remedy.  See Schuloff v. Queens College Found., Inc., 994 
F. Supp. 425, 427-28 (E.D.N.Y. 1998), aff'd, 165 F.3d 183 (2d 
Cir. 1999).  For all of these reasons, we conclude that I.R.C. 
s 6104 does not provide a private right of action, and affirm 
the district court's dismissal of Tax Analysts' claim against 
CBN.

                            Conclusion

     In summary, because we find the present record inade-
quate to determine whether the closing agreement between 
the IRS and CBN and any accompanying documentation are 
disclosable under I.R.C. s 6104(a)(1)(A), we vacate the judg-
ment in favor of the IRS on Tax Analysts' FOIA claim and 
remand for further proceedings, leaving to the district court 

the question of how best to create an adequate record.  We 
hold, however, that s 6104 does not provide Tax Analysts 
with a private right of action against CBN, and affirm the 
district court's dismissal of that claim.
