Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  Vencor, Inc., a provider of long-
term hospital care, filed a diversity action1 against Physicians 
Mutual Insurance Company, seeking reimbursement for ex-
penses incurred by 10 patients who stayed in six of its 
hospitals beyond the period covered by Medicare.  Each of 
the patients held "Medigap" insurance policies issued by 
Physicians Mutual;  Vencor sues as third party beneficiary.  
Among other defenses, Physicians Mutual claimed that cer-
tain provisions of the Medicare Act and associated regulations 
barred Vencor from charging patients more than the maxi-
mum rate for Medicare-covered hospital days--a rate at 
which Physicians Mutual had already reimbursed Vencor.  
The district court granted Physicians Mutual's motion for 
summary judgment on that limited ground.  Vencor, Inc. v. 
Physicians Mutual Insurance Co., 39 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 
1999).  Finding no such limitation in the cited provisions, we 
reverse.

                             *  *  *

     Medicare, like most health insurance plans, provides bene-
fits of limited duration.  For instance, it covers the first 90 
days of hospital care for every "spell of illness," plus an 
additional, non-renewable reserve of 60 days of coverage 
(which, until it is exhausted, can be added to any "spell of 
illness").  42 U.S.C. s 1395d(a)-(b), (g).  Once Medicare pa-

__________
     1 Vencor also claimed the district court had federal question 
jurisdiction, which Physicians Mutual disputed.  Given the presence 
of diversity jurisdiction, we need not reach the issue.

tients fully exhaust their government-provided hospital bene-
fits, see id. ss 1395c, 1395d, many rely on privately-
purchased "Medigap" policies for extended coverage.  These 
policies vary in their terms, but (as a result of a federal 
regulatory process that we will soon describe) all offer at 
least 365 days of post-Medicare hospital benefits.  See Medi-
care Program;  HHS' Recognition of NAIC Model Standards 
for Regulation of Medigap Policies, 57 Fed. Reg. 37,980, 
37,991/1 (1992).

     While the Medicare reimbursement rates of most hospitals 
are governed by the so-called Prospective Payment System, 
see 42 U.S.C. s 1395ww(d)(1)(B)(iv), Vencor, as an operator 
of long-term care hospitals, can secure reimbursement for the 
"reasonable cost" of providing its services.  Id. 
ss 1395f(b)(1), 1395x(v).  For Medicare-covered services, it 
must generally accept this amount as payment in full.  See 
id. s 1395cc(a)(1)(A).

     Vencor and Physicians Mutual filed cross motions for par-
tial summary judgment on the limited question of whether 
the Medicare statute or associated federal regulations prohib-
ited it from charging patients for post-Medicare services at 
more than the Medicare-approved rates.  We emphasize the 
word "patients" because much of the legislative and regulato-
ry materials that the parties dispute speak only to insurers' 
obligations.  Of course for a third-party beneficiary's breach 
of contract action, the patient's liability is the bedrock--
without patient responsibility, there is no insurer responsibili-
ty.  But insurer liability is often less than all of the primary 
obligor's;  provisions for deductibles and co-insurance are 
common, and some items and services may not be covered at 
all.  Such insurer-specific limitations may affect Physicians 
Mutual's liability on these 10 contracts, but no such limita-
tions are before us.  The cross-motions for summary judg-
ment frame the issue only in terms of patient liability.

                             *  *  *

     Physicians Mutual first argues that the Medicare Act itself 
prohibits Vencor from charging its patients more than the 

Medicare-approved rate.  It relies initially on 42 U.S.C. 
s 1395cc(a)(1)(A), under which providers are eligible for 
Medicare reimbursement only if they execute a contract with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services agreeing, 
among other things,

     not to charge ... any individual or any other person for 
     items or services for which such individual is entitled to 
     have payment made under this subchapter.
     
Id.

     The most obvious difficulty with this provision as support 
for Physicians Mutual is that it appears to have nothing to do 
with charges for post-Medicare services.  The "subchapter" 
(Subchapter XVIII, 42 U.S.C. ss 1395-1395ccc) contains pro-
visions under which providers are "entitled" to be paid by 
Medicare when their provision of services meets the many 
statutory qualifications.  These appear to exhaust its provi-
sion of entitlements.  Certainly Physicians Mutual points us 
to nothing in the subchapter that "entitles" providers to be 
paid for services provided after the lapse of Medicare entitle-
ment.  For such entitlements, presumably, they must rely on 
contract, or perhaps in some cases quasi-contract, under state 
law.

     Physicians Mutual seeks to get around this impediment by 
claiming that because provisions in the subchapter establish 
conditions under which the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners ("NAIC") may promulgate standardized Me-
digap insurance contracts, which under certain conditions 
become the exclusive form of lawful Medigap insurance con-
tract, see id. s 1395ss(p), the subchapter "entitles" providers 
to be paid for services falling in the Medicare gap.  But, 
skipping over the distinction between the liabilities of insur-
ers and of patients (recall that it is the latter that the parties' 
motions for summary judgment have put in play;  insurers' 
obligations follow only as a corollary), there is all the differ-
ence in the world between the contractual obligations of the 
common law, which create the entitlements of providers to be 
paid, and federal limitations on those entitlements.  Section 
1395ss does not entitle anyone to payment.

     In an attempt to sidestep these difficulties, Physicians 
Mutual argues that Medicare's general purpose of providing 
"basic protection against the costs of hospital ...  services," 
id. s 1395c, demonstrates a congressional intent to allow 
Medicare recipients to "extend the benefits and protections 
under the Medicare Act through the purchase of Medigap 
insurance."  Appellee's Br. at 15.  Even if Physicians Mutual 
were correct about the thrust of the statute's purpose, the 
Supreme Court has instructed that:

     [a]pplication of 'broad purposes' of legislation at the 
     expense of specific provisions ignores the complexity of 
     the problems Congress is called upon to address and the 
     dynamics of legislative action.  Congress may be unani-
     mous in its intent to stamp out some vague social or 
     economic evil;  however, because its Members may differ 
     sharply on the means for effectuating that intent, the 
     final language of the legislation may reflect hard-fought 
     compromises.  Invocation of the 'plain purpose' of legis-
     lation at the expense of the terms of the statute itself 
     takes no account of the processes of compromise and, in 
     the end, prevents the effectuation of congressional intent.
     
Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension 
Financial Corp., 474 U.S. 361, 373-74 (1986).  See also 
Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, 525-26 (1987) 
(noting that "no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs" 
and therefore "it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative 
intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the 
statute's primary objective must be the law").  So radical a 
scheme as imposition of price controls on medical services not 
covered by Medicare requires explicit language, not mere 
brooding purposes (which, we should add, are in any event 
not discernible in s 1395ss).

     Physicians Mutual also points to a specific provision of the 
Medicare statute governing "items or services ... in excess 
of or more expensive than" a covered service:

     Where a provider of services has furnished, at the re-
     quest of such individual, items or services which are in 
     excess of or more expensive than the items or services 
     
     with respect to which payment may be made under this 
     subchapter, such provider of services may also charge 
     such individual or other person for such more expensive 
     items or services to the extent that the amount custom-
     arily charged by it for the items or services furnished at 
     such request exceeds the amount customarily charged by 
     it for the items or services with respect to which pay-
     ment may be made under this subchapter.
     
42 U.S.C. s 1395cc(a)(2)(B).

     The parties curiously agree on the idea that this provision 
governs post-Medicare hospital days, differing only as to its 
effect.  We, by contrast, regard it as altogether inapplica-
ble--because confined to superior versions of covered ser-
vices.  (The parties' de facto stipulation of law does not 
require us to analyze a statute on a premise we regard as 
false.  See United States Nat'l Bank of Oregon v. Indepen-
dent Ins. Agents of Am., 508 U.S. 439, 446 (1993).)

     The archetypal example of a service that falls within the 
ambit of this provision is a medically-unnecessary private 
room requested by the patient instead of the semi-private 
room covered by Medicare.  In such cases, "the provider may 
bill the beneficiary for the difference between the private 
room and semi-private room charges."  Medicare Program;  
Elimination of Medicare Indirect Subsidy for Private Rooms, 
47 Fed. Reg. 42,676, 42,676 (1982).  More generally, HCFA 
has referred to items in services subject to s 1395cc(a)(2)(B), 
as "luxury items and services," see Medicare Program;  Pro-
spective Payments for Medicare Inpatient Hospital Services;  
Interim Final Rule with Comment Period, 48 Fed. Reg. 
39,752, 39,786/3 (1983), or as "partially covered" items and 
services, see Medicare as Secondary Payer and Medicare 
Recovery Against Third Parties, 54 Fed. Reg. 41,716, 41,740, 
41,743 (1989).  The additional days of hospital coverage at 
issue here do not fit these descriptions.  Indeed, in search of 
its desired result, Physicians Mutual is driven to offer a 
thoroughly confusing and improbable view of 
s 1395cc(a)(2)(B).  Physicians Mutual assumes that hospital 
services for pre-and post-exhaustion days are identical and 
that the "amount customarily charged" is the Medicare rate 

because that rate is paid by the majority of Vencor's patients.  
But after fitting these assumptions into the statutory lan-
guage, the upshot is that providers would have to offer free 
hospital stays to post-exhaustion patients, as the difference 
between the two "amounts customarily charged" is zero.  
(Insurance would be no help to the provider, as insurers are 
obligated to pay only to the extent that the patient is.)

     By contrast, applying the statute is simple in the case of a 
patient-requested luxury good or service.  For example, if a 
provider offers a "standard appendectomy" at a customary 
charge of $400 (for which Medicare reimbursement is limited 
to $300), and a "super appendectomy" at a customary charge 
of $600, it would be entitled to charge only $500 (the basic 
$300 Medicare rate, plus the $200 premium) for the superior 
procedure.

     Moreover, the triggering fact, the furnishing of such a 
service "at the request" of the recipient, seems to confirm our 
reading;  the risk that services would be provided long past 
the Medicare limit, without a request, seems very limited 
(though not zero).  The Secretary's implementing regulation 
not only requires patient request, see 42 CFR s 489.32(a)(2), 
but also requires the provider to inform the beneficiary that 
there will be a charge for the service "[t]o avoid misunder-
standing," id. s 489.32(a)(3).  It is hard to imagine that an 
extended hospital stay of several months' duration (which is 
the amount that would be "in excess of" Medicare benefits for 
most of the patients here) is the type of items or services for 
which a patient might fail to understand that "there will be a 
specified charge for that service."  Id.

     The statutes being rather unpromising material for Physi-
cians Mutual, it turns to a "Model Regulation" written by 
NAIC.  Again Physicians Mutual encounters a statutory diffi-
culty:  the authorizing legislation calls for regulation only of 
insurance contracts, not providers' services or compensation.  
See 42 U.S.C. s 1395ss(p).  NAIC was to amend its existing 
Model Regulation to include no more than ten standardized 
Medigap insurance plans.  See id. s 1395ss(p)(1)(A).  Each 
plan was to include a minimum common core of benefits and 
offer benefits widely available in then-existing policies, while 

balancing the objectives of simplifying the market for Medi-
gap insurance, avoiding adverse selection, providing consumer 
choice, providing market stability, and promoting competition.  
See id. s 1395ss(p)(2)-(3).  As a result of the statutory pro-
gram, no Medigap policy may issue unless either the relevant 
state insurance regulator, or in some circumstances the Sec-
retary, has a mechanism for ensuring that the policy meets 
the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation.2  See id. s 1395ss(a)(2), 
(g)(2)(A), (k)(1)(A), (m), (p)(1).  Physicians Mutual identifies 
nothing in the authorizing statute governing provider-patient 
charges, and we see no such grant of power to NAIC.  If the 
Model Regulation purported to cover such charges, it would 
be ultra vires.

     Unsurprisingly then, the text of NAIC's Model Regulation 
does not purport to cover such charges.  The section relied 
on by Physicians Mutual reads as follows:

     Section 8.  Benefit Standards for Policies or Certificates 
     ...
     
          B. Standards for Basic ("Core") Benefits Common to 
     All Benefit Plans.  Every issuer shall make available a 
     policy or certificate including only the following basic 
     "core" package of benefits to each prospective in-
     sured....

          hospitalization paid at [rates consistent with the ordi-
          nary hospital payment scheme] or other appropriate 
          standard of payment, subject to a lifetime maximum 
          benefit of an additional 365 days.

     Someone at NAIC has argued that this precludes provider 
charges above the Medicare rate because such charges are

("1998 NAIC Letter"), reprinted in Joint Appendix ("J.A.") 
123, 127.  But s 8(B)(3), like s 1395ss(p), makes no mention 
of limits on provider charges.

     Perhaps recognizing that s 8(B)(3) applies only to insurers' 
obligations, Physicians Mutual turns to the Model Regula-
tion's mandatory disclosure provision to support its claim.  
Section 16 states, in relevant part:

57 Fed. Reg. at 37,997, 37,998, 38,000, 38,001.

     Physicians Mutual points to the "YOU PAY" column of this 
table, which seems to say that the beneficiary pays "$0" for 
an additional 365 days of post-exhaustion hospitalization.  57 
Fed. Reg. at 38,001, 38,003, 38,005, 38,008, 38,011, 38,014, 
38,017, 38,020, 38,023, 38,027.  The question posed is whether 
the table has any legal effect on providers' charges.
     As a matter of federal law, the answer must be No.  As we 
have seen, the authorization in s 1395ss(p) to NAIC (and to 
the Secretary as an alternative reviser of the Model Regula-
tion) is confined to insurance contracts.  Authority to create a 
class of standardized insurance contracts does not carry some 
implicit authority to regulate transactions that give rise to the 
potentially covered obligations.
     The parties have nonetheless hotly disputed the meaning of 
various expressions of opinion by representatives of NAIC 
and the Secretary.  Physicians Mutual relies heavily on the 
1998 NAIC letter in which a NAIC official claimed that 
HCFA, "by adopting the NAIC Model Act and Regulation as 
the federal standard for Medicare supplement insurance," has 
embraced s 16 of the Model Regulation, which "in substance 
limits the providers to charging only the Medicare-approved 
amount for hospitalization when Medicare benefits have been 
exhausted."  1998 NAIC Letter at 4, 5, J.A. at 126, 127.  The 
1998 NAIC Letter relies in part on a 1992 letter in which 

Thomas Hoyer, a HCFA official, interpreted the "day outlier" 
language in s 8(B)(3) of the Model Regulation.  Letter from 
Thomas E. Hoyer, Jr., Director, Division of Provider Services 
Coverage Policy, HCFA, to F. David Wythe, Insurance Ana-
lyst, Forms and Rates Section, Life, Accident and Health 
Division, South Carolina Department of Insurance at 3 (Feb. 
12, 1992), J.A. at 136.  Vencor, however, notes that just seven 
months earlier, NAIC had quite candidly admitted that it 
"cannot control what providers charge for their services" and 
asked HCFA to take action to ensure that providers accept 
the Medicare approved rates as payment in full for post-
exhaustion hospital expenses.  Letter from Glenn Pomeroy, 
Chair, NAIC Senior Issues Task Force to Nancy-Ann Min 
DeParle, HCFA Administrator at 3 (Dec. 3, 1997), J.A. at 129, 
131.  Vencor also offers a more recent letter from HCFA in 
which the Deputy Administrator stated that neither Mr. 
Hoyer nor anyone else at HCFA has taken a position as to 
the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation's effects on providers' 
charges for post-exhaustion hospital care.  See Letter from 
Michael Hash, HCFA Deputy Administrator to Bradley L. 
Kelly, Mintz, Levin, Cohen, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo at 2-3 
(Sept. 14, 1999).

     To the extent that any of these letters attributes to s 16 of 
the Model Regulation any limitation on provider charges to 
patients, they exceed the unambiguous limits in the statutory 
sections relied upon.  Thus, even if we were to assume that 
NAIC--a private entity--were entitled to deference, or that 
the Secretary were owed deference on her interpretation of 
regulations drafted not by her but by NAIC, compare Thom-
as Jefferson University v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 510, 512-13 
(1994), the complete absence of statutory authority, even 
assuming the full application of deference under Chevron 
U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984), 
would fatally undercut the interpretation claimed by Physi-
cians Mutual.3

__________
     3 Thus we have no occasion to consider the effect of the Su-
preme Court's recent decision in Christensen v. Harris County, No. 
98-1167, slip op. (U.S. May 1, 2000) <http:  //www.supremecourtus. 
gov/opinions/99pdf/98-1167.pdf>, stating that when an agency 

     In theory the following question remains:  If a state adopts 
the Model Regulation in order to make the sale of Medigap 
policies lawful under federal law within its borders, could the 
text of s 16(C) have the effect asserted by Physicians Mutu-
al?  Recall that s 16(C) is simply a mandatory disclosure 
provision in a contract between patient and insurer.  As such, 
it would seem a weak basis for a claim of a binding restraint 
on contracts between patients and providers.

     Further, the language required by s 16(C)(4) itself explains 
that its purpose is simply to enable the insured to compare 
premiums and benefits (which are plainly independent of 
providers' rates), and warns patients (1) that the policy rather 
than the outline determines coverage, and (2) that the policy 
may not cover all of the patient's medical costs.  Compare 
Vencor Hosps. South v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of R.I., 
86 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1159-60 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (concluding that 
under Florida Law the outline is not part of the insurance 
policy);  Vencor, Inc. v. Standard Life & Accident Ins. Co., 65 
F. Supp. 2d 573, 578 (W.D. Ky. 1999) (same for Tennessee 
law).  As Physicians Mutual has invoked the Model Regula-
tion solely as a matter of federal law, however, disputes as to 
its meaning under state law are not before us.

     Finally, we note that in denying Vencor's motion under 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment, the 
district court said that Vencor had waived its claim that the 
1991 NAIC Model Regulation is inapplicable to the six pa-
tients whose policies took effect before August 21, 1992.  It is 
not clear whether the district court would reach the same 
conclusion in light of our decision that the authorities invoked 
by Physicians Mutual do not bar Vencor from charging 
patients its standard rates for post-exhaustion hospital care.  

__________
provides interpretations of an ambiguous statute in documents that 
lack the force of law (such as opinion letters and policy statements), 
such intepretations "do not warrant Chevron-style deference," id. at 
10, but are " 'entitled to respect' under ... Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 
323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), but only to the extent that those intepreta-
tions have the 'power to persuade,' " id. at 11.

To avoid confusion, we emphasize that the claim remains live.  
If the district court on remand is called upon to interpret the 
individual insurance contracts, and if it concludes that any 
version of NAIC's Model Regulation has any impact on the 
outcome, it must determine which version was in effect in 
each relevant state at the time that each contract took effect.

     Because we find no statute or regulation that prohibits 
Vencor from charging its standard rates to patients who have 
exhausted their Medicare hospital benefits, we reverse the 
judgment of the district court and remand the case.
