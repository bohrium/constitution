     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  In the consolidated cases of 
Independent Petroleum Association of America v. Babbitt 
and Samedan Oil Corp. v. Deer, 92 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 
1996), we held that (1) a policy letter written by an Associate 
Director of the Minerals Management Service clarifying the 
royalty consequences of take-or-pay settlement payments was 
not a rule subject to the notice-and-comment requirements of 
the Administrative Procedure Act;  and (2) the decision of an 
Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior in 
Samedan Oil Corp., MMS-94-0003-IND (Sept. 16, 1994), was 
arbitrary and capricious.  On remand, the District Court 
granted in part Samedan Oil Corporation's ("Samedan") mo-
tions for entry of an order implementing the mandate of this 
Court and for injunctive relief, Independent Petroleum Ass'n 
of Am. v. Babbitt, 971 F. Supp. 19, 35-36 (D.D.C. 1997), but 
denied a similar motion made by the Independent Petroleum 
Association of America ("IPAA"), see id. at 30, 35.  The 
District Court concluded that IPAA was not a party to 
Samedan's case and that IPAA's remaining claim--a "general 
challenge to the authority of [the Department of the Interior] 
to charge" royalties on nonrecoupable take-or-pay settlement 
payments--did not challenge final agency action.  Id. at 26.  
Accordingly, the District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction 
over IPAA's claim and therefore dismissed its complaint.  
IPAA now returns to this Court asking us to reverse the 
lower court's decision.  For the reasons set forth below, we 
affirm.

                          I. BACKGROUND

     The instant appeal continues a long history of litigation 
focusing on whether the Department of the Interior ("DOI") 
should be permitted to collect royalties from gas-producing 
companies that lease land from DOI when those companies 

receive payments based on their take-or-pay settlement 
agreements with gas pipelines.1  DOI initially took the posi-
tion that under its gross proceeds rule, see 30 C.F.R. 
ss 206.151, .152(h), .153(h) (1987), gas producers owed royal-
ties for receiving such payments.  In 1988, the Fifth Circuit 
rejected this position, holding that "[r]oyalty payments are 
due only on the value of minerals actually produced, i.e., 
physically severed from the ground.  No royalty is due on 
take-or-pay payments unless and until gas is actually pro-
duced and taken."  Diamond Shamrock Exploration Co. v. 
Hodel, 853 F.2d 1159, 1168 (5th Cir. 1988).  DOI subsequently 
amended the gross proceeds rule to reflect this holding, 
"remov[ing] the requirement to pay royalties on take-or-pay 
payments at the time the payment is made" but continuing to 
require royalties "when make-up gas is taken."  Revision of 
Gross Proceeds Definition in Oil and Gas Valuation Regula-
tions, 53 Fed. Reg. 45,082, 45,083 (Nov. 8, 1988).  In a May 3, 
1993 letter, the Associate Director of DOI's Minerals Man-
agement Service ("MMS") sought to clarify the gross pro-
ceeds rule, stating that "some or all of a settlement payment 
is or will become royalty bearing if production to which 
specific money is attributable occurs."  Letter from James W. 
Shaw, Associate Director for Royalty Management, MMS, 
addressed to "Payor" (May 3, 1993) [hereinafter May 1993 
letter].  In other words, according to the letter, "the only 
relevant question is whether or not the gas which was origi-
nally spoken for in the settled contracts is eventually sold to 
someone."  Independent Petroleum Ass'n of Am. v. Babbitt 
("IPAA I"), 92 F.3d 1248, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (emphasis in 
original).

     In August 1993, the Independent Petroleum Association of 
America, an association of roughly 5,000 independent explor-
ers and producers of natural gas and oil, responded to the 
letter by filing a suit seeking injunctive relief to prevent DOI

form the basis for this litigation and the history of the take-or-pay 
settlements at issue, see Independent Petroleum Association of 
America v. Babbitt ("IPAA I"), 92 F.3d 1248, 1251-53 (D.C. Cir. 
1996).

from collecting royalties on unrecoupable take-or-pay settle-
ment payments.  IPAA's complaint argued, inter alia, that 
(1) DOI adopted a new rule through the May 1993 letter 
without following the notice-and-comment procedures re-
quired by the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), 5 
U.S.C. s 553, and (2) DOI's efforts to collect royalties based 
on the settlement agreements violated the statutes governing 
the royalties owed under DOI leases.  In 1994, in an effort to 
"simplify ...  some of the procedural aspects of [ ] the IPAA 
Litigation," DOI and IPAA entered an agreement whereby 
MMS would issue up to 10 orders to companies to pay 
royalties based on their settlement agreements.  Agreement, 
Independent Petroleum Ass'n of Am. v. Babbitt, No. 93-2544 
(D.D.C. Feb. 4, 1994).  The companies could then appeal 
these orders to an Assistant Secretary of DOI, who would 
issue decisions that could become "appropriate vehicles to 
seek judicial review on the merits of the May [1993] Letter."  
Id. at 5.

     Later that year, MMS issued an order to Samedan Oil 
Corporation requiring it to pay royalties on settlement pay-
ments made by Southern Natural Gas Company.  Samedan 
appealed the order to DOI's Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs.  The Assistant Secretary upheld the order based on 
the policies articulated in the May 1993 letter.  See Samedan 
Oil Corp., MMS-94-0003-IND (Sept. 16, 1994).  Samedan 
appealed to the District Court seeking judicial review of the 
Assistant Secretary's decision.  Then, as we explained in 
IPAA I, "the District Court consolidated Samedan's challenge 
with IPAA's challenge to the May 1993 letter."  IPAA I, 92 
F.3d at 1255.  After the District Court granted summary 
judgment for DOI in both cases, Samedan and IPAA appeal-
ed to this Court.

     On appeal, we reversed the District Court's granting of 
summary judgment, holding that (1) the May 1993 letter was 
not a "rulemaking requiring APA notice-and-comment proce-
dures," id. at 1256, and (2) the Assistant Secretary's Same-
dan decision was "arbitrary and capricious in light of DOI's 
adoption of the Diamond Shamrock holding," id. at 1260.  

Accordingly, we held that DOI was precluded from collecting 
royalty payments from Samedan.  See id.

     On remand, IPAA and Samedan filed motions with the 
District Court seeking an order implementing the "mandate 
of the court of appeals" and a permanent injunction against 
DOI from collecting royalties from Samedan.  Independent 
Petroleum Ass'n of Am. v. Babbitt, 971 F. Supp. 19, 23 
(D.D.C. 1997).  The District Court granted Samedan's motion 
for injunctive relief, see id. at 36, and denied IPAA's motion 
to implement this Court's mandate, see id. at 30, 35.  In 
denying IPAA's motion, the District Court ruled that our 
decision in IPAA I only addressed IPAA's claim concerning 
MMS's May 1993 letter, not its "wide-ranging" complaint 
concerning DOI's efforts to collect royalties based on take-or-
pay settlement agreements.  See id. at 26.  The District 
Court explained that our holding concerning the Assistant 
Secretary's Samedan decision extended only to Samedan, not 
to IPAA.  Noting that IPAA had not sought to join Same-
dan's case, the District Court reasoned that IPAA could not 
"be considered a true party to Samedan's case, but must 
stand or fall on its own."  Id.  Consistent with this reasoning, 
the District Court reviewed whether it had jurisdiction to 
hear IPAA's broad challenge to DOI's royalty policy.  Al-
though recognizing that further administrative review would 
be futile in light of DOI's insistence that it would continue to 
apply the policies underlying the May 1993 letter, the Court 
ultimately ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because IPAA does 
"not face any final actions which [it] may challenge."  Id. at 
30.  Accordingly, the District Court dismissed IPAA's claim.  
IPAA appeals from this ruling.

                           II. ANALYSIS

     DOI contends that the issues raised by IPAA are not 
properly before this Court.  Following the District Court's 
dismissal of its claim, IPAA filed a motion pursuant to Rule 
59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure asking the 
District Court to amend its judgment, arguing that "nothing 
in the law of the D.C. Circuit conflicts" with adopting a 

futility exception to the finality requirement.  Independent 
Petroleum Ass'n of Am. v. Babbitt, 178 F.R.D. 323, 324 
(D.D.C. 1998) (mem.).  IPAA suggested that in its case 
"futility should create finality and subject matter jurisdic-
tion."  Id.  The District Court denied this motion, concluding 
that our Circuit has constrained the futility exception to the 
requirement of exhausting administrative remedies before 
seeking judicial review.  See id. at 324-25.  The Court noted 
that IPAA's argument "conflate[d] the doctrines of finality 
and exhaustion," id. at 324, and held that "futility cannot 
create agency action for purposes of jurisdiction," id. at 326.

     IPAA's Notice of Appeal states that IPAA appeals from the 
District Court's order "denying plaintiffs' motion to alter or 
amend the judgment dismissing the complaint."  DOI points 
out that the arguments IPAA makes on appeal deal solely 
with the District Court's dismissal of its complaint, not its 
Rule 59(e) motion.  Because IPAA's Notice of Appeal refers 
only to the District Court's denial of this motion without 
referencing the dismissal of its complaint, DOI suggests that, 
in light of Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, IPAA's arguments concerning the dismissal of its 
claim are not properly before us.

     Under Rule 3(c), a notice of appeal must "designate the 
judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed."  Fed. R. 
App. P. 3(c)(1)(B).  Nevertheless, a party's failure to designate 
the proper order it intends to appeal is "not necessarily fatal."  
Martin v. FERC, 199 F.3d 1370, 1372 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  As 
we have explained, "a party may demonstrate its intention to 
appeal from one order despite referring only to a different 
order in its petition for review if the petitioner's intent can be 
fairly inferred from the petition or documents filed more or 
less contemporaneously with it."  Id. (internal quotes omit-
ted).  Furthermore, without a showing of prejudice by the 
appellee, technical errors in the notice of appeal are consid-
ered harmless.  See McLaurin v. Fischer, 768 F.2d 98, 102 
(6th Cir. 1985) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181 
(1962)).

     We conclude that the arguments raised by IPAA concern-
ing the District Court's dismissal of its complaint are properly 
before us.  IPAA's intention to appeal from the actual dis-
missal is clear.  In the Non-Binding Statement of Issues to 
be Raised, IPAA explicitly stated one issue as "[w]hether ... 
the district court erred in dismissing appellants' complaint 
with prejudice on the grounds that they had not complained 
of 'final' agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. s 704."  
J.A. at 300.  It is also worth underscoring that DOI does not 
claim that it was prejudiced by IPAA's referring to the wrong 
order in its Notice of Appeal.  See Martin, 199 F.3d at 1373 
(noting that appellee did not "claim to suffer any prejudice").  
Not only did DOI fully brief the merits of the District Court's 
dismissal of IPAA's claim, but its earlier filings demonstrate 
that it understood the true nature of IPAA's appeal.  For 
example, in one responsive document it noted that one issue 
before the Court is "the import of this Court's decision in 
IPAA v. Babbitt and whether injunctive relief is appropriate."  
Federal-Appellees' Consolidated Response to Appellants' Re-
sponse to Order to Show Cause at 5, Shell Offshore, Inc. v. 
Department of the Interior, No. 98-5116 (D.C. Cir. 2000)2;  cf. 
Foman, 371 U.S. at 181 ("[B]oth parties brief[ed] and ar-
gue[d] the merits of the earlier judgment on appeal....");  
Martin, 199 F.3d at 1373 (FERC's responses "indicate that 
the agency was aware from the outset that [petitioner] meant 
to seek review of the Certificate Order.").  We therefore 
proceed to consider the substance of IPAA's contention that 
the District Court erred in dismissing its complaint for failing 
to challenge final agency action.

     IPAA argues that its claim originally included a challenge 
to the Samedan decision and that in IPAA I we reversed the 
District Court's order granting summary judgment against 
IPAA in its challenge to Samedan.  IPAA suggests the 
District Court ignored this mandate by refusing to enter a 

__________
     2 Originally, IPAA's current appeal was consolidated with Shell 
Offshore, Inc. v. Department of the Interior.  Shell and DOI filed a 
joint motion to stay all proceedings in the Shell cases.  On August 
8, 2000, this Court granted the motion.

judgment in its favor and subsequently dismissing its com-
plaint.  According to IPAA, by reopening questions already 
determined in earlier phases of this litigation, the District 
Court violated the mandate rule.  Further, IPAA contends 
that the Samedan decision constitutes a final agency action 
that provides the basis for a justiciable claim.  In response to 
IPAA's arguments, DOI submits that (1) IPAA's complaint 
did not challenge final agency action;  (2) IPAA does not have 
standing to challenge the Samedan decision;  and (3) IPAA's 
claim is not ripe for review.

     As we have explained before, "we have no difficulty dis-
missing a case based on one jurisdictional bar rather than 
another."  Louisiana Envtl. Action Network v. Browner, 87 
F.3d 1379, 1384 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  We therefore need not 
identify every ground for holding that a claim is not justicia-
ble.  See id. at 1385.  We conclude that the District Court 
properly dismissed IPAA's complaint because of the lack of 
final agency action.  Cf. Public Citizen v. Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representatives, 970 F.2d 916, 918 (D.C. Cir. 1992) 
(explaining that the absence of a final agency action "removes 
any need for considering the government's other jurisdiction-
al argument").

     Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
s 704, provides for judicial review of final agency action--that 
is, for a court to have jurisdiction over a case brought 
pursuant to s 704, the complaint must challenge a final action 
of an agency.  See Public Citizen, 970 F.2d at 918.  As we 
stated in DRG Funding Corp. v. Secretary of Housing & 
Urban Development, 76 F.3d 1212 (D.C. Cir. 1996), "[t]he 
requirement of a final agency action has been considered 
jurisdictional.  If the agency action is not final, the court 
therefore cannot reach the merits of the dispute."  Id. at 1214 
(citation omitted).  The APA defines agency action to include 
"the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, 
sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure 
to act."  5 U.S.C. s 551(13).  In determining whether such 
action is final, we consider "whether the agency's position is 
'definitive' and whether it has a 'direct and immediate ... 
effect on the day-to-day business' of the parties."  Ciba-Geigy 

Corp. v. United States Envtl. Protection Agency, 801 F.2d 
430, 436 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting Federal Trade Comm'n v. 
Standard Oil Corp. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 239 (1980) (internal 
quotes omitted));  see also Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 
(1997) (An agency action is final if it "mark[s] the consumma-
tion of the agency's decisionmaking process" and is "one by 
which rights or obligations have been determined, or from 
which legal consequences will flow." (citations and internal 
quotes omitted)).

     IPAA's complaint not only does not challenge final agency 
action, it is not at all clear what agency action IPAA purports 
to challenge.  The complaint states that IPAA challenges 
DOI's "efforts to collect" royalties on take-or-pay settlement 
payments.  What those "efforts" entail is less than clear.  
What is clear, however, is that these "efforts" are not final 
agency actions fit for judicial review.

     At best, IPAA's characterization of DOI's "efforts" seems 
analogous to the National Wildlife Federation's ("NWF") 
attempt to challenge the Bureau of Land Management's 
("BLM") "land withdrawal review program" in Lujan v. 
National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990).  NWF 
used the term "program" to describe BLM's activities in 
complying with the Federal Land Management Policy Act of 
1976, 43 U.S.C. s 1701 et seq.  The Lujan Court explained 
that "[t]he term 'land withdrawal review program' ... does 
not refer to a single BLM order or regulation, or even to a 
completed universe of particular BLM orders and regula-
tions."  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 890.  Accordingly, the Court 
concluded that the program was not "an identifiable action," 
id. at 899, and therefore held that NWF's claim could not be 
reviewed under the APA.  See id. 892-93.  Like the "pro-
gram" in Lujan, the "efforts" that IPAA seeks to challenge 
do not refer to any particular action taken by DOI, much less 
to any particular order, regulation, or completed universe of 
orders or regulations.  Cf. Sierra Club v. Peterson, 228 F.3d 
559, 566 (5th Cir. 2000) (en banc) ("This is not a justiciable 
challenge because the program of timber management to 
which the environmental groups object does not mark the 
consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process ... or 

constitute an identifiable action or event." (internal citations 
and quotations omitted));  Foundation on Econ. Trends v. 
Lyng, 943 F.2d 79, 86-87 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (holding that a 
plaintiff's complaint concerning the Department of Agricul-
ture's "germplasm preservation program" did not challenge 
agency action under the APA).  Instead, IPAA seeks to 
litigate the type of "generic challenge" the Lujan Court 
refused to hear.  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891 n.2.

     IPAA itself seemed to recognize this shortcoming when it 
entered an agreement with DOI to "simplify ... some of the 
procedural aspects of [ ] the IPAA Litigation."  Agreement, 
Independent Petroleum Ass'n of Am. v. Babbitt, No. 93-2544 
(D.D.C. Feb. 4, 1994).  That agreement recognized that MMS 
would issue up to 10 orders to companies to pay royalties 
based on their settlement agreements.  The companies could 
then appeal these orders to an Assistant Secretary of DOI 
who would issue decisions that could become "appropriate 
vehicles to seek judicial review"--that is, those orders would 
provide the foundation for justiciable test cases.  Id. at 5.  Of 
course, the order issued to Samedan provided the basis for 
one of those cases.  See Independent Petroleum Ass'n of 
Am., 971 F. Supp. at 24.

     Now IPAA claims that it is challenging DOI's Samedan 
decision.  That decision, however, is never mentioned in 
IPAA's complaint.  Indeed, DOI issued the Samedan decision 
over a year after IPAA filed its complaint in this case.  IPAA 
never amended its complaint to add a claim challenging that 
decision.  Nor did IPAA seek to intervene when Samedan 
appealed the Assistant Secretary's decision.  Although 
IPAA's case was later consolidated with Samedan's case, the 
two cases continued to be separate.  See Cella v. Togum 
Constructeur Ensemleier en Industrie Alimentaire, 173 F.3d 
909, 912 (3d Cir. 1999) (noting consolidation does not merge 
suits into a single case).  Simply because IPAA and Samedan 
were represented by the same counsel and filed a joint brief 
on appeal, their individual cases were not somehow merged 
into one--they remained separate and distinct.

     Alternatively, IPAA avers that in IPAA I the parties 
litigated the Samedan decision by implied consent through 
their cross-motions for summary judgment.  See Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 15(b).  According to Rule 15(b), "[w]hen issues not raised 
by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of 
the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had 
been raised in the pleadings."  Id.  The Rule's implied con-
sent provision is normally invoked when evidence concerning 
an issue not addressed in the pleadings is introduced at trial 
without objection.  See 6A Charles Alan Wright et al., 
Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil 2d s 1493 (2d ed. 
1990).  In such cases, we uphold a trial court's determination 
of whether parties impliedly consented to try an issue unless 
the court abused its discretion.  See Kirkland v. District of 
Columbia, 70 F.3d 629, 633 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

     It is an open question whether the Federal Rules permit 
parties to impliedly consent to "try" issues not raised in their 
pleadings through summary judgment motions.  In Harris v. 
Secretary, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 126 F.3d 339 
(D.C. Cir. 1997), we wrote that "[b]ecause a case decided on 
motion for summary judgment does not reach trial, ... Rule 
15(b) does not apply."  Id. at 344 n.3.  Yet, in Kulkarni v. 
Alexander, 662 F.2d 758 (D.C. Cir. 1978), we noted that Rule 
15(b)'s "general principle has been applied to motions for 
summary judgment."  Id. at 762.  We need not decide that 
general question.  In this case there is no clear evidence in 
the record that DOI consented to allow IPAA to challenge the 
Samedan decision--certainly no proof sufficient to reverse 
the District Court's ruling that IPAA did not challenge the 
Samedan decision.  See Independent Petroleum Ass'n of 
Am., 971 F. Supp. at 25-26.  In fact, this case's history is 
sprinkled with references made by IPAA that its case is 
distinct from Samedan's.  For example, in the proceedings 
leading up to this Court's decision in IPAA I, IPAA distin-
guished between "the Association's generic challenge to 
[DOI's] interpretation and enforcement of their royalty value 
regulations" and "Samedan's challenge to a particular order 
to pay additional royalties owed under the terms of its lease."  
Joint Motion for Enlargement of Page Limitations at 2, IPAA 

I, 92 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (No. 95-5210) (emphasis 
added).  Likewise in its IPAA I brief, IPAA specifically 
described two suits:  IPAA's challenge to the May 1993 letter 
and "[t]he second suit ... brought by Samedan Oil Corpora-
tion ... challeng[ing] a 1994 decision of Interior Department 
Assistant Secretary Deer."  Appellants' Brief at 4, IPAA I, 
92 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Nos. 95-5210 & 95-5245).  DOI 
also recognized that the two cases were distinct in IPAA I, as 
its brief provided separate procedural backgrounds for 
IPAA's suit "challenging the propriety of the MMS Associate 
Director's May 1993 letter" and Samedan's effort to seek 
"judicial review of the Assistant Secretary's [Samedan] deci-
sion."  Appellee's Brief at 11, 16, IPAA I, 92 F.3d 1248 (D.C. 
Cir. 1996) (Nos. 95-5210 & 95-5245).  Given this history, we 
cannot possibly find that the parties impliedly consented to 
litigate the Samedan decision.

     IPAA argues that the mandate rule precludes the District 
Court--and now this Court--from holding that it never chal-
lenged the Samedan decision.  Specifically, IPAA points to 
language in our IPAA I decision suggesting that it had 
challenged the Agency's decision.  Under the mandate rule, 
"an inferior court has no power or authority to deviate from 
the mandate issued by an appellate court."  Briggs v. Penn-
sylvania R.R. Co., 334 U.S. 304, 306 (1948).  The mandate 
rule is a "more powerful version" of the law-of-the-case 
doctrine, which prevents courts from reconsidering issues 
that have already been decided in the same case.  LaShawn 
A. v. Barry ("LaShawn II"), 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 & n.3 (D.C. 
Cir. 1996) (en banc);  see also Kimberlin v. Quinlan, 199 F.3d 
496, 500 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (describing the law-of-the-case doc-
trine).  As this Court explained in LaShawn II, this doctrine 
applies to jurisdictional issues, whether those issues were 
decided " 'explicitly or by necessary implication.' "  LaShawn 
II, 87 F.3d at 1394 (quoting Crocker v. Piedmont Aviation, 
Inc., 49 F.3d 735, 739 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  Nevertheless, courts 
are "not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case 
where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio."  
United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 
38 (1952);  see also LaShawn II, 87 F.3d at 1395 n.6 (explain-

ing that courts are not "bound by decisions on questions of 
jurisdiction made sub silentio in previous cases 'when a 
subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue' to the 
Court" (quoting Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halder-
man, 465 U.S. 89, 119 (1984))).

     Although some portions of the IPAA I decision may be 
read to suggest that IPAA challenged the Samedan decision, 
the question of whether IPAA had challenged that decision 
was not before us, nor decided by us, even by implication.  
Any confusion read into our earlier opinion stems from the 
fact that this issue was not cleanly raised.  Now that we are 
able to consider IPAA's claim standing alone, we are able to 
make a precise determination concerning its content and its 
justiciability.  Indeed, as explained above, its content is clear, 
and it is not justiciable.  Consequently, the District Court 
stood on firm ground in considering whether IPAA had 
challenged final agency action and holding that it did not.  
Like the District Court, we do no harm to the law of this 
Circuit nor the law of this case by considering this issue 
today, with the question placed squarely before us unclut-
tered by other claims or cases.

     In a footnote buried on the nineteenth page of its reply 
brief, IPAA makes one last effort to litigate its claim, request-
ing leave to amend its complaint to include a challenge to the 
Samedan decision.  See 28 U.S.C. s 1653.  We deny this 
request.  IPAA points out that this Court granted leave to 
amend following a motion made at oral argument in DKT 
Memorial Fund, Ltd. v. Agency for International Develop-
ment, 810 F.2d 1236, 1239 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  The unique 
circumstances of DKT belie its applicability in other cases.  
DKT's singular holding was limited to the facts of a discrete 
case dealing with international affairs.  See id. at 1238-39.  
In that case, leave to amend was constrained to a single 
factual allegation--a factual allegation that the plaintiffs inad-
vertently omitted--that clarified the plaintiffs' standing in an 
area where "current precedent does not conclusively indicate 
whether" such a party has standing.  Id. at 1239.  The DKT 
Court made plain that the appellants' omission had been 

inadvertent and that, based on the facts of the case, granting 
leave to amend was in the public interest.  See id.

     While it is possible that, like the appellants in DKT, IPAA's 
failure to amend its pleading at an earlier stage in this 
litigation may have been "more inadvertent than deliberate," 
id. at 1239, unlike in DKT, IPAA fails to articulate what 
"interest of justice" would be served by allowing it to amend 
its complaint now, roughly seven years after it filed the 
original complaint and six years after DOI issued the Same-
dan decision.  Additionally, in contrast to the DKT appel-
lants, who merely sought to amend their claim to add a single 
factual allegation, IPAA seeks to add an entirely new claim.  
However, as we have said before, new claims "cannot set sail, 
initially, on appeal if courts are to operate with reasonable 
speed and efficiency."  Shipbuilders Council of Am. v. Unit-
ed States, 868 F.2d 452, 456 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

     Finally, we question whether IPAA's amendment would 
"convert their action into a justiciable case."  Id.  Instead, 
permitting IPAA to amend its claim likely would lead this 
Court into a jurisdictional morass.  See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. 
Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-54 (1967);  Student Loan Mktg. 
Ass'n v. Riley, 104 F.3d 397, 406-07 (D.C. Cir. 1997);  Shell 
Oil Co. v. FERC, 47 F.3d 1186, 1201-02 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  
Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 983 F.2d 275, 284 (D.C. Cir. 
1993);  Shipbuilders Council, 868 F.2d at 456;  Radiofone, 
Inc. v. FCC, 759 F.2d 936, 939 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J., 
opinion).  Accordingly, we are compelled to deny IPAA's 
request.

                         III. CONCLUSION

     For the reasons stated above, the District Court's judg-
ment is
