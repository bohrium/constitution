     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Global Crossing Telecommunica-
tions, Inc. petitions for review of an order of the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC), requiring Global Cross-
ing to pay Verizon Telephone Companies compensation for 
payphone calls originating from Verizon payphones and rout-
ed over Global Crossing's network.1  Finding the FCC's 
decision consistent with the statutory scheme and neither 
arbitrary nor capricious, we deny the petition for review.

                                I

     In s 276 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,2 Congress 
directed the FCC to:

     prescribe regulations that--
     
          (A) establish a per call compensation plan to ensure 
          that all payphone service providers are fairly compen-
          sated for each and every completed intrastate and 
          interstate call using their payphone ...;  [and]
          
__________
     1 At the time of the proceedings below, Global Crossing was 
known as Frontier Communications Services, Inc., and Verizon was 
known as Bell Atlantic.

     2 Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (1996) (codified in scattered 
sections of 47 U.S.C.).

          (B) discontinue ... all intrastate and interstate pay-
          phone subsidies from basic exchange and exchange 
          access revenues, in favor of a compensation plan as 
          specified in subparagraph (A).
          
47 U.S.C. s 276(b)(1)(A), (B).3  Pursuant to Congress' di-
rection, the FCC issued orders in 1996 that implemented the 
provisions of s 276, including paragraphs (A) and (B).  See 
Report and Order, Implementation of the Pay Telephone 
Reclassification and Compensation Provisions of the Tele-
communications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd 20,541 (1996);  
Order on Reconsideration, 11 FCC Rcd 21,233 (1996), aff'd in 
part and remanded in part sub nom. Illinois Pub. Telecomm. 
Ass'n, 117 F.3d 555 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (collectively, Payphone 
Orders).

     With respect to paragraph (A), the FCC required interex-
change carriers (IXCs) that carry calls originating from pay-
phones to compensate the payphone service provider (PSP).4  
See 47 C.F.R. s 64.1300(a) ("[E]very carrier to whom a 
completed call from a payphone is routed shall compensate 
the payphone service provider for the call at a rate agreed 
upon by the parties by contract.");  Report and Order, Pay-
phone Orders, 11 FCC Rcd at 20,566, p 48;  id. at 20,584, p 83.  
Previously, PSPs had received no revenue for originating 
certain calls (such as subscriber 800 and other toll-free num-
ber calls) and were prohibited from blocking callers from 
making some of those calls (such as access code calls).  See 
Bell Atlantic-Delaware v. Frontier Communications Servs., 
Inc., 14 FCC Rcd 16,050, 16,053-54, p 5 (Com. Car. Bur. 1999)

Pub. Telecomm. Ass'n v. FCC, 117 F.3d 555, 558-61 (D.C. Cir. 
1997).

     4 "Long-distance telephone traffic is ordinarily transmitted by a 
local exchange carrier ('LEC') from its origin to a long-distance 
carrier (or interexchange carrier or 'IXC').  The IXC carries the 
traffic to its region of destination and hands it off to the LEC 
there."  U.S. Tel. Ass'n v. FCC, 188 F.3d 521, 523-24 (D.C. Cir. 
1999).

(hereinafter "Bureau Order").  The Commission concluded 
that PSPs must be compensated for all such calls, and 
determined that IXCs, as the primary beneficiaries of those 
calls, should be responsible for providing that compensation.  
See id. at 16,054, p 5;  Report and Order, Payphone Orders, 
11 FCC Rcd at 20,584, p 83.

     To implement paragraph (B), the FCC ruled that in order 
to receive compensation for completed calls originating from 
its payphones, a PSP that is also a local exchange carrier 
(LEC PSP), see supra note 4, "must be able to certify" that it 
has complied with several requirements, including the institu-
tion of "effective intrastate tariffs reflecting the removal of 
charges that recover the costs of payphones and any intra-
state [payphone] subsidies."  Order on Reconsideration, Pay-
phone Orders, 11 FCC Rcd at 21,293, p 131.  The FCC 
delegated to its Common Carrier Bureau the authority to 
make "any necessary determination as to whether a LEC has 
complied with all requirements" for compensation.  Id. at 
21,294, p 132.

     Verizon is a LEC PSP that offers local exchange and 
payphone services in the northeast and mid-Atlantic states.  
Global Crossing is an IXC that provides both interstate and 
intrastate telephone toll service.  Since October 1997, when 
the per call compensation requirement became effective, Veri-
zon has delivered calls from its payphones to Global Crossing.

     In June 1997, in order to obtain compensation for calls 
originating from Verizon's payphones and carried by Global 
Crossing, Verizon presented Global Crossing with signed 
letters attesting that it had complied with all of the conditions 
for receiving compensation, including the elimination of intra-
state subsidies.  Global Crossing replied that it would not pay 
compensation until Verizon provided additional information, 
specified by Global Crossing, establishing that Verizon had in 
fact satisfied the compensation eligibility prerequisites--par-
ticularly the removal of those subsidies.  In June 1998, 
representatives of Verizon and Global Crossing met with staff 
of the Common Carrier Bureau, who advised that under the 
FCC's rules and orders, "IXCs must compensate a LEC 

payphone service provider upon receipt of the LEC's certifi-
cation of eligibility without further inquiry or requirements."  
Bureau Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 16,058, p 10.  Nonetheless, 
Global Crossing continued to refuse to pay, and, on July 15, 
1998, Verizon filed a formal complaint with the FCC pursuant 
to 47 U.S.C. s 208.5  The complaint alleged that Global 
Crossing had violated 47 U.S.C. s 276, as well as 47 C.F.R. 
s 64.1300, by failing to compensate Verizon for more than 
11,200,000 calls.  Complaint pp 33-35.

     In September 1999, the Common Carrier Bureau held that 
Verizon had adequately certified its compliance with the 
prerequisites for receiving compensation and ordered Global 
Crossing to pay Verizon for applicable past and future calls.  
Bureau Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 16,052, p 3.  The Bureau 
determined that "[t]he term 'certification' ... does not man-
date that a LEC payphone service provider prove to the IXC 
payor that it has satisfied each compensation eligibility pre-
requisite," but rather requires that a LEC "attest[ ] authori-
tatively to an IXC payor that such LEC payphone service 
provider has satisfied each prerequisite."  Id. (emphasis add-
ed).  The Bureau found that interpretation to be consistent 
with prior Commission orders, and permissible under the 
language of s 276.  Id. at 16,063-65, pp 18-19, 22.  And it 
held that if Global Crossing (or any other IXC) wished to 
question "the veracity of a LEC's certification," it was obliged 
to do so by filing its own complaint with the Commission, 

__________
     5 Section 208, entitled "Complaints to Commission," states:

     a) Any person ... complaining of anything done or omitted to 
     be done by any common carrier subject to this chapter, in 
     contravention of the provisions thereof, may apply to said 
     Commission by petition....  If such carrier ... shall not 
     satisfy the complaint within the time specified or there shall 
     appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating said 
     complaint, it shall be the duty of the Commission to investigate 
     the matters complained of in such manner and by such means 
     as it shall deem proper.
     
47 U.S.C. s 208.

rather than by simply refusing to make payment.  Id. at 
16,068, p 27.

     The FCC affirmed the Bureau's decision in all respects.  
Order on Review, Bell Atlantic-Delaware v. Frontier Com-
munications Servs., Inc., 15 FCC Rcd 7475, 7480, p 11 (2000) 
(hereinafter "FCC Order").  The Commission also refused to 
consider Global Crossing's "affirmative defense" that Verizon 
"in fact, had not qualified for payphone compensation."  Id. at 
7479, p 9.  The Commission held that this "so-called 'affirma-
tive defense' " was "irrelevant to evaluating [Global Cross-
ing's] obligation to pay upon receiving certification," and "was 
not properly before the Bureau in the context of" a complaint 
filed by a LEC PSP.  Id.  "[T]he proper way for an IXC to 
challenge a LEC's failure to remove unlawful subsidies," the 
FCC declared, "is to initiate a Section 208 proceeding at the 
Commission."  Id. at 7479-80, p 9.

                                II

     Global Crossing contends that the FCC's determination, 
that an IXC must pay a LEC PSP compensation merely upon 
certification that the LEC has discontinued subsidizing its 
payphone service, is neither consistent with s 276 of the 
Telecommunications Act nor the product of reasoned deci-
sionmaking.  We consider these two arguments below.

                                A

     In addressing Global Crossing's statutory argument, we 
apply the two-step framework of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. 
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 
(1984).6  We first ask "whether Congress has directly spoken 
to the precise question at issue," in which case we "must give 
effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."  

__________
     6 In United States v. Mead Corp., the Supreme Court confirmed 
the applicability of the Chevron test to a case like this one, where 
"Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make 
rules carrying the force of law, and ... the agency interpretation 
claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authori-
ty."  121 S.Ct. 2164, 2171 (2001).

Id. at 842-43.  If, however, the "statute is silent or ambigu-
ous with respect to the specific issue," we move to the second 
step and defer to the agency's interpretation as long as it is 
"based on a permissible construction of the statute," id. at 
843, and is "reasonable in light of the Act's text, legislative 
history, and purpose," Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. FERC, 
116 F.3d 507, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1997).

     Global Crossing asserts that permitting Verizon to receive 
compensation merely upon its certification that it has discon-
tinued subsidies is inconsistent with the express language of 
s 276, which requires the Commission to promulgate regula-
tions that "discontinue ... all intrastate and interstate pay-
phone subsidies ... in favor of a compensation plan."  47 
U.S.C. s 276(b)(1)(B).  That language, Global Crossing ar-
gues, "ties the timing of the receipt of compensation to the 
removal of the subsidies," rendering Verizon unqualified to 
receive compensation until it first removes all of its subsidies.  
Reply Br. at 10.  By allowing Verizon to rely on certification 
alone, petitioner continues, the FCC permitted the LEC PSP 
to receive per call compensation without regard to whether it 
had in fact discontinued its payphone subsidies.

     The FCC does not disagree that s 276 requires Verizon to 
discontinue subsidies before it may receive compensation.  
Indeed, the Bureau's decision "emphasize[s] that a LEC's 
certification letter does not substitute for the LEC's obli-
gation to comply" with the requirements for compensation, 
and that "LECs must satisfy the requirements ... to be 
eligible to receive compensation."  Bureau Order, 14 FCC 
Rcd at 16,068, p 28.  The Commission rightly notes, however, 
that the statute is silent regarding the mechanism the FCC 
should adopt to ensure that the statute's requirements are 
carried out.  See id. at 16,065, p 22.  That being so, the only 
question for us is whether, under Chevron step two, the 
FCC's interpretation "is based on a reasonable construction 
of the statutory term[s]."  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 840.  And we 
see nothing unreasonable about the FCC's conclusion that the 
statute permits it to adopt a certification regime.

     Global Crossing contends that by relying upon certifica-
tion--upon nothing more than the word of the LEC PSP--
the FCC cannot ensure that subsidies have been discontinued 
"in favor of" compensation, and hence cannot ensure compli-
ance with that statutory requirement.  But the FCC does not 
rely solely upon certification;  certification is merely the initial 
step in the Commission's enforcement scheme.  If an IXC 
believes that a LEC PSP's certification is false or otherwise 
unsupported, the IXC may file a complaint under s 208 of the 
Communications Act and, if correct, will recover damages, 
including its payments and interest thereon.  See 47 U.S.C. 
ss 206-09.  Moreover, if a LEC PSP is found to have certi-
fied falsely, it faces additional penalties, including fines and 
forfeitures, in an enforcement action brought by the Commis-
sion.  See 47 U.S.C. ss 501-04.  Taken together, these proce-
dural mechanisms appear reasonably calculated to accomplish 
the congressional purpose.

     Although the enforcement regime chosen by the Commis-
sion may not be the only one possible, we must uphold it as 
long as it is a reasonable means of implementing the statuto-
ry requirements.  See New England Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 
826 F.2d 1101, 1107-08 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Certification is the 
mechanism the FCC employs for a broad range of its other 
statutory functions.7  There is nothing about the language or 
purpose of s 276 to indicate that certification is an inappro-

     7 See, e.g., Cellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, 205 F.3d 82, 92-93 
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (rejecting a challenge to the FCC's decision to 
allow undocumented self-certification of compliance with environ-
mental guidelines by FCC license applicants);  CHM Broad. Ltd. 
P'ship v. FCC, 24 F.3d 1453, 1455-56 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (noting that 
the FCC uses self-certification to implement the statutory require-
ment that applicants for radio station licenses demonstrate their 
financial qualifications);  Supplemental Order Clarification, Imple-
mentation of the Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommu-
nications Act of 1996, 15 FCC Rcd 9587, 9602-03, p 29 (2000) 
(clarifying that "incumbent LECs must allow requesting carriers to 
self-certify" that they meet certain requirements, and noting that "a 
letter sent to the incumbent LEC by a requesting carrier is a 
practical method of certification").

priate method of fulfilling the payphone requirements of the 
Telecommunications Act as well.

                                B

     In addition to its statutory argument, Global Crossing 
advances two further arguments that are best characterized 
as claims that the FCC's certification policy does not repre-
sent reasoned decisionmaking.  As to these claims, we apply 
the deferential standard of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA), and will uphold the Commission's policy judgments as 
long as they are not "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of 
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."  5 
U.S.C. s 706(2)(A).  To satisfy that standard, an agency must 
"examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory expla-
nation for its action including a 'rational connection between 
the facts found and the choice made.' "  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. 
Ass'n of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. 
Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, 
Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).

     In an argument that largely overlaps with its claims under 
Chevron step two, Global Crossing asserts that the FCC 
failed to articulate any reasoned basis for relying on a policy 
of certification.  We are not persuaded.  As discussed in Part 
II.A, the Commission reasonably concluded that certification 
of compliance, coupled with provisions for complaint and 
enforcement proceedings, will accomplish the statutory pur-
pose of discontinuing payphone subsidies.  At the same time, 
the FCC reasonably determined that requiring IXCs to pay 
immediately upon certification for calls routed over their 
networks will promote certainty in the achievement of Con-
gress' other purpose:  " 'ensur[ing] that all payphone service 
providers are fairly compensated for each and every ... 
call.' "  Bureau Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 16,064, p 20 (quoting 47 
U.S.C. s 276(b)(1)(A)).  Global Crossing may be correct in 
arguing that certainty of compensation can also be ensured 
by permitting an IXC to decide whether a LEC PSP's proof 
of compliance is sufficient, and then requiring the LEC to file 
a complaint with the Commission if it is dissatisfied.  But 

Congress has delegated the authority to make the choice 
between such alternatives to the FCC, and our only responsi-
bility is to ensure that the choice the FCC has made is a 
reasonable one.

     Global Crossing also contends that, in requiring payment 
upon mere certification, the FCC departed from its prior 
orders and precedents without explanation.  It is true that 
"an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule" or 
departing from precedent "is obligated to supply a reasoned 
analysis for the change."  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42;  see 
Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 852 
(D.C. Cir. 1970).  But it is also true that we must defer to an 
agency's reading of its own regulations unless that reading is 
"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]," 
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997), and that we must 
accord deference to an agency's reasonable interpretation of 
its own precedents, see Cassell v. FCC, 154 F.3d 478, 483 
(D.C. Cir. 1998).  We perceive no unexplained departure from 
the agency's prior policies here.

     To implement s 276(b)(1)(B), the FCC issued an order 
providing that a LEC PSP "must be able to certify" that it 
has, inter alia, removed intrastate subsidies before it may 
receive compensation for calls originating from its payphones.  
Order on Reconsideration, Payphone Orders, 11 FCC Rcd at 
21,293, p 131.  The Commission's order did not specify the 
requirements for such certification, but instead delegated to 
the Common Carrier Bureau the authority to make "any 
necessary determination as to whether a LEC has complied 
with all requirements" for compensation.  Id. at 21,294, p 132.  
Global Crossing maintains that "to certify" means more than 
merely to attest to compliance;  rather, it requires the LEC 
PSP to provide the IXC with full proof that it has satisfied all 
regulatory conditions.  The Bureau, however, interpreted the 
phrase as requiring only attestation, and the FCC confirmed 
that as the correct construction of the Commission's own 
language.  FCC Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7479, p 7.

     The Bureau's interpretation of the Commission's order is a 
reasonable one.  The Bureau relied upon "the ordinary mean-
ing of the term 'to certify,' " defined by Black's Law Dictio-
nary as "the formal assertion in writing of some fact," and by 
Webster's as "to attest as being true."  Bureau Order, 14 
FCC Rcd at 16,062, p 16 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 227 
(6th ed. 1990);  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 
223 (1989)).  It also noted that the Commission has used this 
meaning of "certify" in other contexts.  Id. at 16,062-63, p  17 
(citing 47 C.F.R. s 1.734(c) (providing that the signature of a 
party on a pleading "shall be a certificate that ... to the best 
of his or her knowledge [the pleading] is well grounded in 
fact"));  see also CHM Broad. Ltd. P'ship v. FCC, 24 F.3d 
1453, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (noting that an applicant for an 
FM radio license "certifies" that it has sufficient assets to 
construct and operate a station by checking "yes" on an FCC 
form).

     The Bureau further observed, correctly, that this interpre-
tation of "to certify" is consistent with decisions issued by the 
FCC and the Bureau since the promulgation of the initial 
1996 Payphone Orders.  The Bureau pointed out, for exam-
ple, that the Commission had ruled that LEC PSPs are not 
required to file a certification with any state or federal 
regulatory agency, or to obtain a formal certification of 
compliance from either the states or the FCC, in order to be 
eligible to receive compensation.  Bureau Order, 14 FCC Rcd 
at 16,054-55, p 6 (citing Second Report and Order, 13 FCC 
Rcd at 1780, p 1 n.9).  The Bureau also noted that, in its 
Intrastate Tariffing Waiver Order, it specifically refused 
AT&T's request to declare that "a LEC is not eligible for 
payphone compensation 'until it has provided proof of state 
action verifying the LEC's compliance with section 276.' "  Id. 
at 16,063, p 18 (quoting 12 FCC Rcd at 21,377, p 16).  Instead, 
the Bureau "reiterated that the Commission's previous orders 
required only that a LEC 'be able to certify' compliance with 
the payphone compensation prerequisites."  Id. (quoting 12 
FCC Rcd at 21,380, p 22).  And in two further orders, the 
Bureau declared that "LECs that have certified to the IXC 
that they comply with the requirements of the Payphone 
Orders must receive per-call compensation."  Implementa-

tion of the Pay Telephone Reclassification and Compensa-
tion Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 13 
FCC Rcd 4998, 5002, p 4 (Com. Car. Bur. 1998) (emphasis 
added);  see also Implementation of the Pay Telephone Re-
classification and Compensation Provisions of the Telecom-
munications Act of 1996, 13 FCC Rcd 10,893, 10,899, p 12 
(Com. Car. Bur. 1998).

     In sum, the agency order at issue in this case reflects 
neither a failure to articulate a reasonable basis for decision, 
nor a departure from FCC policy and precedent.  We there-
fore find it to be consistent with the APA's standards for 
reasoned decisionmaking.

                               III

     Global Crossing also challenges the Commission's determi-
nation that an IXC seeking to contest the veracity of a LEC 
PSP's certification must file its own complaint for damages 
under 47 U.S.C. s 208, and may not assert lack of compliance 
as an "affirmative defense" to a complaint brought by a LEC 
PSP.  Petitioner contends that by directing it to pay Verizon 
without considering its defense of noncompliance, the Com-
mission abdicated its "duty to adjudicate issues raised in 
complaint proceedings."  Global Crossing Br. at 12.  Citing 
our opinion in American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. FCC, 
978 F.2d 727 (D.C. Cir. 1992), Global Crossing argues that by 
refusing to address its affirmative defense, the FCC breached 
its duty to consider Global Crossing's claim on the merits.

     We do not agree.  First, as the FCC points out, there was 
no failure to consider an "affirmative defense" here because 
the FCC has not designated noncompliance as an affirmative 
defense;  rather, it is part of the case-in-chief that an IXC 
must initiate on its own.  Second, this approach is not con-
trary to our ruling in American Telephone.  In that case, the 
Commission relied on the validity of an earlier FCC order in 
dismissing a complaint brought by AT&T against a competi-
tor--without adjudicating AT&T's claim that the order was 
unlawful.  The Commission said that it would instead consid-
er the validity of the order in a new rulemaking.  We held 

that the Commission could not postpone a question concern-
ing the application of existing law by declaring its intent to 
consider a future change in that law.  The Commission, we 
said, appeared to be trying to "avoid judicial review" of its 
order by engaging in "a sort of administrative law shell 
game."  American Tel. & Tel., 978 F.2d at 731-32;  see id. at 
729, 731-32.

     Here, however, there is no shell game, because the FCC 
has made quite clear under which shell the pea lies.  The 
Commission has advised Global Crossing several times that if 
it wishes to contest Verizon's qualifications for payphone 
compensation, it should bring a separate action under s 208.  
And the Commission has also made clear that if Global 
Crossing brings such an action, it will decide the matter in 
that forum.  Although the Commission does have an obli-
gation to adjudicate claims raised by a party filing a com-
plaint, see American Tel. & Tel., 978 F.2d at 732, it will fulfill 
that obligation by considering Global Crossing's allegations 
when they are properly filed.8

     Nor has Global Crossing been able to articulate how it is 
disadvantaged by the Commission's requirement that it be a 
complainant rather than a respondent.  As petitioner con-
ceded at oral argument, there is no difference in the alloca-
tion of the burden of proof:  Although the party that brings a 
s 208 complaint bears the burden, see Hi-Tech Furnace Sys., 
Inc. v. FCC, 224 F.3d 781, 787 (D.C. Cir. 2000), so does a 
party that asserts an affirmative defense to such a complaint, 
see AT&T v. Business Telecom, Inc., FCC 01-185, 2001 WL 
575527, at p 46 (rel. May 30, 2001).  At oral argument, Global 
Crossing also denied that it would derive any economic 
benefit from being a respondent rather than a complainant:  
It noted that because it would recover its payments with 
interest if it prevailed on a s 208 complaint, there was no 
difference between asserting noncompliance as an affirmative

     8 See AT&T v. FCC, 220 F.3d 607, 631 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding 
that the FCC may, consistent with American Telephone, bar collat-
eral challenges to other FCC orders in proceedings brought to 
adjudicate applications to provide in-region long distance service).

defense to nonpayment, and paying upon demand and then 
filing a complaint to recover.  Indeed, Global Crossing even 
denied that cash-flow considerations made the position of 
respondent preferable.  But if Global Crossing truly has 
nothing to gain from the alternative for which it presses, and 
hence suffers no disadvantage from the procedural posture to 
which the FCC has assigned it, then it would appear to have 
little basis for complaining about the FCC's decision.

     It is well-settled that the Commission "enjoys wide discre-
tion in fashioning its own procedures."  City of Angels 
Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 745 F.2d 656, 664 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  
Section 208 authorizes the FCC to investigate a complaint "in 
such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper."  47 
U.S.C. s 208.  More generally, 47 U.S.C. s 154(j) provides 
that "[t]he Commission may conduct its proceedings in such 
manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of busi-
ness and to the ends of justice."  Although Global Crossing 
contends that designation of an issue as part of an affirmative 
case rather than as an affirmative defense is a matter of 
substance, not procedure, we disagree.  The Supreme Court 
has interpreted s 154(j) "as explicitly and by implication 
delegating to the Commission power to resolve subordinate 
questions of procedure such as the scope of the inquiry, 
whether applications should be heard contemporaneously or 
successively, whether parties should be allowed to intervene 
in one another's proceedings, and similar questions."  FCC v. 
Schreiber, 381 U.S. 279, 289 (1965) (internal quotations omit-
ted).  The question of whether an issue is properly designat-
ed as an affirmative defense falls well within that rubric.  Cf. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (designating certain issues as "affirmative 
defenses" rather than "counterclaims");  AT&T, 220 F.3d 607, 
630 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (according deference, in a proceeding 
under 47 U.S.C. s 271, to the FCC's decision to bar a 
collateral challenge to a prior FCC order and instead to 
require the filing of a separate petition for review).  And 
because there is nothing arbitrary about the FCC's decision 
to require Global Crossing to raise its claim of noncompliance 
by separate complaint, the Commission's decision "may not be 

impeached merely because reasonable minds might differ on 
the wisdom thereof."  Id. at 292.

     For the foregoing reasons, Global Crossing's petition for 
review is denied and the FCC's order on review is
