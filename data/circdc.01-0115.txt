Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Appellant Cyn-
thia Miranda Morrison appeals the district court's denial of 
her motion for partial summary judgment and its grant of the 
appellees' motion for judgment as a matter of law.  She also 
challenges the court's evidentiary ruling excluding documen-
tation of an IRS assessment and levy.  For the reasons that 
follow, we affirm the district court's denial of summary judg-
ment and its evidentiary ruling but reverse the court's grant 
of judgment as a matter of law.

                          I. Background

     In June 1994 appellee Katie Hanlon, president of appellee 
International Programs Consortium, Inc. (IPC), hired Morri-
son as a consultant to perform recruiting and management 
tasks pursuant to a series of written contracts.  After the 
contracts expired in late 1994 Morrison continued to perform 
consulting work for IPC and also began to perform various 
office tasks and was required to prepare daily activity sheets 
for Hanlon.  Morrison, however, continued to consider herself 
an independent contractor and submitted invoices to IPC on 
"C. Miranda Morrison Consulting" letterhead.

     On July 5, 1995 Morrison wrote Hanlon to notify her that 
as of August 1, 1995 she "will no longer be offering [her] 
services as a consultant to IPC."  Letter from C. Miranda 
Morrison to Kathleen M. Hanlon (July 5, 1995), reprinted at 
JA 319.  She continued to work for IPC during July, concen-
trating primarily on a U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) delivery order (the Moldova project).  On July 
28, 1995 Hanlon terminated Morrison for failing to take 
direction as well as for taking days off from work without 
permission.  Morrison subsequently submitted her July 1995 
time and expense statements which reflected $4061.64 for 
hours worked (22 days at $184.62 per day) and $228.26 for 
expenses she paid on behalf of IPC.  Neither Hanlon nor IPC 
paid Morrison for her time or expenses.

     On January 8, 1996 Morrison filed with the IRS District 
Director a request for "Determination of Employee Work 
Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and In-

come Tax Withholding" on IRS Form SS-8.  IPC responded 
to the IRS's subsequent request for further information 
through its certified public accountant, explaining why it 
believed Morrison to be an independent contractor while she 
worked for IPC.  The IRS District Director then determined 
that under 26 U.S.C. s 3121(d)(2) Morrison was an employee 
rather than an independent contractor.  The determination 
noted, however, that "[a]s we are not in a position to person-
ally judge the validity of the facts provided, our determination 
is based on the information presented."  Letter from Michael 
M. Greenspan, IRS District Director, to Kathleen M. Hanlon 
(July 1, 1996), reprinted at JA 356.  It explained that "[w]e 
have submitted an Information Report to the IRS District 
Office having examination jurisdiction for your area.  It may 
be necessary to initiate an examination of your Federal 
employment taxes in this matter."  Id.  The IRS ultimately 
assessed taxes and penalties totaling $3530.64 against IPC on 
the ground that Morrison had been an IPC employee during 
the entire time she worked for IPC in 1995.  The IRS 
subsequently levied on IPC's bank account to satisfy the 
assessment.  Neither Hanlon nor IPC appealed the IRS 
assessment or levy.

     On August 14, 1997 Morrison brought suit in the district 
court against the appellees,1 alleging that she had been an 
IPC employee in 1995 and that the appellees had violated (a) 
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. s 216, by 
failing to pay her minimum wages and overtime for weeks in 
which she worked more than 40 hours in July 1995 (Count I), 
(b) the D.C. Payment and Collection of Wages Law, D.C. 
Code ss 36-101 et seq., by failing to pay her for July wages 
and expenses advanced on behalf of IPC (Count II), (c) the 
D.C. Minimum Wage Act, D.C. Code ss 36-220 et seq., by 
failing to pay her minimum wages and overtime (Count III) 
and (d) its contractual obligation to reimburse her for $228.26 

__________
     1 Morrison sued Hanlon as well as IPC because IPC's corporate 
charter had been revoked by the District of Columbia for nonpay-
ment of the annual fee.  The charter was not restored by the time 
of trial.

in expenses that she incurred on behalf of IPC (Count IV).  
Before trial Morrison sought partial summary judgment on 
counts I, II and III, maintaining that the IRS determination 
had preclusive effect on the question of her status as an 
employee under the FLSA and D.C. labor laws.  At the time 
she moved for summary judgment, she relied solely on the 
IRS determination letter;  she did not submit documents 
relating to the assessment and levy because the appellees had 
failed to produce them.  The trial court denied the motion for 
partial summary judgment because (1) Morrison failed to 
produce evidence that the IRS ever investigated the matter 
beyond its initial determination or that IPC paid any assessed 
taxes and penalties;  (2) the IRS did not act in a judicial 
capacity when it issued the determination letter;  and (3) 
according to the definition of "employee" under IRS regula-
tions Morrison was not entitled to any "employee" rights 
under the FLSA, the D.C. Wages Law or the D.C. Minimum 
Wage Act.  See Morrison v. International Programs Consortium, 
Inc., No. 97-1837, slip op. at 5-8 (D.D.C. filed Feb. 4, 2000).  
Morrison appeals this ruling.

     The case was then tried before a jury.  At trial the 
magistrate judge refused to admit documents detailing the 
IRS assessment and levy because "the court finds that they 
are not relevant to any issue which would be before the jury." 
JA 267.  This is the second ruling Morrison appeals.  At the 
conclusion of Morrison's case the judge provided Hanlon, who 
was representing herself, a copy of Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 and 
granted Hanlon's subsequent motion for judgment as a mat-
ter of law on all four counts, concluding that Morrison 
presented no evidence to support her contention that she was 
an employee of IPC.  JA 299-303.  This is the final ruling 
Morrison appeals.

                           II. Analysis

     We review de novo the trial court's ruling on Morrison's 
motion for summary judgment, see Crawford v. Signet Bank, 
179 F.3d 926, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1999), as well as its grant of 
judgment as a matter of law to the appellees.  Richardson v. 

Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 857 F.2d 823, 827-28 (D.C. Cir. 
1988);  McNeal v. Hi-Lo Powered Scaffolding, Inc., 836 F.2d 
637, 640-41 (D.C. Cir.1988).  We review findings of fact for 
clear error, Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a);  Brock v. Mr. W Fireworks, 
Inc., 814 F.2d 1042, 1045 (5th Cir. 1987), but review de novo 
questions of law, including the question of employee status. 
See Mr. W Fireworks, 814 F.2d at 1045;  see also United 
States v. Bridges, 175 F.3d 1062, 1065 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  
Finally, our review of the trial court's evidentiary ruling is for 
abuse of discretion. See FRE 103(a);  see also United States v. 
Clarke, 24 F.3d 257, 265-67 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

     A.   Summary Judgment
          
     Morrison moved for summary judgment on counts I, II and 
III of her complaint on the ground that the IRS had preclu-
sively decided whether Morrison was an IPC employee under 
federal and D.C. labor law.  The district court denied the 
motion.  We affirm.

     The United States Supreme Court has "long favored appli-
cation of the common-law doctrines of collateral estoppel (as 
to issues) and res judicata (as to claims) to those determina-
tions of administrative bodies that have attained finality." 
Astoria Fed. Savings & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 
104, 107 (1991).  "When an administrative agency is acting in 
a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact proper-
ly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportu-
nity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res 
judicata to enforce repose."  United States v. Utah Constr. & 
Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 422 (1966).  Acting in a judicial 
capacity includes utilizing "procedure that seems an adequate 
substitute for judicial procedure."  18 Wright, Miller & Coo-
per, Federal Practice and Procedure s 4475, at 764-65 
(1981).  There is no evidence that the issue of Morrison's 
employment status was "actually and necessarily litigated and 
decided in a prior final judgment."  See Nasem v. Brown, 595 
F.2d 801, 805 (D.C. Cir. 1979).  The IRS was careful not to 
decide the accuracy of the information Hanlon presented to it.  
See Letter from Michael M. Greenspan, IRS District to 
Kathleen M. Hanlon (July 1, 1996), reprinted in JA 356.  We 

do not accept Morrison's assertion that Hanlon's right of 
appeal from the ruling converted the IRS determination into 
an adjudication of Morrison's employment status under the 
FLSA or D.C. labor laws.2  Accordingly, the IRS determina-
tion is not entitled to preclusive effect on the issue of Morri-
son's employment status and the district court properly de-
nied Morrison's motion for summary judgment on counts I, II 
and III.

     B.   Evidentiary Ruling
          
     The district court excluded as irrelevant IPC's submissions 
to the IRS as well as documents relating to the IRS assess-
ment and levy on IPC's bank account.  JA 268.  Morrison 
argues that the evidence was relevant to the issue of the 
preclusive effect of the IRS action.  She does not argue that 
the evidence was relevant to any other issue, including wheth-
er she was an employee under the economic reality test.  
Because the IRS action had no preclusive effect on whether 
Morrison was an employee under the FLSA and D.C. labor 
laws, its exclusion was proper;  the evidence was not relevant 
to any issue before the court.  Fed. R. Evid. 402.

     C.   Judgment as a Matter of Law
          
     Rule 50(a) provides that "[i]f during a trial by jury a party 
has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally 

__________
     2 Morrison's reliance on the order in Alten v. Ellin & Tucker, 
Chartered, 854 F. Supp. 283 (D. Del. 1994), does not carry the day 
for her.  In Alten the district court gave preclusive effect to an IRS 
assessment based on the taxpayer's wilful failure to meet his tax 
obligations. When the taxpayer sought indemnification from his 
accountants, the district court granted the defendants' motion for 
summary judgment on the ground that one who "wilfully" violates 
the law is not entitled, as a matter of law, to indemnification.  Id. at 
292.  In giving the IRS assessment preclusive effect, the court 
explained that the IRS had acted in a judicial capacity and that the 
taxpayer, by choosing to sue for indemnification instead of appeal-
ing the IRS assessment, attempted to bypass the prescribed appeal 
procedures of the agency.  Id.  The order, however, does not 
address the question whether an IRS assessment is entitled to 
collateral estoppel effect on the issue Morrison presents.

sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for 
that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue 
against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a 
matter of law against the party with respect to a claim or 
defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained 
or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue."  Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 50(a).  At the close of Morrison's case, the magis-
trate judge, after furnishing Hanlon a copy of Rule 50, 
entertained a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  The 
judge then ruled from the bench that "there is no legally 
sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for 
the plaintiff." JA 299.  The court explained that during July 
1995 Morrison was not an employee under the economic 
reality test set forth by the Second Circuit in Brock v. 
Superior Care, Inc., 840 F.2d 1054 (2d Cir. 1988).  In so 
doing the court emphasized, inter alia, the following facts:3  
(1) Morrison submitted her invoices on her own letterhead, 
(2) she believed that she was an independent contractor, (3) 
IPC filed 1099 tax forms, rather than W-2 tax forms, for her, 
(4) she received only minimal direction from Hanlon, (5) there 
was no evidence that Hanlon was present in the office on the 
days in which Morrison worked, (6) there was no evidence 
that Hanlon required Morrison to report on a daily basis, (7) 
Morrison worked at home on "some occasions," (8) there was 
no evidence that Morrison's work was an integral part of 
IPC's business and (9) she had only one task for July 1995, 
which was of limited scope and duration.

     The FLSA defines "employee" as "any individual employed 
by an employer."  To "employ" includes "to suffer or permit 
to work." 29 U.S.C. ss 203(e)(1), 203(g).  "The definition is 
necessarily a broad one in accordance with the remedial 
purpose of the Act."  Superior Care, 840 F.2d at 1058.  The 
statutory definition, however, provides no specific guidance.  

__________
     3 Whether an individual is an "employee" within the meaning of 
the FLSA is a legal question.  See Herman v. RSR Sec. Servs. Ltd., 
172 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 1999);  Castillo v. Givens, 704 F.2d 181, 
185 (5th Cir. 1983).  Nevertheless, "[a]ny subsidiary factual issues 
leading to this conclusion are, of course, questions of fact for the 
jury."  Castillo, 704 F.2d at 185 n.9.

In Goldberg v. Whitaker House Coop., Inc., 366 U.S. 28, 33 
(1961), the Supreme Court directed courts to look at "econom-
ic reality" rather than "technical concepts" to determine 
employment status under the FLSA.  The "test considers the 
extent to which typical employer prerogatives govern the 
relationship between the putative employer and employee."  
Henthorn v. Department of Navy, 29 F.3d 682, 684 (D.C. Cir. 
1994).  In Henthorn we explained that we ask "whether the 
alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire the 
employees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work 
schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the 
rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment 
records." Id. (citation omitted).  In Superior Care, the Sec-
ond Circuit case relied upon by the magistrate judge, the 
court set forth a different, although similar, set of factors.  
These include:  (1) the degree of control exercised by the 
employer over the workers, (2) the workers' opportunity for 
profit or loss and their investment in the business, (3) the 
degree of skill and independent initiative required to perform 
the work, (4) the permanence or duration of the working 
relationship and (5) the extent to which the work is an 
integral part of the employer's business.  Superior Care, 840 
F.2d at 1058-59.  No one factor standing alone is dispositive 
and courts are directed to look at the totality of the circum-
stances and consider any relevant evidence.  See Herman, 
172 F.3d at 139;  Superior Care, 840 F.2d at 1059;  see also 
Usery v. Pilgrim Equip. Co., 527 F.2d 1308, 1311-12 (5th Cir. 
1976) ("It is dependence that indicates employee status.  
Each test must be applied with that ultimate notion in mind.  
More importantly, the final and determinative question must 
be whether the total of the testing establishes the personnel 
are so dependent upon the business with which they are 
connected that they come within the protection of the FLSA 
or are sufficiently independent to lie outside its ambit." 
(emphasis original)).

     Under Rule 50 the court was required to view the facts in 
the light most favorable to Morrison.  So viewing the facts 
manifests that IPC "had the power to hire and fire" her, 
"supervised and controlled [her] work schedules or conditions 

of employment" and "determined the rate and method of 
payment." Henthorn, 29 F.3d at 684.  The evidence also 
showed that Hanlon and IPC exercised a considerable "de-
gree of control" over Morrison and that she had little "oppor-
tunity for profit or loss" and made no "investment in the 
business."  Superior Care, 840 F.2d at 1058.

     The district court stressed Morrison's description of herself 
as a consultant.  "[F]acile labels and subjective factors[, 
however,] are only relevant to the extent that they mirror 
'economic reality.' "  Mr. W Fireworks, 814 F.2d at 1044;  cf. 
Superior Care, 840 F.2d at 1059 (employer's admission that 
individual was employee is "highly probative").  And Morri-
son's self description may not reflect economic reality.  For 
example, Morrison presented evidence that she did "every-
thing from recruiting, planning meetings, going to the bank, 
going to the post office, doing administrative things, [and] 
watering the plants."  JA 63.  She also testified that she was 
required to prepare daily activity sheets as well as weekly "to 
do lists" and summaries of her weekly activities.  See JA 66-
70, 314, 317, 318.  Although the trial court found that Hanlon 
exercised infrequent supervision, Morrison's testimony, the 
"to do lists" (Plaintiff's Exhibit 7) and Hanlon's request for a 
weekly plan of activities (Plaintiff's Exhibit 11) indicate that 
Hanlon exercised more than minimal supervision.  See JA 
314, 318.  Supervision need not be frequent under the eco-
nomic reality test.  See Superior Care, 840 F.2d at 1060.  
Morrison introduced evidence, including requests for time off, 
that tended to show that Hanlon regulated Morrion's hours.  
JA 67-68, 315, 316.  In fact, Morrison was ultimately fired, in 
part, for taking "Monday and Tuesday" off.  See JA 323.  
The fact that Morrison sometimes worked irregular hours or 
that she worked at home does not preclude a finding that she 
was an employee under the economic reality test.  Likewise, 
Hanlon's absence from the office during the time Morrison 
performed her work is largely irrelevant in view of the 
restrictions Hanlon otherwise imposed on Morrison's work 
schedule.  Hanlon paid Morrison on a daily or hourly basis, 
including overtime pay on occasion.  See JA 77, 325-26.  
Finally, although Morrison was assigned a specific task for 

July 1995 (the Moldova project), she testified that she contin-
ued to perform her "regular duties" and kept working for 
IPC after the tour ended on July 21st.  See JA 71-72, 116-17, 
328-29, 335.  Based on our review of the record, we conclude 
that the district court erroneously granted the appellees' 
motion for judgment as a matter of law on all counts of 
Morrison's complaint.4

                         III. Conclusion

     We affirm the trial court's denial of Morrison's motion for 
partial summary judgment as well as the court's evidentiary 
ruling.  We reverse, however, its grant of judgment as a 
matter of law to the appellees and remand for further pro-
ceedings.

                                        So ordered.

     4 Moreover, the district court erroneously dismissed count IV of 
Morrison's complaint, which sought reimbursement for expendi-
tures she made during the Moldova project. Reimbursement for her 
expenses did not depend on her work status at IPC.
