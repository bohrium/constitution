     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Three United Airlines passengers, 
on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, sued 
United under an international treaty known as the Warsaw 
Convention to recover the value of baggage lost on interna-
tional flights.  Without reaching the question of class certifi-
cation, the district court granted summary judgment against 
the three named plaintiffs, on the ground that each had 
entered into an accord and satisfaction with United by accept-
ing a check from the air carrier "in full and complete settle-
ment of any and all claims."  We affirm the judgment of the 
district court.

                                I

     In September 1998, James Curtin flew from Cork, Ireland 
to Dulles Airport in Virginia.  After landing at Dulles, he 
reported that a bag of golf clubs, estimated to be worth $921, 
was missing.  In January 1999, Margaret Wombacher flew 
from London to Chicago.  One of her bags never arrived in 
Chicago, and she reported a loss of $1855.  In the same 
month, David Simmons flew from London to Atlanta, connect-
ing through Chicago.  His bag made it to Chicago but not to 
Atlanta, and he filed a claim for $1355.

     In response to the claims for compensation filed by Curtin 
and Wombacher, United sent each a letter stating:

     Because your itinerary involved an international destina-
     tion, claim settlement is governed by the 'Warsaw Con-
     vention' which limits our liability to $635 due to loss, 
     damage or delay.
     
J.A. at 35, 126.  It sent Simmons a slightly different letter, 
which read:

     As your trip involved international travel, payment for 
     your loss is based on the weight of your checked bag.  
     The maximum liability our company assumes is $9.07 per 
     pound, up to 70 pounds per checked item unless excess 
     valuation is declared and purchased prior to travel.  Our 
     check for $635 in settlement for the missing property, 
     will be mailed to you shortly.
     
J.A. at 116.  Subsequently, United mailed each plaintiff a 
check for $635.  Above the endorsement line on each check 
was the following legend:

     By endorsement of this check payee(s) agree that the 
     amount shown is accepted in full and complete settlement 
     of any and all claims which payee(s) may have against 
     United Air Lines, Inc., its connecting carriers, their 
     agents or employees for loss, damage or delay sustained 
     by reason of an incident involving a United flight.
     
J.A. at 36, 119, 127.  Curtin, Wombacher, and Simmons all 
signed and deposited their checks, the latter after consulting 
with an attorney.1

     Article 18 of the Warsaw Convention, an international air 
carriage treaty ratified by the United States in 1934, creates 
a cause of action against an air carrier for loss of or damage 
to a passenger's checked baggage.  49 U.S.C. s 40105 note.  
Article 22(2) of the Convention limits a carrier's liability for 
such loss to a maximum of 250 francs per kilogram, or $9.07 
per pound.  See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Franklin Mint 
Corp., 466 U.S. 243 (1984).  United calculated its liability to 
each plaintiff as no more than $635--the amount it tendered 
by check--because the maximum weight of a bag permitted 
on its flights was 70 pounds.  Article 4(3) of the Convention, 
however, requires that baggage checks contain certain partic-
ulars, including the number and weight of the bags, and 
Article 4(4) states that "if the baggage check does not con-

     1 Wombacher signed only after inserting the word "not" before 
the phrase "accepted in full and complete settlement" on the back of 
the check.  The district court held that the validity of the release 
was not affected by the insertion of "not."  Curtin v. United 
Airlines, Inc., 120 F. Supp. 2d 73, 77 n.2 (D.D.C. 2000) (citing 
Restatement (Second) of Contracts s 281 cmt. d, illus. 6 (1979) 
(explaining that a creditor cannot avoid the consequences of cashing 
a check offered as payment in full by declaring that he regards it as 
part payment));  see U.C.C. s 3-311 cmt. 2 (noting that a seller who 
deposits a check accepts the accord notwithstanding that he "adds a 
notation to the check indicating that the check is accepted under 
protest or in only partial satisfaction of the claim").  Plaintiffs do 
not challenge that ruling on appeal.

tain" those particulars "the carrier shall not be entitled to 
avail himself of those provisions of the convention which 
exclude or limit his liability."  It is undisputed that United 
did not record the weight of any of the plaintiffs' bags.

     In Cruz v. American Airlines, Inc., 193 F.3d 526 (D.C. Cir. 
1999), this circuit ruled that the plain language of Article 4(4) 
precludes an air carrier's invocation of the liability limits of 
Article 22(2) when it has not recorded the weight of the 
baggage.  Cruz acknowledged that passengers are not preju-
diced by an airline's failure to note a bag's weight if the 
carrier's maximum weight allowance is used to determine the 
amount of its liability, and that in such circumstances the 
recording requirement "makes little real sense."  Id. at 529.  
Nonetheless, Cruz concluded that "the language of the Con-
vention is unyielding and we have no warrant to dispense 
with portions we might think purposeless."  Id.

     This case was filed on November 17, 1999, five weeks after 
the decision in Cruz.  The First Amended Complaint was 
brought by Curtin, Wombacher, and Simmons, as a class 
action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situat-
ed.2  The class was defined as all persons who checked 
baggage on an international United flight "without the weight 
of that baggage having been recorded," and who received 
payment of less than what they claimed was the fair value of 
the loss of or damage to that baggage--such payment "being 
an amount (usually $635) which United asserted or believed 
was the limit of its liability for such baggage loss/damage 
under Warsaw's Article 22(2) $9.07 per pound liability limita-
tion."  First Am. Compl. p 5.  Plaintiffs proposed a class 
period "beginning the two years prior to initiation of this suit 
and ending on March 3, 1999."  Id.3  They claimed that they

     2 Curtin was the only plaintiff named in the original complaint.  
The court granted subsequent petitions by Wombacher and Sim-
mons to intervene as additional plaintiffs and putative class repre-
sentatives.  J.A. at 83.

     3 Effective March 4, 1999, amendments to the Warsaw Conven-
tion eliminated Article 4's requirement that the weight of checked 
baggage be recorded.  Montreal Protocol No. 4 to Amend the 

were entitled to recover the full value of their lost or dam-
aged baggage, and that the Warsaw Convention's liability 
limit was inapplicable because the weight of their baggage 
had not been recorded on their baggage checks.

     United moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 56, raising the defense of accord and 
satisfaction by virtue of plaintiffs' endorsement and deposit of 
the checks that United had tendered in settlement of their 
claims.  Plaintiffs countered that there were no valid accords 
and satisfactions, and that even if there were, they should be 
rescinded on the grounds of mistake and/or misrepresenta-
tion.  Plaintiffs also asked the district court to permit discov-
ery and to rule on the issue of class certification before 
addressing defendant's motion for summary judgment.  The 
district court denied those requests and granted United's 
motion.

                                II

     We begin with two preliminary matters:  plaintiffs' conten-
tions that the district court erred by deciding United's motion 
for summary judgment (1) without permitting discovery and 
(2) without ruling on the question of class certification.  The 
first of these arguments is readily dispatched.  Although it is 
true that summary judgment ordinarily "is proper only after 
the plaintiff has been given adequate time for discovery," 
First Chicago Int'l v. United Exch. Co., 836 F.2d 1375, 1380 
(D.C. Cir. 1988), plaintiffs' briefs fail to identify any facts 
essential to opposing United's motion as to which discovery is 
needed.  Moreover, at oral argument, plaintiffs agreed that in 
light of factual concessions made by United below, all the 
facts required to decide the summary judgment issue are 
already in the record and further discovery is unnecessary.  
See also Appellants' Br. at 18, 27.  Accordingly, there is no 
possible ground for reversing the district court's denial of

tional Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw on October 12, 1929, as 
amended by the Protocol Done at the Hague on September 8, 1955, 
reprinted in S. Exec. Rep. No. 105-20, at 21-32 (1998).

discovery.  See Moore v. United States, 213 F.3d 705, 710 n.3 
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that "a district court may deny 
discovery requests when additional facts are not necessary to 
resolve the summary judgment motion");  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) 
(providing that the court may continue an application for 
summary judgment to give time for discovery if the opposing 
party "cannot ... present by affidavit facts essential to 
justify the party's opposition").

     The certification issue detains us only slightly longer.  The 
plaintiffs assert that the district court was obliged to deter-
mine whether their suit could proceed as a class action before 
it could consider the merits of their individual claims, in light 
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c) and the Supreme 
Court's holding in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 
(1979).  Neither of these authorities, however, suggests that a 
court is barred from rendering an easy decision on an individ-
ual claim to avoid an unnecessary and harder decision on the 
propriety of certification.

     We begin with Rule 23(c), which states only that the 
district court shall determine whether a case may be main-
tained as a class action "[a]s soon as practicable after the 
commencement of [the] action."  As the Seventh Circuit has 
noted, although a certification decision will usually be "practi-
cable" before the case is ripe for summary judgment, that will 
not always be so, and the word " 'practicable' allows for 
wiggle room"--enough to make the order of disposition of 
motions for summary judgment and class certification a ques-
tion of discretion for the trial court.  Cowen v. Bank United 
of Texas, 70 F.3d 937, 941 (7th Cir. 1995);  see Telfair v. First 
Union Mortgage Corp., 216 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir. 2000);  
Thompson v. County of Medina, 29 F.3d 238, 240-41 (6th Cir. 
1994);  Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 677 n.12 (10th Cir. 
1988);  Christensen v. Kiewit-Murdock Inv. Corp., 815 F.2d 
206, 214 (2d Cir. 1987);  Wright v. Schock, 742 F.2d 541, 544 
(9th Cir. 1984).

     Nor is Eisen to the contrary.  There, the Court reversed a 
district court that had held a preliminary hearing on the 
merits of the case in order to decide whether the plaintiff 

should be required to bear the cost of notice to the members 
of the asserted class.  "We find nothing in either the lan-
guage or history of Rule 23," the Court said, "that gives a 
court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the 
merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be 
maintained as a class action."  Eisen, 417 U.S. at 177 
(emphasis added).4  Nothing of the sort occurred here.  The 
district court did not conduct a preliminary inquiry, but 
rather reached a final resolution on summary judgment.5  
Moreover, it did so to determine not whether the case could 
be maintained as a class action, but rather whether any of the 
named plaintiffs had a viable claim on the merits.  Under 
such circumstances, nothing in Eisen or Rule 23(c) requires 
the district court to rule on class certification before granting 
or denying a motion for summary judgment.  See Thompson, 
29 F.3d at 240-41;  Wright, 742 F.2d at 544-46.

     As plaintiffs note, it is often more efficient and fairer to the 
parties to decide the class question first.  But that was not so 
in this case where, as we discuss below, the district court 
readily and correctly perceived fatal flaws in plaintiffs' claims.  
Reversing the usual order of disposition in such circum-
stances spares both the parties and the court a needless, 
time-consuming inquiry into certification.  See Federal Judi-
cial Center, Manual for Complex Litigation (Third) s 30.11 
(1995) (stating that "[w]hen it is clear that the action lacks 
merit, dismissal [before certification] will avoid unnecessary 
expense for the parties and burdens for the court").

__________
     4 See also Miller v. Mackey Int'l, Inc., 452 F.2d 424, 437 (5th Cir. 
1971) ("In determining the propriety of a class action, the question 
is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action 
or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements 
of Rule 23 are met." (emphasis added)), quoted in Eisen, 417 U.S. 
at 178.

     5 In Eisen, the Court expressed concern "that a preliminary 
determination of the merits may result in substantial prejudice to a 
defendant, since ... [t]he court's tentative findings, made in the 
absence of established [trial] safeguards, may color the subsequent 
proceedings...."  417 U.S. at 178.

     Plaintiffs also observe that it is often more protective of the 
interests of defendants to begin with the issue of class 
certification, because only a merits decision made after certifi-
cation will bind all members of the class.  But here, the 
defendant itself sought an early decision on the merits and, 
needless to say, does not suggest that it was prejudiced by 
winning on that basis.  Nor do the named plaintiffs suggest 
any prejudice to their own interests traceable to the order in 
which the district court made its decision, rather than to the 
decision itself.  The plaintiffs do contend that, due to the 
passage of time since the lawsuit began, when the suit is 
dismissed putative class members "will be left holding a time 
barred claim."  Appellants' Br. at 22.  That contention, how-
ever, is simply incorrect.  The filing of a class action tolls the 
statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class, 
and potential plaintiffs other than the three named in this 
case remain free to file their own suits against United.  See 
Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 353-54 
(1983).  They will, of course, face the problem of stare decisis 
(at least in this circuit), but even so their legal position is 
better than it would be if the merits decision had been made 
after class certification--in which case they would face the 
bar of res judicata.

     In sum, in circumstances like these, where the merits of the 
plaintiffs' claims can be readily resolved on summary judg-
ment, where the defendant seeks an early disposition of those 
claims, and where the plaintiffs are not prejudiced thereby, a 
district court does not abuse its discretion by resolving the 
merits before considering the question of class certification.

                               III

     We now turn to plaintiffs' challenge to the district court's 
grant of summary judgment in favor of United on the ground 
that plaintiffs' damage claims are barred by the doctrine of 
accord and satisfaction.  We review the district court's deci-
sion to grant summary judgment de novo, and may affirm 

only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  
Borgo v. Goldin, 204 F.3d 251, 254 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing 
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986)).

     Plaintiffs contend that (1) there were no valid accords and 
satisfactions in this case, and (2) even if there were, they 
should be rescinded on the grounds of mistake and/or misrep-
resentation.  We consider each of these arguments below.  
Plaintiffs maintain that we should look to federal common law 
to decide these issues, while United urges us to look to the 
law of each individual passenger's domicile.  That, however, is 
a dispute we need not resolve.  Both sides agree that the 
Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) and the Restatement 
(Second) of Contracts provide the applicable legal standards 
regardless of which law governs.6  And neither side cites any 
case to suggest that the choice of law would effect a differ-

     6 All arguably relevant jurisdictions--Colorado (Curtin's and 
Wombacher's domicile), Georgia (Simmons' domicile and where his 
bag was reported missing), Illinois (United's principal place of 
business and where Wombacher's bag was reported missing), and 
Virginia (where Curtin's bag was reported missing)--have enacted 
U.C.C. s 3-311, which establishes the elements of accord and 
satisfaction.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. s 4-3-311;  Ga. Code Ann. 
s 11-3-311;  810 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-311;  Va. Code Ann. 
s 8.3A-311;  see also Curtin v. United Airlines, Inc., 120 F. Supp. 
2d 73, 76 n.1 (finding that "all relevant jurisdictions rely on the 
U.C.C. s 3-311 and Restatement (Second) of Contracts s 281 defi-
nitions of accord and satisfaction, which codify the common law 
doctrine").  Courts also often look to the U.C.C. and Restatement 
when deciding questions of federal common law.  See, e.g., O'Neill 
v. United States, 50 F.3d 677, 684 (9th Cir. 1995) (relying on the 
U.C.C. as "a source of federal common law");  FDIC v. Tennessee 
Wildcat Servs., Inc., 839 F.2d 251, 253 (6th Cir. 1988) (same);  see 
also, e.g., Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 439 (D.C. Cir. 
1997) (explaining that the principles of the Restatement (Second) of 
Contracts are those "from which we would be inclined to fashion a 
federal common-law rule");  Turner v. American Fed'n of Teachers 
Local 1565, 138 F.3d 878, 882 (11th Cir. 1998) (using the Restate-
ment (Second) of Contracts as a source of federal common law).

ence in the interpretation of the relevant U.C.C. or Restate-
ment provisions.

                                A

     U.C.C. s 3-311 is entitled "Accord and Satisfaction by Use 
of Instrument."  It provides, with exceptions not relevant 
here, that a claim is discharged if the person against whom 
the claim is asserted proves that:  "(i) that person in good 
faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfac-
tion of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated 
or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant 
obtained payment of the instrument."  U.C.C. s 3-311(a).  In 
addition, the instrument or an accompanying written commu-
nication must contain "a conspicuous statement to the effect 
that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the 
claim."  U.C.C. s 3-311(b).7

     The district court held that United's tender to each plaintiff 
of a check for $635, stamped with the legend that the payee's 
endorsement would constitute acceptance in "full and com-
plete settlement of any and all claims which payee(s) may 
have against United Air Lines, Inc.," became an effective 
accord and satisfaction when the plaintiff signed and deposit-
ed the check.  See U.C.C. s 3-311 cmts. 2, 3 (noting that an 
accord and satisfaction occurs when a seller deposits a check 
marked with the notation that it is in full satisfaction of a 
bill).  On appeal, plaintiffs' challenge relies only upon the 
second U.C.C. requirement:  that the amount of the claim be 
unliquidated.  The Restatement defines an "unliquidated" 
obligation as one "that is uncertain or disputed in amount."  
s 74 cmt. c.  Plaintiffs contend that United's correspondence 
conceded the carrier's liability for $635, and thereby showed 

__________
     7 The Restatement provides that "[a]n accord is a contract under 
which an obligee promises to accept a substituted performance in 
future satisfaction of the obligor's duty," s 281 cmt. a, and that 
"[p]erformance of the accord discharges the original duty," s 281(1).  
It further states that "[t]he enforceability of an accord is governed 
by the rules applicable to the enforceability of contracts in general."  
s 281 cmt. d.

that United regarded each claim as an undisputed, "liquidated 
claim for $635."  Appellants' Br. at 10.

     At oral argument, plaintiffs agreed that, at least if consid-
ered in isolation, the legend stamped on United's checks 
indicated United's view that the amount in question was not 
undisputed, since it stated that endorsement would constitute 
"settlement" of all claims.  Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend 
that the clarity of the check legend was muddied by United's 
earlier letters.  Those letters, plaintiffs assert, did not dem-
onstrate an intention to compromise or settle, but instead 
flatly stated that United's liability was limited to $635--and 
thus rendered that amount a liquidated claim.

     This argument has two principal defects.  First, the lan-
guage of the letters that United sent to the plaintiffs is not 
materially different from the language on the checks.  Like 
the checks, all three letters used the word "settlement" to 
describe the nature of the transaction between the parties.8  
Second, and more important, there is simply no question but 
that the parties did consider the amount of the claims to be in 
dispute, and hence that the $635 figure was far from "liqui-
dated."  The three plaintiffs clearly did not regard $635 as 
the amount they were owed, since their demands were for 
$921, $1855, and $1355.  Nor did United signal agreement 
that the amount it owed was in fact $635.  Rather, the carrier 
described $635 as the "limit[ ]" or "maximum" of its liability.  
That figure was calculated solely on the basis of the maximum 
weight of plaintiffs' luggage, and could have been reduced had 
United successfully challenged plaintiffs' estimates of the 
value of the bags' contents.9

__________
     8 See J.A. 35, 126 (letters to Curtin and Wombacher, stating that 
"claim settlement" is governed by the Warsaw Convention);  J.A. 
116 (letter to Simmons, stating that United's check for $635 "in 
settlement" will be mailed shortly).

     9 Moreover, even "[a]n admission by the obligor that a minimum 
amount is due does not liquidate the claim even partially unless he 
is contractually bound to the admission."  Restatement (Second) of 
Contracts s 74 cmt. c.

     There is only one way in which the $635 tendered by 
United could be considered evidence of a liquidated claim:  if 
it were the law that a debtor automatically turns a debt (or a 
portion thereof) into a liquidated sum simply by offering a 
fixed amount in settlement.  But if that were the law, there 
would be no such thing as an accord and satisfaction:  every 
offer to settle a debt would liquidate the debt (at least to the 
extent of the offer), rendering every such offer ineligible 
under U.C.C. s 3-311(a)(ii).  In this case, in order to dis-
charge a claim, United paid more than it conceded owing and 
plaintiffs accepted less than they conceded being owed.  That 
is more than sufficient to satisfy U.C.C. s 3-311(a)(ii),10 and 
the fact that the amount accepted was the same as the 
amount tendered no more justifies calling plaintiffs' claims 
"liquidated" than it would those in any other dispute.  Ac-
cordingly, we conclude that the tender, endorsement, and 
deposit of each check constituted a valid accord and satisfac-
tion.11

__________
     10 The U.C.C. does not require that the party against whom the 
claim is asserted offer an amount different from the amount it 
believes it owes.  Rather, the party "against whom the claim is 
asserted may attempt an accord and satisfaction of the disputed 
claim by tendering a check to the claimant for some amount less 
than the full amount claimed by the claimant"--just as United did 
here.  U.C.C. s 3-311 cmt. 1.

     11 Plaintiffs also argue that the printed legend on United's checks 
demonstrated an absence of the good faith necessary for a valid 
accord and satisfaction.  In support, they cite U.C.C. s 3-311 cmt. 
4.  That comment, however, refers only to "the practice of some 
business debtors in routinely printing full satisfaction language" on 
all or most of their checks, "whether or not there is any dispute 
with the creditor."  In such cases, the comment states, "the claim-
ant cannot be sure whether a tender in full satisfaction is or is not 
being made," and the practice may therefore "prevent an accord 
and satisfaction on the ground that the check was not tendered in 
good faith."  Here, plaintiffs assert neither that United routinely 
printed the settlement legend on its checks, nor that they did not 
understand that tenders in full satisfaction were being made to 
them.

                                B

     Finally, plaintiffs contend that, even if there were valid 
accords and satisfactions in this case, they should be rescind-
ed on the grounds of mistake (unilateral or mutual) and/or 
misrepresentation.12  For either doctrine to apply in this case, 
United's statements to plaintiffs must--at a minimum--have 
been "not in accord with the facts."13  The point that was not 
in accord with the facts here, plaintiffs contend, was United's 
claim that its maximum liability was limited to $635, the 
product of $9.07 and the maximum weight of each plaintiff's 
lost bag.  Plaintiffs argue that, because the Warsaw Conven-
tion's liability limit applied only if United's baggage checks 
recorded the bags' actual weights, and because United's 
checks concededly did not do so, United's claim that there 
was any limit to its liability at all (other than the fair value of 
the lost baggage) was in error.

     Had United's letters been sent or its checks tendered or 
deposited after this court's decision in Cruz, plaintiffs might 
have an argument for their position.  But all of those events 
transpired months before Cruz was issued,14 and that subse-

equity, including ... the law relative to ... misrepresentation ... 
[and] mistake," shall "supplement" the provisions of the U.C.C.);  
Restatement (Second) of Contracts s 152 (entitled "When Mistake 
of Both Parties Makes a Contract Voidable");  id. s 153 (entitled 
"When Mistake of One Party Makes a Contract Voidable");  id. 
s 164 (entitled "When a Misrepresentation Makes a Contract Void-
able").

     13 See Restatement (Second) of Contracts s 151 ("A mistake is a 
belief that is not in accord with the facts.");  id. s 159 ("A misrepre-
sentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the facts.");  see 
also id. s 151 cmt. b (stating that "[f]acts include law" and that "[a] 
party's erroneous belief with respect to the law ... may, therefore, 
come within these rules");  id. s 170 cmt. a ("A statement as to a 
matter of law is subject to the same rules as are other assertions.").

     14 The letters to Curtin, Wombacher, and Simmons were mailed 
in February, May, and March of 1999, respectively.  The plaintiffs 

quent decision can therefore play no role in the analysis.  
Instead, we must look to the state of the law at the time of 
the events in question.  See Restatement (Second) of Con-
tracts s 152 (providing that a mutual mistake capable of 
voiding a contract must be a mistake "at the time [the] 
contract was made");  id. s 153 (same with respect to unilat-
eral mistake);  id. s 159 cmt. c ("An assertion must relate to 
something that is a fact at the time the assertion is made in 
order to be a misrepresentation.").  At that time, the applica-
bility of Article 22(2)'s liability limit in the absence of the 
recording of weights required by Article 4 was an unsettled 
question, and the existing law provided a more than adequate 
basis for United to conclude that its view was correct.  Cf. 
Moses-Ecco Co. v. Roscoe-Ajax Corp., 320 F.2d 685, 690 
(D.C. Cir. 1963) (holding that "a settlement payment, made 
when the law was uncertain, cannot be successfully attacked 
on the basis of any subsequent resolution of the uncertainty").

     When the accords and satisfactions in this case were 
reached, no Supreme Court or D.C. Circuit case had yet 
addressed the question subsequently decided in Cruz.15  The 
only federal appellate court to have considered the question, 
the Second Circuit, had held--consistent with United's view--
that the liability limit of Article 22(2) continued to apply 
notwithstanding a failure to follow the requirements of Article 
4.16  Two of the three state appellate courts to have ruled had

deposited their checks between March and June of 1999.  See J.A. 
36, 119, 127.  Cruz did not issue until October 12, 1999.

     15 Plaintiffs call our attention to Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Inc., 
490 U.S. 122 (1989), a case that did not involve the baggage liability 
limitation question at issue here.  Chan held that Article 3 of the 
Warsaw Convention does not eliminate the Convention's limitation 
on damages for passenger injury or death when the carrier fails to 
provide adequate notice of the limitation on its passenger tickets.  
Id. at 135.  Although the Court held that its decision in Chan was 
"governed by the text" of the Convention, id. at 134, it had no 
occasion to consider the text of Article 4 or its meaning.

F.2d 232 (2d Cir. 1987) (regarding commercial shippers).

also decided in accord with United's position.17  So, too, had 
many federal district judges,18 including all that had ruled in 
this circuit,19 although district courts had ruled the other way 
as well.20  Moreover, the position expressed in United's let-
ters was supported by advice to passengers published by the 
United States Department of Transportation.  See Aviation 
Consumer Prot. Div., U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fly Rights:  A 
Consumer Guide to Air Travel ch. 5 (10th rev. ed. 1994) 
(stating that an airline may limit its liability under the 
Warsaw Convention to $9.07 per pound if, "[i]nstead of weigh-
ing [the] luggage, the carrier assumes that each of [the] bags 
weighs the maximum that it agrees to accept as checked 
baggage, usually 70 pounds," and noting that this "yields a 
liability limit of about $640 per bag").

makes a misrepresentation or mistake by reaching a conclu-
sion that is well supported by existing law.  Measuring 
United's statement against the state of the law at the relevant 
time, we reject plaintiffs' contention that the accords and 
satisfactions are void for misrepresentation or mistake.21

                                IV

     We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's 
decision to rule on United's motion for summary judgment 
without first permitting discovery or ruling on class certifica-
tion.  Nor do we discern any error in the district court's 
grant of summary judgment in United's favor.  Accordingly, 
the judgment of the district court is

     21 Because we conclude that there was no misrepresentation (or 
mistake), we need not address the "troublesome" issue of when one 
party's reliance on an assertion as to a matter of law by another 
party is justified.  Restatement (Second) of Contracts s 164 cmt.
