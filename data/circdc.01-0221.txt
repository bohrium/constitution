     Before:  Henderson, Randolph and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Kaspar Wire Works, Inc. petitions 
for review of the decision of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Review Commission holding it responsible for hun-
dreds of willful violations of the Occupational Health and 
Safety Act, 29 U.S.C. ss 651-678 (1990), and imposing penal-
ties for each violation.  Kaspar Wire contends that the deci-
sion must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence to 
support the findings of willfulness, and because the per 
instance penalties are unlawful.  We deny the petition.

                                I.

     Kaspar Wire Works, Inc. is a manufacturer of custom wire 
products and newspaper racks located in Shiner, Texas.  Be-
tween 1982 and 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration ("OSHA") conducted inspections and issued 
no citations for injury and illness recordkeeping violations.  
However, following a six-month inspection by nine OSHA 
inspectors in 1990, the Secretary of Labor issued two cita-
tions against Kaspar Wire for over 400 alleged willful and 
serious violations of various standards under the Act, propos-
ing aggregate penalties of $1,236,000.  An Administrative 
Law Judge found that 382 violations were willful and assessed 
an aggregate penalty of $257,700.

     The Occupational Safety and Health Commission affirmed 
the findings of willfulness and the assessment of per-instance 
penalties for most of the recordkeeping violations, resulting in 
an aggregate penalty of $224,050.  The Commission relied on 
evidence that the same personnel had been responsible for 
recording serious injuries and illnesses at Kaspar Wire since 
1970, that Kaspar Wire had properly reported such incidents 
in the past, as reflected in the results of OSHA inspections 
from 1982-89, and that OSHA's 1990 inspection revealed that 
Kaspar Wire failed to record 357 injuries on form OSHA No. 
200, comprising 86.5% of the injuries and illnesses that oc-
curred in its facility during 1988 and 1989.  Included among 
the unreported injuries were second- and third-degree burns, 

a hand ligament injury resulting in 171 lost work days, at 
least eight finger amputations (including one employee who 
lost three fingers and lost eight weeks of work and another 
employee who lost two fingers and lost nine weeks of work), 
several broken bones, more than 30 eye injuries, and hun-
dreds of lacerations--all of which were only recorded on 
Kaspar Wire's first-aid log.  The Commission concluded that 
these were knowing and willful violations that reflected a 
"profound[ ] change[ ]" in Kaspar Wire's recordkeeping prac-
tices.  One Commission member dissented on the ground that 
the evidence did not support a finding of willfulness, but only 
carelessness.  The Commission reversed the Administrative 
Law Judge's finding of willfulness with respect to errors in 
Kaspar Wire's restricted work day recording, because it had 
never recorded such items and had never been cited by 
OSHA for such failures in the past.

                               II.

     At the time of the citations in question, the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act ("the Act") provided that "Any em-
ployer who willfully or repeatedly violates the requirements 
of ... regulations prescribed pursuant to this chapter, may 
be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each 
violation."  29 U.S.C. s 666(a) (1990).1  The Act further pro-
vided:

     Each employer shall make, keep and preserve, and make 
     available to the Secretary [of Labor] or the Secretary of 
     Health and Human Services, such records regarding his 
     activities relating to this chapter as the Secretary [of 
     
__________
     1  The penalty amounts were increased in November 1990 to 
"not more than $70,000 for each violation, but not less than $5,000 
for each willful violation."  See id. (1999);  Omnibus Budget Recon-
ciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, s 3101, 104 Stat. 1388 
(1990).  In assessing penalties against Kaspar Wire, the Commis-
sion applied the version of the statute in effect in September 1990, 
when the citations were issued.  The other statutory and regulatory 
provisions relevant to this opinion have remained unchanged since 
that time.

     Labor], in cooperation with the Secretary of Health and 
     Human Services, may prescribe by regulation as neces-
     sary or appropriate for the enforcement of this chapter 
     or for developing information regarding the causes and 
     prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses....
     
Id. s 657(c)(1).  The OSHA recordkeeping regulations re-
quire an employer to:

     (1) maintain in each establishment a log and summary of 
     all recordable occupational injuries and illnesses for that 
     establishment;  and (2) enter each recordable injury and 
     illness on the log and summary as early as practicable 
     but no later than 6 working days after receiving informa-
     tion that a recordable injury or illness has occurred.
     
29 C.F.R. s 1904.2(a) (2000).  The regulation further specifies 
that "[f]or this purpose form OSHA No. 200 or an equivalent 
which is as readable and comprehensive to a person not 
familiar with it shall be used.  The log and summary shall be 
completed in the detail provided in the form and instructions 
on form OSHA No. 200."  Id. "Recordable" is defined in the 
regulations to mean:

     any occupational injuries or illnesses which result in:
     
     (1)  Fatalities, regardless of the time between the injury 
          and death, or the length of the illness;  or
          
     (2)  Lost workday cases, other than fatalities, that result 
          in lost workdays;  or
          
     (3)  Nonfatal cases without lost workdays which result in 
          transfer to another job or termination of employ-
          ment, or require medical treatment (other than first 
          aid) or involve:  loss of consciousness or restriction 
          of work or motion.  This category also includes any 
          diagnosed occupational illnesses which are reported 
          to the employer but are not classified as fatalities or 
          lost workday cases.
          
Id. s 1904.12(c).  The Commission views the recordkeeping 
requirements as "play[ing] a crucial role in providing the 
information necessary to make workplaces safer and healthi-

er."  General Motors Corp., Inland Div., 8 O.S.H. Cas. 
(BNA) 2036 (1980).

     Kaspar Wire did not argue either to the Commission or to 
the court that its first aid log qualified as an "equivalent" to 
OSHA form No. 200.  Rather, Kaspar Wire admitted in its 
brief and at oral argument that it did not comply with OSHA 
recordkeeping requirements.  For three reasons it contends, 
however, that there is no basis for the Commission's finding 
that its violations were willful.  First, its recordkeeping per-
sonnel were trained by OSHA staff in 1971, and over the 
years OSHA inspectors repeatedly reviewed its practices 
without ever citing Kaspar Wire for a recordkeeping violation 
until the 1990 inspection.  Second, an OSHA inspector testi-
fied that it was reasonable for Kaspar Wire to assume that its 
recordkeeping practices were in compliance with OSHA regu-
lations.  Third, there is no record evidence that Kaspar Wire 
changed its recordkeeping practices at some point in the 
1980s.  Kaspar Wire concludes, therefore, that its reasonable 
reliance precludes a finding of willfulness.

     Neither the Act nor the OSHA regulations define the 
meaning of the term "willful."  This circuit has defined a 
"willful violation" in the OSHA context as "an act done 
voluntarily with either an intentional disregard of, or plain 
indifference to, the Act's requirements."  Conie Construction, 
Inc. v. Reich, 73 F.3d 382, 384 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The Commis-
sion relied on the Fifth Circuit's virtually identical definition 
of a "willful violation" as "one involving voluntary action, done 
with either an intentional disregard of, or plain indifference 
to, the requirements of the [OSHA] statute."  Georgia Elec. 
Co. v. Marshall, 595 F.2d 309, 319 (5th Cir. 1979).  Under 
either definition, actual malice is not required;  it is sufficient 
that there be substantial evidence of voluntary and intentional 
disregard for or indifference to the law.  See Conie, 73 F.3d 
at 384;  Georgia Elec., 595 F.2d at 318-19.  Consistent with 
our standard of review, see National Eng'g & Contracting Co. 
v. OSHRC, 45 F.3d 476, 481 (D.C. Cir. 1995), we conclude that 
there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's 
finding of willfulness.

     Contrary to Kaspar Wire's position, the fact that the same 
recordkeeping personnel who had been trained by OSHA 
staff were still in charge in 1988 and 1989 actually supports 
the Commission's conclusion that Kaspar Wire knowingly and 
voluntarily chose to flout the recordkeeping requirements.  
That is, Kaspar Wire could have no doubt about what the 
regulations required.  Kaspar Wire points to testimony by 
one OSHA inspector that inspections conducted between 1982 
and 1989 indicated that Kaspar Wire was complying with 
OSHA's recordkeeping requirements, and that if Kaspar 
Wire's recordkeeping practices remained unchanged it could 
reasonably assume in March 1990 that its practices con-
formed to OSHA standards.  Another inspector testified that 
in his view Kaspar Wire's recordkeeping practices had not 
changed over time.  However, "the Commission is not bound 
by the representations or interpretations of OSHA Compli-
ance Officers."  L.R. Willson & Sons, Inc. v. Donovan, 685 
F.2d 664, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  Further, two other OSHA 
inspectors testified that based on the 1990 inspection, Kaspar 
Wire had clearly and intentionally violated the recordkeeping 
requirements of the statute, see 29 U.S.C. s 657(c)(1), and 
that the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics 
had independently confirmed that all of the injuries in ques-
tion should have been recorded on OSHA form No. 200.

     From this evidence, the Commission could reasonably infer, 
see United States Testing Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 160 F.3d 14, 19 
(D.C. Cir. 1998), that sometime prior to 1988, Kaspar Wire's 
recordkeeping practices underwent a dramatic change that 
was not explainable by changes in the number of persons it 
employed.  As the Commission found, in addition to the sheer 
magnitude of the recordkeeping violations--which the Com-
mission characterized as "far exceed[ing] that of any other 
case decided by the Commission"--the nature of the injuries 
that were unreported belies Kaspar Wire's claim that its 
actions were merely negligent or careless.  The violations at 
issue were not mere technical omissions;  rather, the viola-
tions involved the failure to report injuries as serious as 
finger amputations, broken bones, eye injuries and severe 
burns that resulted in prolonged absences from work.  Kas-

par Wire thus cannot reasonably contend that there was 
confusion about whether injuries of this nature had to be 
reported on form OSHA No. 200 or its equivalent.  Nor can 
Kaspar Wire seriously contend that it was entitled to rely on 
its lack of prior violations to undermine a finding of willful-
ness.  See Cedar Constr. Co. v. OSHRC, 587 F.2d 1303, 1306 
(D.C. Cir. 1978);  cf. Herman v. Palo Group Foster Home, 
Inc., 183 F.3d 468, 473 (6th Cir. 1999);  National Steel and 
Shipbldg. Co. v. OSHRC, 607 F.2d 311, 317 (9th Cir. 1979).  
Otherwise, an employer with no prior citations could choose 
to violate a regulatory obligation without risking a finding of 
willfulness, contrary to common sense and the definition of a 
"willful violation" in the OSHA context.

     Conie is instructive.  In that case, a construction company 
challenged an OSHA citation for the willful violation of a 
regulation governing the slope of a trench that had been 
excavated to install a sewer manhole.  The OSHA compliance 
officer testified that the company foreman acknowledged that 
the walls of the trench did not comply with the sloping 
regulation, but nevertheless opted to ignore the requirement 
because he thought the trench was safe.  The court upheld 
the Commission's finding of willfulness in view of the evidence 
that the company knew of the regulation and intentionally 
chose not to comply with OSHA's excavation requirements.  
See Conie, 73 F.3d at 384;  see also Donovan v. Williams 
Enterprises, Inc., 744 F.2d 170, 179-80 (D.C. Cir. 1984);  
Finer Food Sales Co., Inc. v. Block, 708 F.2d 774, 777-78 
(D.C. Cir. 1983).  Similarly, here the Commission could rea-
sonably find that Kaspar Wire knew of and intentionally 
chose to ignore OSHA recordkeeping regulations, and there-
by jeopardized not only the ability of the Secretary and 
OSHA to carry out their statutory responsibilities, but the 
health and safety of Kaspar Wire's employees.

     Kaspar Wire's attempt to rely on cases cited by the Secre-
tary fails, for they clearly support the Secretary's position.  
For example, although the court concluded in L.R. Willson, 
685 F.2d at 676, that a finding of willfulness with respect to 
an ambiguous safety requirement could not be sustained, this 
result was so only because the employer had not been given 

adequate notice of what was required.  Kaspar Wire makes 
no claim there was ambiguity about what the recordkeeping 
regulations required.  See also Brock v. Morello Bros. 
Constr., Inc., 809 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987);  Williams Enter-
prises, 744 F.2d at 179-80;  Cedar Constr., 587 F.2d at 1306.

     Kaspar Wire protests nonetheless that the Commission's 
finding of willfulness makes no sense because Kaspar Wire 
had nothing to gain by violating the recordkeeping regula-
tions.  All of the incidents not reported on form OSHA No. 
200 were reported on the first aid log.  Also, according to 
Kaspar Wire, the incidence of reported violations for 1988 and 
1989 on the form 200 exceeded the cutoff of 4.3% needed to 
avoid future on-site safety inspections.  These contentions 
ignore two salient points.  First, the Secretary has chosen to 
fulfill her statutory responsibilities by requiring injury re-
porting on form OSHA No. 200.  See 29 U.S.C. 
s 657(c)(1),(c)(2) and (g)(2);  29 C.F.R. s 1904.2(a).  There 
was evidence before the Commission that Kaspar Wire was 
an employer whose records were designed to show a low lost 
workday injury rate that would exempt them from an on-site 
safety inspection.  On three previous occasions, OSHA in-
spections of Kaspar Wire revealed a lost workday injury rate 
that was below the national average, thereby exempting the 
company from a comprehensive safety inspection.  As the 
Secretary states in her brief:

     Kaspar [Wire]'s indifference to recordkeeping require-
     ments and inattention to accurate reporting produced a 
     picture of working conditions that would mislead employ-
     ees and OSHA concerning the true extent of the hazards 
     at Kaspar [Wire].  By obscuring these injuries, Kaspar 
     [Wire] effectively perpetuated the hazards to which its 
     employees were exposed and it disabled an alarm mecha-
     nism which might have alerted employees and OSHA to 
     problem areas in the workplace.
     
Respondent's Brief at 58.

     Second, the Commission's finding of willfulness did not 
require evidence of motive.  As the Supreme Court explained 
in TWA v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 126 n.19 (1985), "an 

employer's action may be 'willful' ... even though he did not 
have an evil motive or bad purpose."  See also Hazen Paper 
Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 617 (1993).  Although to find 
willfulness the Commission had to find that Kaspar Wire's 
conduct involved more than mere negligence or carelessness, 
see McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 133 
(1988), there was substantial evidence of Kaspar Wire's know-
ing and intentional disregard of the recordkeeping require-
ments.  See Conie, 73 F.3d at 384.  The Commission took 
note of both the unprecedented volume of violations and the 
seriousness of the unreported injuries, as well as the abun-
dant evidence of Kaspar Wire's actual knowledge of what was 
required under OSHA regulations based on its own admis-
sions and its past recordkeeping practices.  Essentially, then, 
the Commission was confronted with a record of unabashed 
violations involving serious injuries to employees in the face 
of certain knowledge of what was required.  Congress and 
the Secretary, not Kaspar Wire, have been entrusted with 
determining how best to ensure worker health and safety, 
and given the evidence of Kaspar Wire's egregious flouting of 
regulatory requirements, the Commission's finding of willful-
ness is amply supported by the record.

     Kaspar Wire's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting the Commission's findings that it willfully failed to 
install point-of-operations guards on a punch press, in viola-
tion of 29 C.F.R. s 1910.217(c)(1), and failed to ground porta-
ble lamps, in violation of 29 C.F.R. s 1910.304(f)(5)(V), are 
meritless.  An OSHA inspector photographed the unguarded 
press, and based on the same photograph, an OSHA supervi-
sor determined that a citation was warranted because the 
picture of one employee using the machine indicated that 
multiple employees were probably using the machine.  As to 
the lamps, the evidence was unrebutted that the lamps were 
portable and "clamp" type.  Because the lamps were handled 
roughly and used to illuminate trucks that were being loaded, 
the Commission could reasonably infer that employees were 
exposed to a danger of electric shock.

                               III.

     Kaspar Wire also challenges the lawfulness of the per 
instance penalties on statutory and procedural grounds.  
Contending that the Secretary lacks statutory authority to 
assess per instance penalties for "egregious and willful" viola-
tions, which is not among the four levels of violations set forth 
in the Act, see 29 U.S.C. s 666(a)-(c), Kaspar Wire claims that 
Congress did not authorize per instance penalties.  Kaspar 
Wire relies on a structural argument based on the Coal Mine 
Health & Safety Act of 1969 ("Coal Mine Act"), 30 U.S.C. 
s 801 et seq. (1996), which Congress enacted one year before 
it enacted the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  Kaspar 
Wire further contends that even if the Secretary has authori-
ty to impose per instance penalties, her new policy violates 
the Administrative Procedure Act either because her policy is 
a rule subject to notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. s 553, or 
because her policy was not published in the Federal Register.  
None of these contentions has merit.

     Section 17(a) of the Act provides that "[a]ny employer who 
willfully or repeatedly violates the requirements of ... regu-
lations prescribed ... may be assessed a civil penalty of not 
more than $10,000 for each violation." 29 U.S.C. s 666(a) 
(emphasis added).  The plain language of the Act could 
hardly be clearer.  The Commission has long agreed that per 
instance citations and penalties are allowed.  See Pepperidge 
Farm, Inc., 17 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1993, 2001 (1997);  Sanders 
Lead Co., 17 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1197, 1204-05 (1995);  J.A. 
Jones Constr. Co., 15 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2201, 2213-14 (1993);  
Caterpillar, Inc., 15 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2153, 2173 (1993);  
Hoffman Constr. Co., 6 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1274, 1275 (1978).  
The availability of such penalties is consistent with the gener-
al principle that each violation of a statutory duty exposes the 
violator to a separate statutory penalty.  See, e.g., Missouri, 
Kansas, & Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, 231 U.S. 112, 119 
(1913);  Used Equip. Sales, Inc. v. Dep't of Transp., 54 F.3d 
862, 865 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The statutory language is consis-
tent, moreover, with discretionary per instance assessments 
for "egregious and willful" violations, which the OSHA field 
operations manual defines as "willful, repeated and high 

gravity serious citations and failures to abate."  Caterpillar, 
Inc., 15 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2153, 2170 (1993) (quoting OSHA 
Instruction CPL 2.45A, Field Operations Manual, Ch. VI, 
s A.2.i.(4), at VI-8 (Sept. 21, 1987)).

     Kaspar Wire's reliance on the language of the Coal Mine 
Act is misplaced.  Section 111(a) of the Coal Mine Act (since 
repealed and redesignated as the Federal Mine Safety and 
Health Act of 1977) provides that "[e]ach occurrence of a 
violation of a mandatory health or safety standard may 
constitute a separate offense."  30 U.S.C. s 820(a).  Howev-
er, as the Secretary points out, there is nothing to suggest 
that Congress patterned the Act after the Coal Mine Act.  
The Coal Mine Act employed a significantly different adminis-
trative structure, with rulemaking, enforcement and adjudica-
tory functions concentrated in the Secretary of the Interior.  
See 29 U.S.C. ss 801 et seq. (1976).  Only in 1977 was the 
administrative structure made to conform to the Act's, with 
the vesting of rulemaking and enforcement authority in the 
Secretary of Labor and the establishment of an independent 
review commission for adjudications.  See 30 U.S.C. ss 814-
816, 961(a) (1986).  In any event, Congress is not limited in 
the language it may use across statutes to provide that per 
instance penalties are authorized.  Moreover, even had Con-
gress had not spoken directly to the question of per instance 
penalties, the Secretary's interpretation would be entitled to 
deference given her official duty, specialized expertise, inves-
tigatory knowledge, and other experience relevant to carrying 
out the purposes of the Act.  See United States v. Mead 
Corp., 121 S.Ct. 2164, 2175 (2001) (citing Skidmore v. Swift & 
Co., 323 U.S. 134, 138 (1944));  cf. Anthony Crane Rental, Inc. 
v. Reich, 70 F.3d 1298, 1302 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Martin v. 
OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144, 150-51 (1991));  Used Equip. Sales, 54 
F.3d at 864-65.

     Nor was the imposition of per instance penalties unlawful 
on procedural grounds.  The Secretary's decision to assess 
per instance penalties reflects use of an enforcement tool 
within her authority.  Cf. United Steelworkers of Am. v. 
Herman, 216 F.3d 1095, 1097 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Her decision 
followed a comprehensive review of Kaspar Wire's record-

keeping practices, and its virtual admission that it had not 
complied with the recordkeeping rule.  The Secretary has 
never taken the position that she lacks authority or would 
decline to issue per instance citations to employers who 
commit multiple violations of the same regulatory require-
ment, and in fact has exercised her discretion to propose 
separate penalties for discrete violations over the years.  See, 
e.g., RSR Corp., 11 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1163, 1180-81 (1983);  
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., 10 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1242 
(1981);  Morris-Knudsen & Assoc., 8 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2231, 
2239 (1980);  Hoffman Constr. Co., 6 O.S.H. Cs. (BNA) 1274 
(1978).  Consequently, the line of cases that require rulemak-
ing upon a change of policy are inapplicable.  See, e.g., Nat'l 
Ass'n of Home Health Agencies, v. Schweiker, 690 F.2d 932, 
949 (D.C. Cir. 1982);  cf. Aulenback, Inc. v. Fed. Highway 
Admin., 103 F.3d 156, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing 5 U.S.C. 
s 553).  In addition, there is nothing to Kaspar Wire's con-
tention that per-instance penalties "encode[ ] a substantive 
value judgment or put[ ] a stamp of approval or disapproval 
on a given type of behavior," American Hosp. Ass'n v. 
Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1987), thereby render-
ing the policy ineligible for the procedural rule exemption 
from notice and comment requirements.  See 5 U.S.C. 
s 553(b)(A).  Such reasoning, as JEM Broadcasting Co., Inc. 
v. FCC, 22 F.3d 320 (D.C. Cir. 1994), points out, "threatens to 
swallow the procedural exception to notice and comment, for 
agency housekeeping rules often embody a judgment about 
what mechanics and processes are most efficient."  Id. at 328.  
Kaspar Wire's reliance on the Fifth Circuit's "substantial 
impact" standard for notice and comment requirements, see 
Brown Express, Inc. v. United States, 607 F.2d 695, 702 (5th 
Cir. 1979), is unavailing because this circuit has expressly 
rejected that standard.  See American Postal Workers Un-
ion, AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Serv., 707 F.2d 548, 
560 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  Furthermore, because the statutory 
authorization of per instance penalties is so clear from the 
statutory language, publication in the Federal Register was 
not required.  See Malkam FM Assoc. v. FCC, 935 F.2d 1313, 
1318 (D.C. Cir. 1991);  5 U.S.C. s 552(a)(2).

     Finally, OSHA penalties are meant to "inflict pocket-book 
deterrence."  Atlas Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, 518 F.2d 990, 
1001 (5th Cir. 1975), aff'd, 430 U.S. 442 (1977).  Section 666(j) 
of the Act provides that the Commission is to give "due 
consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with 
respect to the size of the business of the employer charged, 
the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, 
and the history of previous violations."  The Commission 
found that Kaspar Wire is a moderate-to-large sized company 
employing approximately 850 to 900 employees with a history 
of few previous OSHA violations, none of which pertained to 
recordkeeping.  It noted that the gravity of recordkeeping 
violations is generally considered low. It reasonably declined, 
however, to accord good faith credit to Kaspar Wire in light 
of the fact that the bulk of the violations were willful and the 
failures to record were "largely so obvious."  The Commis-
sion affirmed the Administrative Law Judge's per instance 
penalties in the amount of $250-$1000 per item, and upon 
deducting $17,000 for various vacated items, affirmed an 
aggregate penalty of $210,500 for willful recordkeeping viola-
tions.  The Commission also affirmed an aggregate penalty of 
$4,875 for non-serious restricted workday recording violations 
based on the change in characterization.  Kaspar Wire does 
not contend that the Commission failed to give due consider-
ation to these penalty criteria, nor (apart from its objection to 
the Secretary's authority to impose per-instance penalties) 
does it claim that the specific penalty amounts assessed for 
each violation were excessive.

     Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.
