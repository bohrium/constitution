     Before:  Williams, Sentelle and Henderson, Circuit 
Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  In 1997 the Department of Ener-
gy ("DOE") contracted to decontaminate and decommission 
three buildings at its nuclear weapons facility in Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee.  The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Interna-
tional Union, AFL-CIO ("OCAW"), a labor union whose 
members work at this facility, brought suit seeking to enjoin 
execution of the contract.  (Also suing were several of the 
union's individual members, who will henceforth be disregard-
ed.)  OCAW's theories are twofold.  First, it claims that DOE 
and its contractors violated s 3161 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, 42 U.S.C. s 7274h, 
which it reads as requiring DOE to provide its members 
continued employment and employment benefits after the 
implementation of a major workforce restructuring.  Second, 
it argues that under s 102(2)(c) of the National Environmen-
tal Policy Act ("NEPA"), 42 U.S.C. s 4332(2)(C) the recycling 
and sale of recovered metals from the project cannot proceed 
unless an environmental impact statement is first prepared.  
The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss on 
the first claim, Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 
AFL-CIO v. PeNa, 18 F. Supp.2d 6, 16 (D.D.C. 1998) ("OCAW 
I"), and their motion for summary judgment on the second.  
Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. 
PeNa, 62 F. Supp.2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 1999) ("OCAW II").

     On the s 3161 claim, OCAW made clear at oral argument 
that its sole current claim is that DOE failed to enforce the 
labor provisions of its contracts.  Because nothing in the 
statute provides a meaningful standard against which to 
judge any such agency nonenforcement, we find the claim 

barred by the preclusion of review in 5 U.S.C. s 701(a)(2).  
See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985).  As to the NEPA 
claim, s 113(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980  
("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. s 9613(h), withholds federal court 
jurisdiction (subject to irrelevant exceptions) over any "chal-
lenges to removal or remedial action selected under section 
[104] of this title."  Because the recycling activity provided 
for in the contracts clearly qualifies as such a "removal" 
action, we have no jurisdiction over the NEPA claim.  Ac-
cordingly, we affirm.

                              * * *

     For many years the Oak Ridge Reservation was used to 
enrich uranium for nuclear weapons and nuclear power gen-
eration.  In 1989 EPA placed it on the National Priority List 
of contaminated sites.  OCAW II, 62 F. Supp.2d at 2.  Later, 
acting under CERCLA s 120, 42 U.S.C. s 9620, EPA, DOE, 
and the Tennessee Department of Education and Conserva-
tion entered into a Federal Facilities Agreement ("FFA") for 
Oak Ridge, thereby scheduling the facility "for decontamina-
tion and decommissioning, waste management, and environ-
mental remediation."  In March 1997 they amended the FFA 
to include a schedule for the cleanup of three buildings at Oak 
Ridge's K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant, the cleanup in dispute 
here.  In August 1997 DOE awarded a contract to British 
Nuclear Fuels, Inc. ("BNFL") to remove the equipment and 
decontaminate the buildings.  We turn first to the s 3161 
issue, then to NEPA.

     After determining that a large reduction in workforce 
would result from closing the facility, DOE undertook work-
force restructuring efforts.  Section 3161 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, 42 U.S.C. 
s 7274h, requires that when "a change in the workforce at a 
defense nuclear facility is necessary, the Secretary of Energy 
... shall develop a plan for restructuring the workforce for 
the defense nuclear facility."  DOE's initial workforce re-
structuring plan ("WRP"), which was finalized on November 
29, 1995, mimicked s 3161's stated objectives.  It said, for 

instance, that hiring preferences would be provided to eligible 
employees "to the extent practicable."  Oak Ridge Operations 
Work Force Restructuring Plan, at 5-1 (November 29, 1995).  
The WRP also provided for medical benefits, outplacement 
assistance, relocation assistance, training programs, and edu-
cation assistance.  Id. at 4-1 to 5-2.

     The contract with BNFL effectively delegated to it the 
fulfillment of the WRP's mandates.  DOE/BNFL Contract, at 
H-9 to H-10.  BNFL then negotiated a Project Labor 
Agreement ("PLA") with Knoxville Building and Construction 
Trades Council, AFL-CIO ("Building Trades"), to address 
how the construction workers for the project would be hired.  
The PLA incorporated the hiring preference embodied in the 
WRP:  "[T]he Union shall recognize and select qualified appli-
cants for referral in accordance with Section 3161 ... and/or 
the Employer's contractual obligation to [DOE] relating to 
3161."  Project Agreement Between BNFL Inc. and Building 
Trades (August 7, 1997), at 6.

     We agree with the district court that review of the s 3161 
claim is barred by s 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Proce-
dure Act ("APA").  (As such preclusion is jurisdictional, 
Claybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1997), we 
may affirm dismissal of the claim without reaching the other 
jurisdictional defenses--such as DOE's mootness contention.  
See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 584-85, 
119 S. Ct. 1563, 1570 (1999).)  APA judicial review is unavail-
able "to the extent that--(1) statutes preclude judicial review;  
or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by 
law."  5 U.S.C. s 701(a).  Agency action falls within 
s 701(a)(2) when "the statute is drawn so that a court would 
have no meaningful standard against which to judge the 
agency's exercise of discretion."  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 
821, 830 (1985).  Here, the statute says that "the Secretary 
shall be guided by the following objectives," 42 U.S.C. 
s 7274h(c), which include providing terminated employees 
with hiring preferences "to the extent practicable," id.  Not-
ing that these provisions gave the Secretary "enormous dis-

cretion," the district court held that s 3161 fell within Cha-
ney's bar.  OCAW I, 18 F. Supp.2d at 15-16.

     In view of OCAW's present exclusive focus on enforcement 
of the BNFL contract, we need not finally resolve whether 
for every context the statute's language reaches Chaney 
levels of discretion.  Section 3161 requires the Secretary of 
Energy to "develop a plan for restructuring the workforce," 
and the Secretary did so through the WRP, which incorporat-
ed the further mandates of s 3161.  DOE then delegated the 
statutory requirements in its contract with BNFL, which 
were in turn subdelegated in part to Building Trades.  Be-
cause DOE satisfied its requirement to develop a plan, 
OCAW can now complain only of inadequate contract enforce-
ment.  It thereby brings its cause squarely within Heckler v. 
Chaney's presumption of unreviewability for enforcement de-
cisions:  "[A]n agency's decision not to prosecute or enforce, 
whether through civil or criminal process, is a decision gener-
ally committed to an agency's absolute discretion."  470 U.S. 
at 831.  The Court justified this presumption on several 
grounds.  First, the agency has expertise in assessing wheth-
er a violation has occurred and whether it is a valuable use of 
the agency's resources to commence enforcement proceed-
ings.  Second, "when an agency refuses to act it generally 
does not exercise its coercive power over an individual's 
liberty or property rights, and thus does not infringe upon 
areas that courts are often called upon to protect."  Id. at 
832.

     Although Chaney did not explicitly address contract en-
forcement, it seems indistinguishable from civil enforcement 
activities in the dimensions relevant to Chaney;  certainly 
OCAW offers no distinctions.  Nor does the statute contain 
any guidance on the Secretary's exercise of enforcement 
power, such as might rebut the presumption.  See id. at 833.  
Nor, finally, can we find any such limits in DOE's Notice of 
Interim Planning Guidance, Planning Guidance for Contrac-
tor Work Force Restructuring, 61 Fed. Reg. 8593, 8595/2, 
8599/2 (1996), to which OCAW points in a search for the 
needed non-discretionary backbone.  Of course our decision 
here says nothing about the possible ability of plaintiffs to sue 
as third-party beneficiaries of the BNFL contract or the 
PLA.

     We thus turn to the NEPA claim.  CERCLA s 113(h), 42 
U.S.C. s 9613(h), says that "[n]o Federal court shall have 
jurisdiction under Federal law ... to review any challenges 
to removal or remedial action selected under section [104] of 
this title, or to review any order issued under section [106] of 
this title."  Although s 113(h) is subject to limited excep-
tions--e.g., for recovery of "response costs or damages or for 
contribution," 42 U.S.C. s 9613(h)(1), and for reimbursement 
of costs in response to a remedial order that was arbitrary 
and capricious, id. s 9613(h)(3)--it otherwise effectuates a 
"blunt withdrawal of federal jurisdiction," North Shore Gas 
Co. v. EPA, 930 F.2d 1239, 1244 (7th Cir. 1991), despite its 
more limited rationale "that pre-enforcement review would be 
a significant obstacle to the implementation of response ac-
tions and the use of administrative orders."  S. Rep. No. 11, 
99th Cong. 1, 58 (1985).

     The government here says that the cleanup plan constitutes 
a "removal" action as the term is used in s 113(h).  This is 
defined in 42 U.S.C. s 9601(23) as:

     the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances 
     from the environment, such actions as may be necessary 
     [sic] taken in the event of the threat of release of 
     hazardous substances into the environment, ... the dis-
     posal of removed material, or the taking of such other 
     actions as may be necessary to prevent, minimize, or 
     mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the 
     environment....
     
     OCAW correctly points out that recycling is not explicitly 
mentioned here, though it is in the definition of "remedial 
action."  42 U.S.C. s 9601(24).  But we agree with the dis-
trict court that the broader language of s 9601(23), "disposal 
of removed material," is properly understood to encompass 
disposals that take the form of recycling.  OCAW II, 62 
F. Supp.2d at 6 n.5.  Moreover, because "remedial actions" 
are also protected by s 113(h), OCAW's argument would 
prove pointless here, unless, for some unmentioned reason, 
DOE's having said "removal" when it should have said "reme-
dial action" were fatal to its invocation of s 113(h).

     OCAW challenges the applicability of s 113(h) on the basis 
that this recycling is not within the scope of DOE's "removal 

action," largely because the decision to recycle is left to the 
sole discretion of BNFL.  Relying on the language of DOE's 
Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (comparing the alter-
natives for addressing contamination at the K-25 facility), 
however, the district court found that despite the allowance of 
discretion, DOE and BNFL expressed a strong preference 
for recycling.  Because recycling was the "primary method of 
waste disposal" contemplated by the parties, it was part of 
the "removal action" for purposes of s 113(h).  OCAW II, 62 
F. Supp.2d at 6.  Moreover, other documents "mad[e] abun-
dantly clear that BNFL is absolutely required to dispose of 
all waste whether by recycling or otherwise," id. at 7, and 
such other "disposal of removed material" is explicitly within 
the definition of a removal action.  See 42 U.S.C. s 9601(23).

     The second argument alone is decisive.  As both options 
under the plan qualified as actions sheltered by s 113(h), the 
case requires no theorizing as to whether the section might 
apply to a non-sheltered practice that was somehow part of 
an action otherwise protected by s 113(h).  OCAW's claims 
here are insubstantial.

     The judgment of the district court is

                                                        Affirmed.
