     Concurring opinion filed by Circuit Judge Rogers

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  On August 13, 
1998 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) proposed revised "Safety Standards for Steel Erec-
tion" based on a consensus document submitted by a rule-
making advisory committee in a negotiated rulemaking.  63 
Fed. Reg. 43,452 (1998).  After a public hearing, two com-
ment periods and a public consultation meeting, OSHA issued 
its final rule on January 18, 2001.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 5196 
(2001).  The Steel Joist Institute (Institute) asks the court to 
invalidate three provisions of the final rule's safety standard 
for open web steel joists.  The three provisions are codified at 
29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(1)(iii), 29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(3) and 
29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(8).  Because the Institute presented 
argument against section 1926.757(a)(3) for the first time in 
its reply brief, its challenge to this provision is waived.  See 
Benkelman Telephone Co. v. FCC, 220 F.3d 601, 607 n.10 
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (argument found "waived because ... raised 
for the first time in the petitioners' reply brief") (citing Grant 
v. United States Air Force, 197 F.3d 539, 543 (D.C. Cir. 1999) 
(citing Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 173 F.3d 
898, 902-03 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).  As explained below, we reject 
the Institute's objections to section 1926.757(a)(1)(iii) and 
section 1926.757(a)(8), which require "field bolting" of steel 
joists, because they are authorized by section 6(b) of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 
s 655(b), (Act) and they are supported by substantial evi-
dence.

     Each of the two challenged provisions requires that joists 
be field bolted temporarily during steel erection to protect 
employees working on and around the joists until the joists 
are welded permanently in place.  Specifically, they provide:

          (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
     section,[1] where steel joists are used and columns are not 
     framed in at least two directions with solid web structur-
     al steel members, a steel joist shall be field-bolted at the 
     column to provide lateral stability to the column during 
     erection. For the installation of this joist:
           ... 
          
          (iii) Hoisting cables shall not be released until the seat 
          at each end of the steel joist is field-bolted, and each 
          end of the bottom chord is restrained by the column 
          stabilizer plate.
     ... 
     
          (8) Field-bolted joists.
     
          (i) Except for steel joists that have been pre-
          assembled into panels, connections of individual steel 
          joists to steel structures in bays of 40 feet (12.2 m) or 
          more shall be fabricated to allow for field bolting 
          during erection.
          
          (ii) These connections shall be field-bolted unless con-
          structibility does not allow.
          
29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(1)(iii), (a)(8) (footnote added).  The 
Institute challenges the provisions on two grounds.

     First, the Institute contends that the provisions constitute 
an ultra vires attempt to regulate joist design and conse-
quently the off-site joist manufacturers.  We disagree.  It is 
true that the Act authorizes OSHA to regulate only the 
employer's conduct at the worksite.  See 29 U.S.C. s 653(a) 
("This chapter shall apply with respect to employment per-
formed in a workplace....");  cf. Frank Diehl Farms v. 
Secretary of Labor, 696 F.2d 1325, 1332 (11th Cir. 1983) 
__________
     1 Section (a)(2) authorizes an "alternate means of stabilizing 
joists" to be used "[w]here constructibility does not allow a steel 
joist to be installed at the column."  29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(2).

(s 653(a) does not authorize OSHA to regulate migrant work-
er's living conditions);  but the challenged provisions do not 
exceed OSHA's statutory authority. Notwithstanding the in-
felicitous phrasing of section 1926.757(a)(8), which purports to 
direct how joists "shall be fabricated," OSHA has made it 
clear that the challenged provisions are not enforceable, or 
intended to be enforced, against joist manufacturers.2  Regu-
lation 1926.750 expressly declares that "[t]his subpart sets 
forth requirements to protect employees from the hazards 
associated with steel erection activities," 29 C.F.R. 
s 1926.750(a) (emphasis added), and includes several exam-
ples of what constitutes such activities, see id. 
s 1926.750(b)(1) ("Steel erection activities include hoisting, 
laying out, placing, connecting, welding, burning, guying, 
bracing, bolting, plumbing and rigging structural steel, steel 
joists and metal buildings;  installing metal decking, curtain 
walls, window walls, siding systems, miscellaneous metals, 
ornamental iron and similar materials;  and moving point-to-
point while performing these activities.");  see also id. 
s 1926.750(b)(2) (enumerating "activities [that] are covered 
by [the] subpart when they occur during and are a part of 
steel erection activities").  Further, the final rule carefully 
limns the scope of the standard, 66 Fed. Reg. at 5200-02, 
expressly stating that employers in "the fabricated structural 
metal industry ..., which produces iron and steel for struc-
tural purposes such as the construction of bridges and build-
ings, ... are not affected employers under the ... Act," id. 
at 5261 (emphasis added).  See also 29 C.F.R. s 5.2(i) (defin-
ing "building or work generally [to] include construction 
activity as distinguished from manufacturing, furnishing of 
materials, or servicing and maintenance work");  29 C.F.R. 
s 1910.12 (safety standards "shall apply, according to the 
provisions thereof, to every employment and place of employ-
ment of every employee engaged in construction work" and 

__________
     2 OSHA could have accomplished the same result (without the 
objectionable language) had it promulgated only subsection 
(a)(8)(ii), changing "[t]hese connections" to "connections of individu-
al steel joists to steel structures in bays of 40 feet (12.2 m) or 
more."

defining "construction work" as "work for construction, alter-
ation, and/or repair, including painting and decorating").  In-
sofar as the challenged provisions regulate the design of the 
joists used by the steel joist erector, OSHA's authority to 
regulate the safety characteristics of tools and materials used 
at a worksite is well established.  See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. 
s 1926.1053 (setting requirements for worksite ladders);  id. 
s 1926.550 (setting requirements for worksite cranes and 
derricks);  Alabama Power Co. v. OSHA, 89 F.3d 740 (11th 
Cir. 1996) (upholding standard provision "address[ing] cloth-
ing requirements for those employees who may be exposed to 
the hazards of flames or electric arcs").  We therefore reject 
the Institute's ultra vires argument.

     Next, the Institute asserts that neither section 
1926.757(a)(1)(iii) nor section 1926.757(a)(8) is supported by 
substantial record evidence.  See 29 U.S.C. s 655(f) ("The 
determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if sup-
ported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a 
whole.").3  We disagree with this contention as well.  OSHA 
acknowledges, as the Institute asserts, that there is no record 
evidence of injury or death attributable to joist instability.  
See 66 Fed. Reg. at 5232 ("OSHA's accident data do not cast 
any light on whether welding of joist ends is a hazard.").  
OSHA responds, however, that the "data in many cases do 
not provide enough detail as to the role of welding in the 
reported accidents involving joists," id., and further notes, 
correctly, that the Act does not require specific evidence of 

__________
     3 The objection here to section 1926.757(a)(1)(iii) is surprising 
because below the Institute expressly approved subsection (a)(1) 
generally as a required safety measure:  "The requirement for joist 
and girders at columns to be field-bolted is a carryover from the 
previous standard and has long been an effective method for 
preventing adjacent parallel beams from opening up.  Providing a 
bolted connection for joists at columns is a very necessary safety 
issue and has been supported by the joist industry for years."  
Steel Joist Institute Comments on Proposed Rule for Safety Stan-
dards for Steel Erection, Docket No. S-775 (filed Nov. 12, 1998) at 
28.  The Institute's comments did not single out subsection 
(a)(1)(iii) for objection or revision.

past injury to justify standards to prevent future injury from 
a likely hazard.  See Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 
12 (1980) ("[T]he legislation's remedial orientation is prophy-
lactic in nature.  The Act does not wait for an employee to die 
or become injured.  It authorizes the promulgation of health 
and safety standards and the issuance of citations in the hope 
that these will act to prevent deaths or injuries from ever 
occurring.") (citations omitted).  As OSHA points out, unat-
tached joists constitute such a hazard because they can be 
displaced "by wind or construction activity, by the movement 
of employees, by trailing welding leads, by accidental impact 
against the supporting structure by a crane or other equip-
ment, or by harmonic motion, or vibration."  66 Fed. Reg. at 
5236.

     Ultimately the Institute does not deny that unsecured joists 
pose a hazard and has in fact proposed, in order to obviate it, 
that joists be temporarily "tack welded" in place until a 
permanent weld is applied.  See 66 Fed. Reg. at 5233 ("OSHA 
notes, however, that the Steel Joist Institute Technical Digest 
No. 9 currently recommends that 'Immediately after each 
subsequent joist is set in its proper position, one side of the 
joist bearing seat on each end of the joist should be tack 
welded.' ").  The Institute maintains that tack welding is 
safer than bolting because bolting subjects a worker to the 
hazard of an unstable joist twice, once when he bolts it 
initially and again when he permanently welds it.  As OSHA 
pointed out below, however, tack welding likewise requires 
two separate trips, one for the temporary tack weld and a 
second for the permanent weld.  See 66 Fed. Reg. at 5233.  
Further, OSHA offers two persuasive reasons why bolting is 
preferable to tack welding, namely that (1) "joists can roll and 
pop welds due to the movement of a worker on the joist or 
the stresses caused by removing the sweep, which could cause 
a collapse" and (2) welding has "unique hazards," including 
"impairment of the vision and balance of an employee work-
ing at elevation while wearing a welding hood."  66 Fed. Reg 
at 5232.  The likelihood of these hazards supports the field-
bolting requirements imposed in section 1926.757(a)(1)(iii) and 
section 1926.757(a)(8).

     For the preceding reasons, the petition for review is

                                                                 Denied.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge, concurring:  The Steel Joist Insti-
tute ("Institute") begins its "Statement of the Case" in its 
brief as follows:

          The Steel Joist Institute challenges the portions of the 
     Safety Standards for Steel Erection that mandate the 
     design of steel joints.  The regulations are to be codified 
     at 29 C.F.R. [s] 1926.757(a)(1)(iii) ...;  section 757(a)(3) 
     ...;  and section 757(a)(8) ... (collectively, "the Regula-
     tions").
     
Petitioner's Br. at 1.  In presenting a summary of its argu-
ment, the Institute closely repeats the first sentence of its 
Statement of the Case and adds:

     The regulations should be set aside for two reasons.  
     First, OSHA does not have statutory authority to specify 
     the design of buildings' structural elements.  Second, the 
     regulations are not supported by substantial evidence.
     
Id. at 6.  The Institute then contends that in attempting to 
improve the safety of steel erection, OSHA has "reached back 
to assert its statutory authority over the design of the prod-
uct being assembled by steel erectors" but that "the Act does 
not contemplate OSHA designing steel joists" "because Con-
gress has clearly expressed its intent that OSHA's jurisdic-
tion only extends as far as working conditions at the place of 
employment."  Id.  Finally, the Institute argues that sections 
1926.757(a)(1) and (8) are not supported by substantial evi-
dence in the record.  Id. at 7.

     Accordingly, there is no basis on which the court can 
conclude that the Institute has waived its challenge to 
OSHA's statutory authority to promulgate section 
1926.757(a)(3).  See Opinion at 2.  The Institute raised two 
issues on appeal:  (1) whether OSHA exceeded its authority in 
promulgating provisions of a regulation that in its view dic-
tate the design of steel joists, and (2) whether there is 
substantial evidence in the record to support sections (a)(1) 
and (a)(8) of the regulation.  See id. at xiii.  Because these 
are separately presented issues, there is no basis on which to 
conclude that the Institute waived its general challenge to 

OSHA's statutory authority specifically as to section 
1926.757(a)(3) while preserving the same statutory challenge 
as to sections (a)(1) and (a)(8).

     On the merits, the Institute's challenge to OSHA's authori-
ty to promulgate these three provisions of the regulation is 
meritless.  The court's analysis of OSHA's authority is no less 
applicable to section 1926.757(a)(3) than to sections 
1926.757(a)(1) and (8).  In holding that OSHA did not exceed 
its congressionally delegated authority in promulgating sec-
tions 1926.757(a)(1) and (8), the court makes three relevant 
observations:  (1) OSHA's authority to regulate safety charac-
teristics of tools and materials used at a worksite is well 
established;  (2) the final rule expressly exempts employers in 
the fabricated structural metal industry from the standard;  
and (3) "[n]otwithstanding the infelicitous phrasing of section 
1926.757(a)(8), which purports to direct how joists 'shall be 
fabricated,' OSHA has made it clear that the challenged 
provisions are not enforceable, or intended to be enforced, 
against joist manufacturers."  Opinion at 3-5.  Similar to the 
phraseology of section 1926.757(a)(8), section 1926.757(a)(3) 
provides that "the joist shall be designed with sufficient 
strength," but has as its purpose "to allow one employee to 
release the hoisting cable without the need for erection 
bridging."  29 C.F.R. s 1926.757(a)(3) (emphasis added).  In 
other words, the activity being regulated by OSHA under 
section 1926.757(a)(3) is, again, at the work site, and not in 
the manufacturing facility.  Nor is there any suggestion that 
the language or effect of section 1926.757(a)(3) regarding 
"design[ ]" is different in any material way from section 
1926.757(a)(8)'s statement about "fabricat[ion]."  Under the 
circumstances, there is no basis to hold that OSHA lacked 
authority to promulgate section 1926.757(a)(3) much less sec-
tions 1926.757(a)(1) and (8).

     Accordingly, because there was substantial evidence in the 
record considered as a whole to support sections 
1926.757(a)(1) and (8), see Opinion at 5-6, I concur in denying 
the petition.
