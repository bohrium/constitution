     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Williams and Henderson, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge Edwards.

     Edwards, Chief Judge:  The National Guard Technician Act 
of 1968, 32 U.S.C. s 709(b), provides that, as a condition of 
civilian employment, technicians must, inter alia, be members 
of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified 
by the Secretary concerned.  And s 709(a) of the Technician 
Act, 32 U.S.C. s 709(a), specifies that persons are employed 
as technicians "[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secre-
tary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force."  Pursu-
ant to this statutory authority, the Departments of the Army 
and the Air Force have promulgated regulations prohibiting 
military "grade inversion" in the National Guard.  Under this 
policy, the military grade of a full-time supervisor must equal 
or exceed the military grade of personnel supervised.  The 
grade inversion policy has been clarified to apply to persons 
assigned to Wage Leader positions in the National Guard.

     In this case, the Association of Civilian Technicians, Texas 
Lone Star Chapter 100 ("Texas-ACT"), and the Association 
of Civilian Technicians, Wisconsin Chapter 26 (Army) ("Wis-
consin-ACT") (together, the "Unions"), the recognized collec-
tive bargaining agents for technicians employed by the Texas 
National Guard and the Wisconsin National Guard, submitted 
bargaining proposals that would have allowed for the assign-
ment of technicians to Wage Leader positions without restric-
tion based on the technicians' military grade.  When the 
proposals were found to be nonnegotiable by the Offices of 
the Adjutant General, the Unions filed negotiability appeals 
with the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or 
"Authority").

     The Authority found that the duty to bargain in good faith 
did not extend to the Unions' proposals because National 
Guard technicians may not negotiate over military aspects of 
civilian technician employment.  See Ass'n of Civilian Tech-
nicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100, 55 F.L.R.A. (No. 196) 
1226 (2000), reprinted in Joint Appendix ("J.A.") 10;  Ass'n of 

Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100, 56 
F.L.R.A. (No. 63) 432 (2000) (order denying motion for recon-
sideration), reprinted in J.A. 15.  This conclusion was based 
on the Authority's consideration of three statutory provisions:  
10 U.S.C. s 976(c)(2), which prohibits bargaining with, or on 
behalf of, members of the armed forces, concerning the terms 
or conditions of their service;  s 7117(a)(1) of the Federal 
Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. 
s 7117(a)(1), which prohibits bargaining over matters incon-
sistent with any federal law;  and the aforecited s 709 of the 
Technician Act.  See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas 
Lone Star Chapter 100, 55 F.L.R.A. at 1229.

     We deny the petition for review.  The Unions' proposals 
are outside of the duty to bargain under 5 U.S.C. 
s 7117(a)(1), because they are inconsistent with s 709(b).  
See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians,  Texas Lone Star Chapter 
100, 55 F.L.R.A. at 1229.  The legislative history of s 709(b) 
clearly supports the Authority's conclusion that, in requiring 
civilian technicians to "[h]old the military grade specified by 
the Secretary," s 709(b) directs a civilian technician to occupy 
a military grade equal to or exceeding that of subordinate 
personnel.  See, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Mont. 
Air Chapter, 20 F.L.R.A. (No. 85) 717 (1985), petition for 
review denied, 809 F.3d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Table).  Be-
cause our decision rests principally on s 709, we need not 
reach the Unions' claim that the disputed proposals are 
negotiable subjects because they do not invite bargaining 
over a term or condition of military service in violation of 10 
U.S.C. s 976(c)(2).

                          I. Background

     The Texas and Wisconsin chapters of the Association of 
Civilian Technicians represent technicians employed by the 
Texas National Guard and the Wisconsin National Guard (the 
"Guards").  National Guard technicians are federal civilian 
employees, but they "perform even their civilian tasks 'in a 
distinctly military context, implicating significant military 
concerns.' "  Illinois Nat'l Guard v. FLRA, 854 F.2d 1396, 
1398 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard v. 

FLRA, 677 F.2d 276, 279 (3d Cir. 1982)).  National Guard 
technicians are, thus, considered to be "dual status" employ-
ees.  See 10 U.S.C. s 10216;  32 U.S.C. s 709(b).  As a 
prerequisite for their employment, technicians must be mem-
bers of the National Guard unit in which they are employed, 
maintain the military grade specified for their positions, and 
wear their military uniforms while working.  See 32 U.S.C. 
s 709(b);  see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Schenectady 
Chapter v. FLRA, 230 F.3d 377, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

     On March 31, 1995, the Departments of the Army and the 
Air Force promulgated National Guard Regulation 600-25 
and Air National Guard Instruction 36-102, prescribing the 
Guards' military inversion policy, as follows:

     Military grade inversion within the full-time work force 
     is not permitted.  The grade inversion concept is incon-
     sistent with the nature of the National Guard.  The 
     military grade of the full-time supervisor must equal or 
     exceed the military grade of personnel supervised.  Unit 
     of assignment or service component of the individual 
     does not change this policy.

600-25/ANGI 36-102 at 2-1.a. (Mar. 31, 1995), reprinted in 
J.A. 29, 46.

     Nearly three years later, the Chief of the National Guard 
Bureau for the Departments of the Army and the Air Force 
issued a policy guidance, clarifying that the military grade 
inversion policy applied to Wage Leaders.  See Memorandum 
from Steve Nelson, Director for Human Resources, National 
Guard Bureau, NGB-HRC 690-500 (Jan. 7, 1998), reprinted 
in J.A. 27.  Subsequently, in February 1999, the Wisconsin-
ACT submitted the following bargaining proposal to the 
Wisconsin National Guard:

     A Wage Leader employee shall not, as a condition of 
     employment, be required to hold a military rank which is 
     equal to or exceeds the military ranks of the employees 
     with whom the Wage Leader works.

of Civilian Technicians Chapter 26 Army, to Col. James 
Krueck, Wis. Nat'l Guard-Human Resources (Feb. 2, 1999), 
reprinted in J.A. 21.  One month later, the Texas-ACT 
submitted a similar proposal:

     An employee shall be eligible to apply for, to be selected 
     for, and to be appointed to, a Wage Leader position, or a 
     position that requires work with a Wage Leader, without 
     restriction based on whether the employee's appointment 
     would result in the Wage Leader having a military rank 
     below that of any employee with whom the Wage Leader 
     works.
     
Letter from Ronald Webb, President, Ass'n of Civilian Tech-
nicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100, to Gloria Sassman, 
Labor Relations Specialist, Texas Adjutant General's Dep't 
(Mar. 26, 1999), reprinted in J.A. 51-52.

     The Offices of the Adjutant General found both proposals 
to be nonnegotiable.  See Memorandum from Col. James A. 
Krueck, Director, Wis. Nat'l Guard-Human Resources (Feb. 
17, 1999), reprinted in J.A. 20;  Letter from James D. Bishop, 
Labor Relations Specialist, Texas Adjutant General's Dep't, 
to Ronald Webb, President, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, 
Texas Lone Star Chapter 100 (Apr. 27, 1999), reprinted in 
J.A. 53.  The Unions then filed negotiability appeals with the 
Authority.

     On January 14, 2000, the Authority issued a Decision and 
Order dismissing the appeals.  The Unions moved for recon-
sideration, and on June 7, 2000, the Authority denied the 
motion for reconsideration.  The Unions then filed this peti-
tion for review.

                           II. Analysis

A.   Standard of review

     Our review of an Authority negotiability determination is 
generally narrow.  Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, 

144 F.3d 85, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Overseas Educ. Ass'n, Inc. 
v. FLRA, 858 F.2d 769, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  The Federal 
Service Labor-Management Relations Statute entrusts the 
Authority with "resolv[ing] issues relating to the duty to 
bargain in good faith."  5 U.S.C. s 7105(a)(2)(E).  Review of 
a final order of the Authority incorporates s 706 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U.S.C. s 7123(c).  
Thus, when acting "within its authority" and "consistent with 
the congressional mandate," the Authority's decision may 
only be set aside if it is found to be "arbitrary, capricious, an 
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."  
5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A);  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-
arms v. FLRA, 464 U.S. 89, 97 & n.7, 98 n.8 (1983).

     When the Authority's decision does not " 'derive[ ] primari-
ly' from its interpretation of part of its enabling statute," 
however, and when it construes statutes that it does not 
administer, "its interpretation is not entitled to deference."  
Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA, 837 F.2d 1163, 1167 & n.5 (D.C. 
Cir. 1988);  see also Illinois Nat'l Guard, 854 F.3d at 1400.  
In the instant case, the Authority's decision rests, in part, on 
its interpretation of 10 U.S.C. s 976 and 32 U.S.C. s 709, 
legislative enactments that are not part of its enabling stat-
ute.  "We therefore accord the FLRA's construction of these 
statutory provisions no deference, although we shall, of 
course, follow its reasoning to the extent that we deem it 
sound."  Dep't of Treasury, 837 F.2d at 1167.

B.   The proposals at issue are outside of the duty to 
     bargain

     Section 7117(a)(1) of Title 5 specifies that the duty to 
bargain in good faith extends to matters "not inconsistent 
with any Federal law."  5 U.S.C. s 7117(a)(1).  The FLRA 
found that the Unions' proposals are inconsistent with 
s 709(b) of the Technician Act, 32 U.S.C. s 709(b).  We 
agree.

     Subsections 709(b)(2) and (3) of the Technician Act state 
that National Guard technicians must be members of the 
National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the 
Secretary concerned for that position, that is, the military 
grade specified by the Secretary of the Army or the Secre-

tary of the Air Force.  These two subsections were contained 
in s 202 of H.R. 2, a bill proposed "to strengthen the Reserve 
components of the Armed Forces, and clarify the status of 
National Guard technicians," as originally introduced.  H.R. 
Rep. No. 90-13, at 1, 101-02 (1967).  In Title II, which 
addressed the status of National Guard technicians, the bill as 
reported amended clause (b) of s 709 as follows:

     Except as prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a 
     technician employed under subsection (a) shall, while so 
     employed, be a member of the National Guard and hold 
     the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned 
     for that position.
     
Id. at 101-02.  In the Report accompanying the original bill, 
the Committee on Armed Services observed that "[c]lause (b) 
convert[ed] to a statutory requirement" that which had long 
been the practice of the Secretary concerned, namely "to 
designate certain positions as 'officer positions,' others as 
'enlisted positions,' which [could] be filled only by individuals 
who hold the appropriate grade in the National Guard."  Id. 
at 58.  The Committee recognized the "high correlation be-
tween the duties of the technician in his military and civilian 
capacities," and concluded that,

     [i]n the interest of efficiency and discipline, a military 
     commander should not be a civilian subordinate of a 
     member of his unit.  Such inversions may be prevented 
     by authorizing the Secretary concerned to establish the 
     military grade required for employment in a particular 
     technician position.  Proposed 32 U.S.C. s 709(b) of the 
     bill would so provide.
     
Id. at 58-59 (emphasis added).

     In the Fall of 1967, the Committee on Armed Services, 
considering H.R. 2, agreed to defer action on the section 
addressing the status of National Guard technicians until the 
second session of the 90th Congress.  Senate Comm. on 
Armed Services, 90th Cong. 1967-68 Legislative Calendar, at 
25 (July 22, 1968).  During the second session, the Committee 
reported S. 3865, the National Guard Technician Act of 1968.  

S. Rep. No. 90-1446 (1968).  As with Title II of H.R. 2, a 
purpose of the bill was to clarify the technicians' legal status.  
Id. at 1.  Important for present purposes, s 709 clause (b) of 
S. 3865 was identical to that contained in H.R. 2.  Id. at 40-
41.  The Report accompanying S. 3865 expressed the firm 
view that "technicians who are required to be military mem-
bers of the National Guard should occupy a military position 
which is compatible with their civilian technician position."  
Id. at 20.

     The legislative history underlying s 709(b) underscores 
three points.  First, Congress found compatibility require-
ments to be essential to military "efficiency and discipline."  
Second, Congress intended to maintain the long-time practice 
of the Secretary "to designate certain positions" to "be filled 
only by individuals who hold the appropriate grade in the 
National Guard."  Third, in requiring National Guard techni-
cians to "[h]old the military grade specified by the Secretary 
concerned," s 709(b) aims, inter alia, to preserve the "high 
correlation between the duties of the technician in his military 
and civilian capacities."  Because the Unions' proposals are at 
odds with these purposes, they are "inconsistent with [a] 
Federal law" and, consequently, outside the duty to bargain 
under s 7117(a)(1).  See, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, 
Mont. Air Chapter, 20 F.L.R.A. at 723-27 (examining legisla-
tive history of s 709 and reaching same result).

     In short, under the Technician Act, it is clear that a 
National Guard technician "must" "hold the military grade 
specified by the Secretary concerned for that position," and 
that this requirement includes holding a grade that is consis-
tent with the military grade inversion policy.  It also appears 
undisputed that the Departments of the Army and the Air 
Force, implementing the decision of the Secretaries, specified 
that there could be no grade inversion in technician Wage 
Leader positions.  The Authority was therefore fully warrant-
ed in finding that the Unions' proposals were nonnegotiable 
under s 7117(a)(1).

     The Unions point out that the Authority did not find that 
s 709(b) grants the agency unfettered discretion to determine 

military grades.  See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas 
Lone Star Chapter 100, 56 F.L.R.A. at 434 n.4.  They assert, 
additionally, that because statutes granting agencies discre-
tion, but not unfettered discretion, are not bars to negotiation, 
see, e.g., Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Admin. Med. 
Ctr., Veterans Canteen Serv., 44 F.L.R.A. (No. 16) 162, 163-
65 (1992), their proposals are not prohibited by s 709.  This 
argument misses the point.

     Bargaining over the military grade inversion policy is in-
consistent with a federal law. That, by itself, makes the 
proposals nonnegotiable.  The Authority made this absolutely 
clear when it held that, with regard to a matter that might 
otherwise be negotiable as a "condition of employment," 
"bargaining will nevertheless be foreclosed if a proposal is 
inconsistent with law."  Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas 
Lone Star Chapter 100, 55 F.L.R.A. at 1229, reprinted in J.A. 
13.  Further, in its order denying the motion for reconsidera-
tion, the Authority emphasized that the Unions' proposals are 
"outside the duty to bargain without regard to whether they 
are ... within the sole discretion of an agency."  Ass'n of 
Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100, 56 
F.L.R.A. at 434, reprinted in J.A. 17 (emphasis and ellipsis in 
original).  We can find no fault with these holdings.

     The Unions contend that the Authority's decision goes too 
far in suggesting that any proposal affecting the "military 
aspects of technician employment" is outside of the duty to 
bargain.  There is merit in this contention, but we need not 
address the issue.  The Authority is correct that the disputed 
Union proposals are "inconsistent with law" and, therefore, 
beyond the bounds of permissible bargaining.  We deny the 
petition for review on this ground alone.

                         III. Conclusion

     The petition for review is hereby denied.

                                                                  So ordered.
