     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Concurring opinion filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  In April 1997, while serving a 
sentence for drug-related convictions, Robert Johnson filed a 
motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 2255 to vacate his sentence on 
the ground that he had received ineffective assistance of 
counsel at sentencing.  The district court denied the motion 
in July 1998.  Eleven months later, Johnson asked the court 
to reopen the time for filing an appeal from that denial 
because he had only recently received notice of the court's 
decision.  The district court rejected Johnson's request to 
reopen on the ground that it came too late.  We conclude that 
because the district court's initial decision failed to comply 
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, Johnson's time for 
filing an appeal has not yet begun to run.  Accordingly, his 
motion to reopen was unnecessary, and we remand the case 
to the district court for further proceedings.

                                I

     The docket in this case contains twelve pages, issued by the 
district court, that reflect the court's denial of Johnson's 
motion to vacate his sentence.  All twelve pages are stapled 
together.  The first page is entitled "Memorandum and Or-
der" and bears a dated file stamp affixed by the clerk of the 
district court.  The first eleven pages set forth the court's 
legal analysis, rejecting Johnson's claim that his trial counsel 
was ineffective.  The eleventh page concludes by stating:  "An 
appropriate order follows."  The eleventh page is not signed, 
nor does it have a signature line.

     The twelfth page, which is neither file-stamped nor num-
bered, is entitled "Order." It reads, in its entirety, as follows:

     AND NOW, TO WIT, this 10th day of July, 1998, upon 
     consideration of Robert Johnson's motion to vacate, set 
     aside or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. s 2255, IT 
     IS ORDERED that said motion is DENIED without an 
     evidentiary hearing.
     
A signature line with the signature of the district judge 
appears at the bottom.

     All twelve pages were filed on July 16, 1998 and were 
entered on the district court's docket as a single entry, which 
reads as follows:

     MEMORANDUM AND ORDER by Judge Louis C. 
     Bechtle as to ROBERT JOHNSON:  denied without 
     evidentiary hearing motion to vacate, set aside or correct 
     sentence pursuant to 28 USC 2255, referencing count(s) 
     2rs, 3rs (Civil Case No. 97-816 [).]
     
Johnson states that he was not notified when the court issued 
the Memorandum and Order.  Johnson Mot. to Reopen at 2.  
On April 19, 1999, Johnson sent a letter to the district court, 
seeking disposition of his s 2255 motion and abandoning an 
earlier request to supplement the record with additional 
information.  In May 1999, the Clerk of the Court sent 
Johnson a copy of the docket sheet, reflecting the fact that his 
s 2255 motion had already been denied.

     In June 1999, Johnson filed a "Motion to Reopen and or 
Reissue Judgment," which the district court treated as a 
motion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.  The court 
denied the motion on August 4, 1999.  The court noted that 
under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure ("FRAP") 
4(a)(1)(B), a prisoner has sixty days from the entry of judg-
ment to file an appeal from the denial of a s 2255 motion.  
Construing July 16, 1998, the day on which its order denying 
the s 2255 motion was filed, as the trigger date, the court 
found that the time to appeal had expired.  The district court 
then went on to consider whether it could reopen the time to 
appeal pursuant to FRAP 4(a)(6).  That rule permits a dis-

trict court to grant a party's motion to reopen if:  "(A) the 
motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is 
entered ...;  (B) the court finds that the moving party ... 
did not receive the notice [of entry of the judgment or order] 
... within 21 days after entry;  and (C) the court finds that 
no party would be prejudiced."  The district court denied 
Johnson's motion to reopen on the ground that Johnson had 
filed it more than 180 days after the court denied his s 2255 
motion on July 16, 1998.1

     Johnson appealed from the denial of his motion to reopen.  
This court appointed an amicus curiae and requested briefing 
on two questions of federal procedure:  (1) whether Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 58 ("Rule 58"), which requires that a 
judgment be set forth in a separate document, applies to 
s 2255 proceedings;  and (2) if Rule 58 does apply, whether 
the district court's order denying Johnson's s 2255 motion 
satisfies that rule.  We address each of these questions below.

                                II

     Whether the separate document requirement of Rule 58 
applies in appeals from s 2255 proceedings is an issue not yet 
decided by this circuit.  Both Johnson and the government 
believe that it does apply, and we agree.2  That conclusion 

__________
     1  FRAP 4(a)(6)(A) requires a party to file its motion to reopen 
within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered, "or within 7 
days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever 
is earlier."  In addition to holding that Johnson missed the 180-day 
deadline, the district court held that he failed to file his motion 
within seven days of receiving notice of entry from the Clerk of the 
Court.  Although the parties do not agree as to when Johnson 
received notice and when he filed his motion, we need not resolve 
that dispute because the district court's July 16, 1998 decision was 
not entered in compliance with Rule 58.  See infra Part III.

     2  The government has consistently taken the position that Rule 
58 applies to s 2255 proceedings.  See United States v. Saro, No. 
00-3005, 2001 WL 640649, at *5 n.2 (D.C. Cir. June 12, 2001);  
United States v. Feuver, 236 F.3d 725, 727 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2001).

follows from a straightforward reading of the applicable rules.  
We begin with Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 
Proceedings for the United States District Courts ("Rule 11"), 
which states that "[t]he time for appeal from an order entered 
on a [s 2255 motion] is as provided in Rule 4(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure." Rule 11, 28 U.S.C. 
foll. s 2255.  Turning to FRAP 4(a), we learn that a notice of 
appeal (when the United States is a party) must be filed 
within sixty days "after the judgment or order appealed from 
is entered."  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Similarly, a motion to 
reopen the time to appeal must be filed within 180 days "after 
the judgment or order is entered."  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A).  
Finally, and most important here, FRAP 4(a)(7) states that a 
"judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a) 
when it is entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."

     As we held in United States v. Feuver, under FRAP 4(a), 
"in order to start the clock on a party's right to appeal, the 
district court must enter a judgment that complies with Rule 
58."  236 F.3d 725, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  see also United 
States v. Haynes, 158 F.3d 1327, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  
Diamond v. McKenzie, 770 F.2d 225, 227-28 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  
The same is true with respect to the time period for filing a 
FRAP 4(a)(6) motion, as that is triggered by the same event.  
See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), (7).  And because Rule 11 directs 
that the time for appeal from s 2255 orders "is as provided in 
Rule 4(a)," the Rule 58 trigger applies to appeals from such 
orders as well.

     Several of our sister circuits have applied Rule 58 to s 2255 
proceedings.3  Only the Second Circuit has declined to do so.  
Observing that the Advisory Committee notes to the Rules 

__________
     3  The Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits have applied Rule 58 
in published opinions, see Jenkins v. United States, 325 F.2d 942, 
944-45 (3d Cir. 1963);  Sassoon v. United States, 549 F.2d 983, 984-
85 (5th Cir. 1977);  Hope v. United States, 43 F.3d 1140, 1142 & n.1 
(7th Cir. 1994), while four others have done so in unpublished 
dispositions, see United States v. Smith, No. 00-6126, 2000 WL 
935425, at *1 n.* (4th Cir. July 10, 2000);  United States v. Bailey, 
No. 99-6250, 2000 WL 309296, at *1 (10th Cir. Mar. 27, 2000);  Sims 

Governing Section 2255 Proceedings state that " 'a motion 
under s 2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case 
and not a separate civil action,' " the Second Circuit concluded 
that such a motion "is not subject to Rule 58 of the civil 
rules."  Williams v. United States, 984 F.2d 28, 30 (2d Cir. 
1993) (quoting Rule 11, advisory committee's notes).4

     We find ourselves in agreement with the bulk of the 
circuits and in disagreement with the Second.  The same 
Advisory Committee notes referred to by the Second Circuit 
in Williams v. United States point out that in United States 
v. Hayman, the Supreme Court held that appeals from 
orders denying motions under s 2255 "are governed by the 
civil rules applicable to appeals from final judgments in 
habeas corpus actions."  Rule 11, advisory committee's notes 
(quoting United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 209 n.4 
(1952)).5  Indeed, the Advisory Committee notes explain that 
the portion of Rule 11 at issue here--the sentence stating 

__________
v. United States, No. 98-1228, 1999 WL 1000855, at *3 (6th Cir. Oct. 
29, 1999);  United States v. Hogle, No. 96-17336, 1997 WL 599401, 
at *1 (9th Cir. Sept. 22, 1997).  Only the Fifth Circuit's opinion in 
Sassoon considered in any depth the issue of whether Rule 58 
should apply in s 2255 proceedings.  See Sassoon, 549 F.2d at 984-
85.

     4  But see Masotto v. United States, No. 97-2894, 2000 WL 
19096, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan. 5, 2000) (unpublished decision applying 
Rule 58 to a s 2255 proceeding).

     5  As the Advisory Committee notes further observe, Hayman 
cited Mercado v. United States, 183 F.2d 486 (1st Cir. 1950), in 
support of this proposition.  See Hayman, 342 U.S. at 209 n.4.  In 
Mercado, the First Circuit rejected the argument that because 
s 2255 proceedings are criminal in nature, the time for appeal is 
limited to the ten-day period allowed for criminal appeals.  The 
Mercado court relied both on the language of s 2255 itself, which 
provides that "[a]n appeal may be taken to the court of appeals 
from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on 
application for a writ of habeas corpus," and on Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 81(a)(2), which states that "[t]hese rules are appli-
cable to proceedings for ... habeas corpus ... to the extent that 
the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes ... and 

that "[t]he time for appeal from an order entered on a 
[s 2255 motion] is as provided in Rule 4(a) of the Federal 
Rules of Appellate Procedure"--was added in 1979 to clarify 
that Hayman's instruction to apply the civil rules to such an 
appeal was still good law, "[e]ven though" the revised s 2255 
rules were based upon the premise that "section 2255 pro-
ceedings are a further step in the criminal case."  Rule 11, 
advisory committee's notes.

     Nor do we agree with Williams' further suggestion that 
Rule 11 should be read to incorporate only FRAP 4(a)'s sixty-
day period for filing civil appeals,6 and not its other provi-
sions.  See 984 F.2d at 30.  Nothing in the language of Rule 
11, which simply states that the time for appeal is "as 
provided in Rule 4(a)," suggests that courts should apply Rule 
4(a)'s time limit without also applying its criterion for deter-
mining when that limit begins to run.  We therefore follow 
Rule 11's express direction to apply FRAP 4(a) to s 2255 
appeals, and then follow FRAP 4(a)'s equally clear direction 
to apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 to determine 
when a judgment is entered and hence when the time for 
appeal begins.

                               III

     Having concluded that Rule 58 applies to s 2255 proceed-
ings, we must now determine whether the requirements of 
the rule were satisfied in this case.  As described above, 
although a party must file a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen the 
time to file an appeal within 180 days of the entry of a 
judgment or order, the 180-day time period does not begin to 
run until entry of a judgment or order that complies with 

__________
has heretofore conformed to the practice in civil actions."  Mercado, 
183 F.2d at 487;  cf. Rule 11, Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in 
the United States District Courts, 28 U.S.C. foll. s 2254 ("The 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that they are not 
inconsistent with these rules, may be applied, when appropriate, to 
petitions filed under these rules.").

     6  Cf. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (providing ten-day period for 
filing criminal appeals).

Rule 58.  More important, although without an extension a 
prisoner has only sixty days to file an appeal, that deadline, 
too, does not begin to run until the entry of a complying 
judgment or order.  Hence, if we conclude that the order of 
the district court did not comply with Rule 58, that means not 
only that Johnson's 180-day window for seeking reopening 
has not yet closed, but that Johnson does not need such an 
extension because his initial sixty-day window for filing an 
appeal has not yet even opened.

     In relevant part, Rule 58 states:  "Every judgment shall be 
set forth on a separate document.  A judgment is effective 
only when so set forth and when entered as provided in Rule 
79(a)."  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a), in turn, pro-
vides:  "All ... orders ... and judgments shall be entered 
chronologically in the civil docket....  These entries ... 
shall show ... the substance of each order or judgment of the 
court...."

     We have held that a judgment does not satisfy Rule 58 if 
"the inclusion of legal reasoning and authority" reaches the 
point of making "an order into a combined decision and 
order."  Diamond, 770 F.2d at 230 n.10.  We have also held, 
however, that a "single document that disposes of all remain-
ing claims can satisfy Rule 58 so long as it is sufficiently 
terse."  Kidd v. District of Columbia, 206 F.3d 35, 37 (D.C. 
Cir. 2000).  There is no doubt that if the twelve pages issued 
by the district court in this case were regarded as one 
document, that document would not satisfy the requirements 
of Rule 58.  See Haynes, 158 F.3d at 1331 (holding that a 
three-page "Memorandum Opinion & Order" containing the 
district court's reasoning and case citations failed to comply 
with the separate document requirement).  There is also no 
doubt that if the twelfth page--consisting of a single sentence 
denying Johnson's motion and bereft of any case citation or 
reasoning--were regarded as standing alone, it would satisfy 
Rule 58's standard.  See Kidd, 206 F.3d at 39 (holding that 
Rule 58 allows "inclusion of at least one citation to legal 
authority and at least a one-sentence explanation of the 
court's reasoning").  Thus, the dispositive question is whether 
the district court issued a twelve-page combined decision and 

order, or whether it issued an eleven-page decision and a 
separate one-page order.

     We conclude that the "Order" in this case is not a separate 
document and thus that the district court's decision does not 
satisfy the requirements of Rule 58.7  We reach that conclu-
sion based not on any one factor, but on the collective effect 
of several characteristics of the twelve pages at issue in this 
case.  First, although it is not decisive that the page entitled 
"Order" is stapled together with the eleven other pages, that 
fact--together with the title of the first stapled page, "Memo-
randum and Order"--creates confusion as to whether the 
twelfth page is separate from the first eleven or simply the 
last page of a combined Memorandum and Order.8  Second, 

__________
     7  The fact that the page is labeled "Order" rather than 
"Judgment" is not relevant.  Although Rule 58 speaks only of 
"judgment[s]," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(a) defines a 
"judgment" as including "any order from which an appeal lies."  
Moreover, s 2255 states that an appeal "may be taken to the 
court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a 
final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus."  28 
U.S.C. s 2255 (emphasis added).  Furthermore, FRAP 4(a) pro-
vides that an appeal must be filed within sixty days after the 
"judgment or order" appealed from is entered, see Fed. R. App. P. 
4(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added), and FRAP 4(a)(7) provides that a 
"judgment or order" is entered for purposes of FRAP 4(a) when 
it is entered in compliance with Rule 58, see Fed. R. App. P. 
4(a)(7) (emphasis added).  The final order in a s 2255 proceeding 
serves the same function as a judgment, see United States v. 
Perez, 736 F.2d 236, 238 n.3 (5th Cir. 1984), and "a document 
labeled 'Order' rather than 'Judgment' may satisfy Rule 58 suffi-
ciently to start the appeal clock running," Kidd, 206 F.3d at 41 
n.2 (quoting Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 32 n.4 
(D.C. Cir. 1990));  see also Diamond, 770 F.2d at 230 & n.10.

     8  See Whitaker v. City of Houston, 963 F.2d 831, 833 (5th Cir. 
1992) ("Until set forth on a separate document in compliance with 
Rule 58, a statement tacked on at the end of an opinion is not a 
judgment.");  Nunez-Soto v. Alvarado, 956 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992) 
("Rule 58 requires that a judgment be set forth on a separate 
document and not simply tacked on to a memorandum or opinion.");  

the first eleven pages are unsigned;  only the twelfth page 
bears a signature line, and only that line is signed.  This 
would give a reasonable person cause to believe that the 
twelve pages are a single document, signed on the document's 
last page--or at least cause to be confused over the question.  
Third, only the first page is file-stamped;  the twelfth is not.  
This suggests that the Clerk of the Court herself understood 
the twelve pages to be a single document.  That inference is 
confirmed by a final factor:  the only recorded docket entry is 
for a "Memorandum and Order," the title of the first of the 
twelve pages.9  There is no separate entry for an "Order"--
the title of the twelfth page--as there would be if the Clerk 
had understood it to be a separate document.  See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 79(a) ("All papers filed with the clerk, all ... orders 
... and judgments shall be entered chronologically in the 
civil docket....  These entries ... shall show the nature of 
each paper filed or writ issued and the substance of each 
order or judgment of the court...."  (emphasis added)).

     The "purpose of Rule 58's separate document requirement 
was to clarify when the time for an appeal begins to run," in 
order "to prevent uncertainty 'over what actions ... would 
constitute an entry of judgment, and occasional grief to 
litigants as a result of this uncertainty.' "  Haynes, 158 F.3d 
at 1329 (quoting United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216, 
220 (1973)).  The drafters thought that such uncertainty 
would be eliminated "by requiring that there be a judgment 
set out on a separate document--distinct from any opinion or 
memorandum--which provides the basis for the entry of 
judgment."  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 advisory committee's notes,

Cir. 1978) ("[A]n order of dismissal tacked onto the end of an 
opinion, no matter how explicit, simply does not qualify as a 
separate document for the purpose of evaluating the timeliness of 
an appeal.").

     9  Cf. Caperton, 585 F.2d at 689 (finding that an order of 
dismissal at the end of a decision was not entered as a separate 
judgment because, inter alia, the single docket sheet notation 
referred to the exact title that appeared on the decision:  "Opinion 
and Order").

1963 amendment;  see also Diamond, 770 F.2d at 229 n.9.  In 
this case, it is unclear whether there is a judgment "distinct 
from any opinion or memorandum."  Far from eliminating 
uncertainty, the twelve pages issued by the district court 
generate confusion as to whether a judgment has properly 
been entered.  And, as we held in Diamond:  "It is precisely 
this kind of uncertainty ... that warrants the mechanical 
application of Rule 58.  By mechanically applying this rule, as 
the Supreme Court has taught us to do, a court may avoid 
speculation as to whether an appellant should or should not 
have known that the time for appeal had begun to run."  770 
F.2d at 230 (footnote omitted).  Following this direction, we 
hold that because a judgment concluding Johnson's s 2255 
proceeding has not been set forth on a separate document, an 
effective judgment has not yet been entered in his case.

                                IV

     Our conclusion that a qualifying Rule 58 judgment has not 
yet been entered means that Johnson's time to appeal from 
the denial of his s 2255 motion has not yet begun to run, 
much less run out.  For that reason, not only was Johnson's 
FRAP 4(a)(6) motion to reopen the time for appeal not 
untimely, it was not necessary.  See Pack v. Burns Int'l Sec. 
Serv., 130 F.3d 1071, 1072 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding that 
"[b]ecause the district court's order failed to comply with 
Rule 58, [appellant's] notice of appeal cannot be considered 
late").  Accordingly, the district court's August 4, 1999 order 
denying Johnson's FRAP 4(a)(6) motion is vacated as moot.

     Johnson has not yet appealed to this court from the district 
court's July 16, 1998 order denying his s 2255 motion, and we 
therefore remand the case to the district court to permit 
Johnson to take the steps necessary to perfect an appeal.  
Those steps should include entry by the court of an order 
conforming to Rule 58.  Although entry of a conforming 
order is not necessary for the district court's decision to 
become appealable,10 "we again emphasize that, to avoid

from the denial of his s 2255 motion, Johnson must first 
obtain a certificate of appealability (COA), see 28 U.S.C. 
s 2253(c)(1)(B), and the initial application for such a certifi-

of appeal does not begin to run until the district court files a

     11  A COA is required to take an appeal from "the final order in 
a proceeding under section 2255."  28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1)(B).  The 
government contends that the denial of Johnson's FRAP 4(a)(6) 
motion was the final order in his s 2255 proceeding, and that 
because Johnson did not obtain a COA to appeal that order, this 
appeal should be dismissed even if the district court did not comply 
with Rule 58.  We may, however, resolve issues that are "jurisdic-
tional or have jurisdictional overtones" in any order.  In re Papan-
dreou, 139 F.3d 247, 254 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  see also Ruhrgas AG v. 
Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 584-85 (1999).  The district court's 
compliance with Rule 58 (as incorporated in FRAP 4(a)(1) and 
4(a)(6)), is that kind of issue.  See Feuver, 236 F.3d at 727 (noting 
that the time limits set out in FRAP 4(a) are "mandatory and 
jurisdictional");  Reich v. ABC/York-Estes Corp., 64 F.3d 316, 319 
(7th Cir. 1995) ("[C]ompliance with Rule 58 is jurisdictional in the 
sense that it determines when the time for appeal begins to run, but 
it is not to be so rigidly enforced that parties may not waive it.").  
As noted above, we have concluded that the district court's decision 
did not comply with Rule 58, and that as a result Johnson did not 
need a FRAP 4(a)(6) order in the first place--although he does now 
require a COA to take an appeal from the denial of his s 2255 
motion.  Accordingly, we have no need to consider whether Johnson 
would also have required a COA to appeal from the denial of a 
request for a FRAP 4(a)(6) order, had such an order been necessary 
to render his s 2255 appeal timely.

Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge, concurring:

     I agree with my brethren but write separately to empha-
size caution in applying their approach too broadly.  The 
United States Supreme Court commands a mechanical appli-
cation of Rule 58.  See United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 
216, 222 (1973) (per curiam) ("separate document" provision 
of Rule 58 "must be mechanically applied to avoid new 
uncertainties as to the date on which a judgment is entered").  
But such a mechanical application must be leavened with 
common sense.  For example, the single citation/single sen-
tence rule developed in this Circuit properly utilizes common 
sense in separating the conforming from the non-conforming.  
See Kidd v. District of Columbia, 206 F.3d 35, 37-39 (D.C. 
Cir. 2000) ("[I]t is one thing to say that Rule 58 creates a 
straightjacket, another to define the straightjacket's precise 
measurements.");  Diamond by Diamond v. McKenzie, 770 
F.2d 225, 230 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Taking a similar common 
sense approach here, I believe, as is clear to any reasonable 
reader, that the district court penned a final, appealable 
judgment when it signed and issued the July 10, 1998 Order.  
I am unconvinced that the three "mistakes" emphasized by 
the majority--the stapling of the Order to the Memorandum, 
the district court's failure to sign the Memorandum and the 
Clerk's failure to file-stamp the Order--melded the Order 
and Memorandum into one.*  First, the fact that the Order is 
stapled to the accompanying Memorandum does not trans-
form it to mere ordering language tacked on to the Memoran-
dum. Physical attachment, whether it be by a staple, paper 
clip or otherwise, cannot be determinative;  we should, if 
anything, encourage attachment to promote order.  The ma-
jority cites cases disfavoring judgments "tacked on" to opin-
ions.  See Maj. Op. at 9-10 & n.8.  But in each of the cases, 
"tacked on" describes ordering language which, by my read-
ing, appears to be included within or at the conclusion of a 
court's opinion or memorandum, not in an order on a separate 
page with a separate heading.  See Whitaker v. City of 
Houston, 963 F.2d 831, 833 (5th Cir. 1992) (ruling included at

     * If it did, it would, as the majority recognizes, see Maj. Op. at 8, 
plainly violate our single citation rule since it would then encompass 
the multiple citations contained in the Memorandum.

end of opinion);  Caperton v. Beatrice Pocahontas Coal Co., 
585 F.2d 683, 689 (4th Cir. 1978) ("notation" at end of ten-
page opinion);  see also Nunez-Soto v. Alvarado, 956 F.2d 1, 2 
(1st Cir. 1992) (judgment with single sentence of reasoning 
satisfies Rule 58 although tacked on judgments do not).  
Likewise, the unsigned Memorandum has no effect on wheth-
er the signed Order is a separate document under Rule 58.  
Finally, the Clerk's failure to file-stamp the Order is irrele-
vant to the Order qua a separate document;  the separate 
document requirement of Rule 58 addresses how the judg-
ment must be "set forth," not how it is recorded or treated by 
the Clerk.  In any event the Clerk sufficiently complied with 
Rule 79(a) in entering the Order--the docket entry accurately 
depicts its "nature" and "substance."  The Clerk's mistake 
was in failing to enter both the Order and the Memorandum.

     Nevertheless, because the opinion is narrow, applying only 
to the unusual facts here, and because our precedent favors 
dotting each "i" and crossing each "t" in applying Rule 58, I 
join in the remand.
