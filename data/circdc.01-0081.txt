     Before:  Williams, Sentelle and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  In these two appeals, the court 
must determine whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated 
proximate cause in seeking, on an aggregate basis, to recover 
costs incurred as a result of paying for the health care needs 
of individual smokers.  The complaints allege conspiracy and 
fraud in connection with federal antitrust and racketeering 
("RICO") claims as well as antitrust claims under District of 
Columbia law and common law claims.  Similar claims have 
been considered and rejected as too remote by seven other 
circuits.  Because we agree with the other circuits that the 
alleged injuries of the third-party payors are too remote to 
have been proximately caused by the defendants' alleged 
conduct, we reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss with 
respect to the RICO and fraud claims in Service Employees 
International Union Health and Welfare Fund v. Philip 
Morris Inc., 83 F. Supp. 2d 70 (D.D.C. 1999) ("Service 
Employees"), and otherwise affirm the dismissal of the com-

plaints in Republic of Guatemala v. Tobacco Institute, Inc., 
83 F. Supp. 2d 125 (D.D.C. 1999) ("Guatemala").

                                I.

                                A.

     In Service Employees, several labor-management health 
trust funds ("the funds"), see 29 U.S.C. s 186(c)(5) (1994), 
sued Philip Morris, other tobacco companies, and other enti-
ties related to the tobacco industry, alleging a fraudulent 
scheme to preserve their control of the cigarette market and 
to avoid the costs of treating smoking-related diseases by 
counteracting smokers' efforts to quit, by impairing the abili-
ty of health care providers to reduce costs through effective 
smoking cessation programs and safer cigarettes, and by 
concealing the tobacco industry's active role in manipulating 
and perpetuating the resulting health care crisis.  The funds 
seek to recover their payments for participants' smoking-
related health care costs by "su[ing] in their own capacities, 
rather than asserting claims in subrogation on behalf of 
individual [f]und beneficiaries."

     The district court granted the defendants' motion to dis-
miss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) the 
funds' local and federal antitrust claims for lack of an anti-
trust injury and for failure to specify antitrust damages.  
Service Employees, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 89-91.  The court 
dismissed the funds' fraud claims without prejudice for failure 
to plead fraud with particularity as required by Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 9(b).  Id. at 91-92.  The district court also 
dismissed the funds' special duty, indemnity, and unjust 
enrichment claims.  Id. at 92-94.  Denying the motion to 
dismiss with respect to the funds' RICO claims, however, the 
district court accepted the funds' characterization of their 
injuries as "direct injuries to the trust assets," id. at 86, or 
harm "to their infrastructure and financial health and stabili-
ty," id., and rejected the view that such damages are entirely 
derivative of the harm suffered by the funds' beneficiaries, id. 
at 89.  While the district court acknowledged the analytical 
framework provided by the Supreme Court in Associated 

General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State 
Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519 (1983) ("AGC"), and 
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 
U.S. 258 (1992), it addressed proximate cause in terms of 
foreseeability and direct consequences, guided by the two-
part test set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts s 431 
(1965).  Service Employees, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 80-83.  The 
district court concluded that foreseeable harm to the funds 
stemming from defendants' alleged conduct was "obvious," id. 
at 84, and resolved difficulties otherwise posed by the nature 
of the funds' claims by invoking "the inherent ability and 
flexibility of our common-law based legal system to respond 
to the demands of a case as difficult as this," id. at 79-80.

     The defendants, in seeking reversal on the RICO and fraud 
claims, rely principally on what they characterize as "150 
years of controlling precedent" regarding proximate cause 
under the common law that the Supreme Court's decisions in 
AGC and Holmes have incorporated in analyzing standing to 
pursue federal antitrust and RICO claims.  Holmes, 503 U.S. 
at 267-70;  AGC, 459 U.S. at 529-35.  In addition to relying 
on the rule that one who pays the medical expenses of 
another may not recover in a direct suit against the tortfeasor 
but must proceed by way of subrogation, cf. Indus. Risk 
Insurers v. Creole Prod. Servs., Inc., 746 F.2d 526, 528 (9th 
Cir. 1984);  Rock Island Bank v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 692 
F.2d 1100, 1106-07 (7th Cir. 1982);  Great Am. Ins. Co. v. 
United States, 575 F.2d 1031, 1033-34 (2d Cir. 1978), the 
defendants rely on the decisions of the circuit courts of appeal 
that have rejected such third-party payor suits against the 
tobacco industry.  The funds, in turn, appeal the dismissal of 
all of their other claims save for their special duty and 
indemnity claims.

                                B.

     The Republics of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Ukraine ("the 
nations") seek to distinguish their claims from those of the 
typical third-party payor whose fate is sealed by the decisions 
of other circuits.  They contend that as sovereign nations 

constitutionally (or otherwise legally) obligated to provide 
free health care and other forms of social welfare to their 
residents, or at least to those who cannot afford to pay for 
such benefits, they have suffered economic harms to their 
treasuries that are independent of any harms allegedly suf-
fered by their residents as a result of smoking defendants' 
products.  The nations maintain that they are not only the 
best but the only plaintiffs who can recover for the economic 
harm allegedly suffered by their public fiscs.  Further, they 
claim a purported right to sue in parens patriae that they 
view as overcoming concerns about their standing to recover 
their economic losses under RICO and the federal antitrust 
laws.

     The district court dismissed the complaints in their entire-
ty.  Guatemala, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 128.1  Without adopting 
the defendants' position that the nations are merely complain-
ing of a purely derivative harm, and acknowledging that the 
doctrine of remoteness affords courts flexibility in determin-
ing whether the alleged injury is remote from the alleged 
misconduct, the district court considered it "abundantly clear 
that the injury that [the nations] purportedly suffered oc-
curred only as a consequence of the harm to individual 
smokers."  Id. at 129.  The district court concluded that the 
"tortured path" from the defendants' alleged wrongdoing to 
the nations' increased expenditures "demonstrates that [the 
nations'] claims are precisely the type of indirect claims that 
the proximate cause requirement is intended to weed out."  
Id. at 130 (quoting Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare 
Fund v. Philip Morris Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 930 (3d Cir. 1999) 
("Steamfitters")).

     In seeking reversal, the nations contend that the district 
court misapplied the Holmes factors, ignored the foreseeable 
nature of the harms alleged as well as public policy consider-
ations in conducting its proximate cause analysis, failed to 
address the alternate chain of causation alleged by the na-
tions, and failed to acknowledge the nations' unique status as

plaints of Nicaragua and the Ukraine for the reasons in Guatemala.

foreign sovereigns.  Essentially, the nations urge this court 
to adopt the district court's proximate cause analysis in 
Service Employees and to give special weight to their right to 
sue as parens patriae.  They also contend that the district 
court erred in not allowing them to replead their fraud and 
RICO claims.  See Guatemala, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 135 n.8.

                               II.

     Our review of the district courts' partial denial and grant of 
the defendants' motions to dismiss the complaints under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is de novo.  See 
Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 
(D.C. Cir. 1994).  Because the relevant legal analysis appears 
in several comprehensive decisions of other circuit courts of 
appeal, our analysis is brief.

     To date, seven circuit courts of appeal have rejected claims 
similar to those brought by the funds and the nations by 
generally concluding that the alleged injuries are too remote 
and, therefore, are not redressable for lack of proximate 
cause.2  In Service Employees, the funds seek to distinguish 
these cases principally on the ground that the circuits have 
engaged in an overly mechanical analysis of proximate cause 
and ignored congressional intent and important public policies

underlying RICO.  Pointing to RICO's history and purpose, 
see Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 519-20 
(1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting), the funds maintain that 
Congress intended to afford a remedy where, as here, in the 
funds' words, "people, with common law claims, ... were not 
able to adequately oppose an industry of companies conspir-
ing together to commit misconduct more akin to the racke-
teering of organized crime than to garden-variety product 
liability torts and isolated instances of fraud or deceit."  
Health care payors, by contrast, "were the type of business 
entities that suffered ... economic injuries, and that had the 
size and power to mount credible attacks as private attorneys 
general to assist governmental law enforcement efforts."  
Therefore, Holmes, AGC, Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 
U.S. 720 (1977), and similar cases are distinguishable and 
properly understood as the Supreme Court's effort to choose 
among multiple possible plaintiffs that have suffered economic 
injury and to select only the most efficient and directly 
injured plaintiff.  Furthermore, the funds contend that a 
proper analysis of the Holmes factors demonstrates that they 
have standing to pursue their RICO claims against the tobac-
co industry.  In a somewhat similar vein, the nations contend 
that the district court's conclusion in Guatemala failed to 
recognize the unique status of the nations as foreign sover-
eigns seeking to protect their governments' treasuries 
through parens patriae actions.

     The funds and the nations err in assuming that the proxi-
mate cause analysis called for by AGC and Holmes is a quest 
for the "best" (or, realistically, "least bad") plaintiff.  Rather, 
the Supreme Court has insisted on an appropriate plaintiff, 
namely, a plaintiff whose alleged injury possesses a sufficient-
ly direct causal relationship to the alleged wrongdoing.  See 
AGC, 459 U.S. at 533-35;  see also Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268-
70.  The problem for the plaintiffs arises from long-standing 
common law principles which the Supreme Court has incorpo-
rated into the proximate cause requirement for purposes of 
determining standing to bring RICO and federal antitrust 
claims.

     By relying on the analysis of RICO's legislative history set 
forth in Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion in Sedima, 473 
U.S. at 512-13, an approach rejected by the Court's majority, 
id. at 497 n.15, the funds seek to show that in enacting RICO 
Congress intended to adopt an analysis of the proximate 
causation requirement different from that identified by the 
Supreme Court in Holmes, 503 U.S. at 267-70.  There may 
be some tension between the Holmes (RICO) factors, which 
might be read simply to assert a single-factor direct-injury 
test that is merely supported by several policy factors.  See 
Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269, and the AGC (antitrust) approach, 
which balances the directness concerns along with other 
factors.  See AGC, 459 U.S. at 537-45.  This is not a pressing 
issue here, however, because it is not outcome determinative 
inasmuch as the funds and the nations lose under a pure 
directness test and under a balancing of the Holmes factors.

     The nations' assertion that they may proceed in parens 
patriae is a dubious assertion at best, for as the First Circuit 
pointed out in Estados Unidos Mexicanos v. DeCoster, 229 
F.3d 332, 336 (1st Cir. 2000), parens patriae standing should 
not be recognized in a foreign nation (by contrast with a State 
in this country) unless there is a clear indication by the 
Supreme Court or one of the two coordinate branches of 
government to grant such standing.  The nations offer no 
evidence of such intent.  In any event, they fail to show that 
such status eliminates or adequately substitutes for proximate 
cause.  Rather, the doctrine of parens patriae is merely a 
species of prudential standing, see Md. People's Counsel v. 
FERC, 760 F.2d 318, 321-22 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and does not 
create a boundless opportunity for governments to seek re-
covery for alleged wrongs against them or their residents.  
See, e.g., Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, 552 F.2d 612, 616 (8th Cir. 1975).

     Even were the court to view as oversimplified the defen-
dants' reliance on the settled rule barring direct suits by third 
parties seeking to recover the costs of medical care paid on 
behalf of individuals injured as a result of an alleged tortfea-

sor's conduct,3 application of the Holmes factors,4 503 U.S. at 
269-70, reveals that both the funds and the nations fail to 
demonstrate proximate cause.  With respect to the first 
Holmes factor, the circuits have generally concluded that 
damages for such claims are highly speculative and difficult to 
calculate given the many other potential causes for the al-
leged financial injuries.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 
703;  Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 441-42;5  Laborers Local, 191 
F.3d at 239-40;  Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 964-65;  Ste-
amfitters, 171 F.3d at 928-29;  cf. Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 823-
24.  Regarding the second Holmes factor, the circuits have 
concluded that allowing such claims to proceed would create a 
risk of multiple recoveries and necessitate complicated rules 
for apportioning damages between groups of plaintiffs re-
moved at various levels from the tobacco industry's alleged 
wrongdoing.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  Team-
sters, 196 F.3d at 823;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 240-41;  

__________
     3  Cf. Indus. Risk Insurers, 746 F.2d at 528;  Rock Island Bank, 
692 F.2d at 1106-07;  Great Am. Ins. Co., 575 F.2d at 1033-34.

     4  In explaining that the common law required "some direct 
relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct 
alleged," Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268, the Supreme Court characterized 
its decision in AGC as identifying three relevant considerations:  (1) 
the need for sufficiently direct factual causation in order to be able 
"to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the 
violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors";  (2) the 
avoidance of "complicated rules apportioning damages among plain-
tiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts [so 
as] to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries";  and (3) the assurance 
that "directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindi-
cate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the 
problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely."  
Id. at 269-70 ("the Holmes factors").

     5  The decisions of the Third and Ninth Circuits in Allegheny 
and Washington Public Hospital are instructive with respect to the 
nations' claims because, like the nations, the plaintiffs in both cases 
were legally obligated to directly provide health care to smokers 
who could not afford to pay for such services.  See Wash. Pub. 
Hosp., 241 F.3d at 700;  Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 436, 443.

Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 965-66;  cf. Allegheny, 228 F.3d 
at 442;  Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 933.  The third Holmes the 
factor, the circuits have generally concluded, cannot outweigh 
important policies underlying the first two Holmes factors, 
see Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 933-34;  see also Oregon Labor-
ers, 185 F.3d at 964, and furthermore, individual smokers may 
be counted on to vindicate the public interests at stake in the 
third factor by asserting various theories of recovery against 
the tobacco industry.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  
Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 823;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 241;  
Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 964.  In addition, the circuits 
have rejected the contention that specific intent is sufficient 
to demonstrate proximate cause, see Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 
439;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 241-42;  Steamfitters, 171 
F.3d at 925, or that the foreseeable nature of the harms 
alleged is sufficient to satisfy the proximate cause require-
ment.  See Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 926.  Furthermore, the 
Ninth and Third Circuits have rejected efforts to distinguish 
between third-party health care payors like the funds and 
direct health care providers like the nations with respect to 
the derivative nature of the harms alleged.  See Wash. Pub. 
Hosp., 241 F.3d at 702-03;  Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 440-41.

     We likewise hold that the harms alleged by the funds and 
the nations are too remote from the defendants' alleged 
wrongdoing to provide antitrust or RICO standing.  Neither 
the funds nor the nations have shown that their claimed 
economic harms were not caused by other independent fac-
tors or that difficult problems of duplicative recoveries or 
allocation of damages could be avoided were they allowed to 
proceed.  Indeed, as the defendants suggest, the alleged 
harm arising from payment of medical expenses by the funds 
and the nations is itself derivative of alleged injuries to 
individual smokers, and the alleged "infrastructure" harms 
are even more remote than the damages for medical pay-
ments because the potential for "infrastructure" harm does 
not exist until an actuarially significant number of medical 
payments on behalf of smokers has been made.  See Laborers 
Local, 191 F.3d at 239;  Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 963;  
Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 927-28;  cf. Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 
823-24.  Moreover, as the Seventh Circuit tellingly observed 
in Teamsters, insurers are hard pressed to demonstrate fi-

nancial harm flowing from the tobacco industry's alleged 
wrongdoing because they possess information that would have 
indicated a need to collect higher premiums from smokers.  
See Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 823-24, 826.

     The remote, derivative nature of the alleged injuries, in 
turn, makes more difficult the determination of the amount of 
damages that is attributable to the alleged wrongdoing, as 
distinct from other independent factors.  As the circuits have 
pointed out, considerable speculation would be involved in 
identifying the costs that have caused the alleged financial 
instability of the funds and similar costs to the nations' 
treasuries that the plaintiffs contend have deterred or pre-
vented them from financing various health care programs.  
See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  Allegheny, 228 F.3d 
at 441-42;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 239-40;  Oregon 
Laborers, 185 F.3d at 964-65;  Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 928-
30.  For example, it is difficult to know how smokers might 
have behaved with more complete information, see Laborers 
Local, 191 F.3d at 239-40;  Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 929, a 
problem compounded by the fact that the tobacco companies 
would be stripped of many defenses that would be available in 
a subrogation action.  See Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 823.  Reli-
ance on aggregate statistical proof, as the district court in 
Service Employees accepted (without prejudice to later attack 
by defendants, see 83 F. Supp. 2d at 88), and as the nations 
propose, compounds the difficulties and does not alter the 
speculative nature of the claimed damages.  See Allegheny, 
228 F.3d at 441-42;  Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 964-65;  
Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 928-29;  cf. Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 
823.  Moreover, the insurers have likely already passed the 
costs on to the directly injured through higher premiums.  
See Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 824.

     Allowing the funds and the nations to proceed would also 
require complex rules for apportioning damages between 
potential plaintiffs removed from the alleged wrongdoing by 
different levels of injury, as well as create a very real 
possibility of duplicative recoveries against the defendants.  
The need for complex rules apportioning damages arises 
because other indirectly injured parties might also sue.  As a 

result, courts would be required to allocate damages among 
various classes of directly and indirectly injured parties who 
are removed from the alleged torts by varying degrees and 
would be required to do so in a manner that protects the 
tobacco industry from being held repeatedly liable for the 
same alleged wrongdoing.  See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 273;  
AGC, 459 U.S. at 543-45;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 240-41;  
Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 965-66;  cf. Teamsters, 196 F.3d 
at 823-24.  See generally Ill. Brick, 431 U.S. at 737-38.

     The nations contend that because they are not private 
insurers they cannot bring a subrogation action.  Further, 
because they have assumed the responsibility of compensat-
ing the directly injured, they suggest that if they cannot 
recover in this action for the alleged harms, no one can.  
Assuming the premise to be correct (and the nations' submis-
sions are far from clear on the matter), the argument mistak-
enly assumes that it was Congress' intent that there must be 
recoveries, regardless of the burdens inflicted on the legal 
system and the significant policies captured in the first two 
Holmes factors.  See supra p. 10 n.4.  It seems especially 
implausible that Congress would have wished to saddle the 
United States judicial system with such burdens simply to 
accommodate the legal idiosyncrasies of foreign nations.  To 
the extent that such idiosyncrasies stand between the nations' 
smokers and recoveries in United States courts, the nations 
may wish to consider amendment of their domestic law.

     Relatedly, because individual smokers may seek recoveries 
for the same alleged conduct under state law theories and 
because employers, other health insurers, and other similar 
potential plaintiffs might also pursue similar antitrust and 
RICO claims against the tobacco industry, double recovery 
could occur.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  Team-
sters, 196 F.3d at 823;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 240-41;  
Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 966;  cf. Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 
442.  The district court's contrary view in Service Employees, 
83 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88, fails to take into account the 
collateral source rule, see District of Columbia v. Jackson, 
451 A.2d 867, 873 (D.C. 1982), and the limits of the single 
satisfaction rule, see Lamphier v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 524 A.2d 

729, 734 (D.C. 1987), which would not prevent multiple plain-
tiffs from obtaining duplicative recoveries from a single de-
fendant for a single tort.  See Guatemala, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 
131 n.3;  cf. Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 241.

     Virtually the same kinds of problems exist with respect to 
the nations' claims.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  
cf. Allegheny, 228 F.3d at 442;  Pfizer v. Lord, 522 F.2d at 
619-20.

     By its very nature, the common law proximate cause re-
quirement adopted by the Supreme Court in Holmes and 
AGC leaves open the possibility that "[s]ome injuries caused 
by an antitrust [or RICO] violation may thus be left unreme-
died for lack of a proper plaintiff."  Oregon Laborers, 185 
F.3d at 964.  See generally Ill. Brick, 431 U.S. at 745-47.  
The third Holmes factor, therefore, must be considered in the 
context of the proximate cause analysis as a whole rather 
than as a free-standing, independent ground for finding proxi-
mate causation.  Were satisfaction of the third Holmes factor 
necessary, the proximate cause analysis would be trans-
formed into a process for identifying the "best" plaintiff to 
assert certain antitrust or RICO claims, in contravention of 
AGC, 459 U.S. at 534-35.  Cf. Oregon Laborers, 185 F.3d at 
964.  Like other circuits, we conclude that individual smokers 
constitute a group of potential plaintiffs possessed of more 
direct claims who can be counted on to deter the alleged 
wrongdoing by asserting state law theories of recovery or 
perhaps even RICO and federal antitrust claims to the extent 
they can prove a measure of damages distinct from personal 
injuries.  See Wash. Pub. Hosp., 241 F.3d at 703;  Teamsters, 
196 F.3d at 823;  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 241;  Oregon 
Laborers, 185 F.3d at 964;  Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 933;  see 
also Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Ind. Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 
447, 461-62 (1986);  Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 
339 (1979).

     The funds' and the nations' reliance on the purportedly 
foreseeable nature of their injuries and the allegedly inten-
tional nature of defendants' wrongdoing is misplaced.  
"[F]oreseeability and direct injury (or remoteness) are dis-

tinct concepts, both of which must generally be established by 
a plaintiff."  Laborers Local, 191 F.3d at 236;  see also 
Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 926.  Defendants suggest that sub-
stitution of the former for the latter would enable circumven-
tion of the settled rule that one who pays the medical 
expenses of another may not recover those expenses in a 
direct suit against the tortfeasor but must proceed by way of 
subrogation.  In any event, specific intent to harm the plain-
tiffs by shifting smoking-related health care costs to them is 
alone insufficient to overcome the bar on remote claims.  See 
AGC, 459 U.S. at 537 & n.37;  Blue Shield of Va. v. 
McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 478-79 (1982);  Laborers Local, 191 
F.3d at 241-42;  Steamfitters, 171 F.3d at 925.

     Accordingly, because the funds' and the nations' claims are 
"too remote, contingent, derivative, and indirect to survive," 
Guatemala, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 130,6 we reverse the denial of 
the motion to dismiss the RICO and fraud claims in Service 
Employees, and we otherwise affirm the dismissals of the 
complaints in Service Employees and Guatemala.

     6  The failure of the funds and the nations to demonstrate 
proximate cause under Holmes with respect to their RICO and 
federal antitrust claims also means that their antitrust and common 
law claims under District of Columbia law fail for lack of proximate 
cause.  See McKethean v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 588 
A.2d 708, 716 (D.C. 1991);  Lacy v. District of Columbia, 424 A.2d
