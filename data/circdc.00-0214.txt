          Appeal from the United States District Court 
                  for the District of Columbia 
                          (No. 99cv0306)

     Gordon E. Price, pro se.

     Wilma A. Lewis, United States Attorney, and R. Craig 
Lawrence and Edward D. Alkalay, Assistant United States 
Attorneys, were on motion for the appellees.

     Before:  Ginsburg, Sentelle and Henderson, Circuit 
Judges.

             Opinion for the court filed Per Curiam.

     Per Curiam:  Gordon Price, appearing pro se, filed a com-
plaint in the district court alleging the United States Depart-
ment of Veteran Affairs (VA) wrongfully failed to reimburse 
him for certain medical expenses he incurred in October 1994 
while hospitalized for an emergency colon cancer operation at 
a non-VA medical facility.  Price also alleged Northeast Flori-
da Credit Bureau (Northeast) caused him harm when it 
persistently sought to collect on the unpaid medical bills on 
behalf of the medical service providers.  As relief, Price 
sought $5 million in damages from the government alone, 
apparently for his medical expenses and emotional distress.  
The district court vacated an entry of default against North-
east and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. 
Price appealed and both he and the government filed cross-
motions for summary disposition.  Because the district court 
lacked jurisdiction to consider an indirect challenge to the 
government's veterans' benefits determination, we grant the 
government's motion and deny Price's motion.

     As amended by the Veterans Judicial Review Act, Pub. L. 
No. 100-687, 102 Stat. 4105 (1988) (VJRA), the Veterans' 
Benefits Act of 1957, Pub. L. No. 85-56, 71 Stat. 83, precludes 
judicial review in Article III courts of VA decisions affecting 
the provision of veterans' benefits, including medical expense 
reimbursement.  38 U.S.C. s 511(a);  see Larrabee v. Derwin-
ski, 968 F.2d 1497, 1499-1501 (2d Cir. 1992) (detailing history 
of veterans' benefits legislation);  see also Zimick v. West, 11 
Vet. App. 45, 48 (Vet. App. 1998) (term "benefit" encompasses 
medical expenses veteran incurred at non-VA facility) (citing 
38 C.F.R. s 20.3(e)).  The exclusive avenue for redress of 
veterans' benefits determinations is appeal to the Court of 
Veterans Appeals and from there to the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  See 38 U.S.C. ss 511, 
7252, 7292;  In re Russell, 155 F.3d 1012 (8th Cir. 1998) (per 
curiam);  Beamon v. Brown, 125 F.3d 965, 967-71 (6th Cir. 
1997);  Larrabee, 968 F.2d at 1501.

     The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Price's 
federal claim because underlying the claim is an allegation 
that the VA unjustifiably denied him a veterans' benefit.  
Price alleged the VA's failure to pay his medical bills was 

wrongful because the agency was under a legal obligation to 
make payment on account of Price's veteran status.  He 
attached to his amended complaint a September 1996 letter 
from the VA's Gainesville, Florida office advising Price the 
office had received his request for reimbursement but could 
not process his claim because Price failed to provide the 
personal information necessary to verify his veteran status 
and ascertain the nature of the claim.  In the letter, the VA 
explained the eligibility criteria for reimbursement for medi-
cal services at a non-VA facility and directed Price's attention 
to an enclosed claim form.  See 38 U.S.C. s 1728 (setting 
forth scheme for VA reimbursement of certain medical ex-
penses incurred by veterans).  Price referred to the 1996 
letter in the amended complaint, asserting that he met the 
eligibility criteria.

     The record does not reflect whether Price pursued a formal 
reimbursement claim with the VA.  Nevertheless, because 
Price is challenging the VA's action or inaction with respect 
to a veterans' benefits matter, the district court lacked sub-
ject matter jurisdiction over the complaint.  See 38 U.S.C. 
s 511(a);  Weaver v. United States, 98 F.3d 518, 519-20 (10th 
Cir. 1996) (the substance of veteran's claims, not the labels 
plaintiff assigns them, governs jurisdictional determination);  
cf. Kidwell v. Department of the Army, Bd. for Correction of 
Military Records, 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (plain 
language of complaint does not settle question of Tucker Act 
jurisdiction--court looks to the complaint's substance, not 
merely its form).

     Perhaps to avert a headlong collision with 38 U.S.C. 
s 511(a), the district court liberally construed Price's com-
plaint as asserting a federal tort claim for intentional or 
negligent failure to pay medical bills.  Under the Federal 
Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ss 1346(b), 2671 et seq., a tort 
claim is actionable if it arises "under circumstances where the 
United States, if a private person, would be liable to the 
claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act 
or omission occurred."  Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, 
510 U.S. 471, 477 (1994) (quoting 28 U.S.C. s 1346(b)).  Be-
cause the alleged wrong committed by the VA took place in 

Florida, liability for negligent or intentional failure to pay a 
medical bill must be determined in accordance with Florida 
law.  See Tarpeh-Doe v. United States, 28 F.3d 120, 123 
(D.C. Cir. 1994).

     Florida does recognize a cause of action analogous to that 
which Price appears to be asserting.  By Florida statute a 
person may sue an insurer when the person is damaged by an 
insurer's "bad faith" failure to settle his or her claim.  Fla. 
Stat. ch. 624.155(1)(b)(1);  see Time Ins. Co. v. Burger, 712 So. 
2d 389, 391 (Fla. 1998).  The Florida Supreme Court has 
construed the statute as encompassing claims that the insurer 
unjustifiably refused to pay an insured's medical or hospital 
bills, resulting in the insured's inability to obtain additional 
health care.  Burger, 712 So. 2d at 392.  The insured may 
also recover damages for emotional distress.  Id.

     Nevertheless, assuming Price's damages claim is cognizable 
under Florida Statute 624.155(1)(b)(1), a necessary predicate 
of such a claim is a determination that the insurer acted in 
bad faith.  See id.  Here, the propriety of the VA's purported 
refusal to reimburse Price has not yet been established.  
Because a determination whether the VA acted in bad faith or 
with negligence would require the district court to determine 
first whether the VA acted properly in handling Price's 
request for reimbursement, judicial review is foreclosed by 38 
U.S.C. s 511(a).  The courts have consistently held that a 
federal district court may not entertain constitutional or 
statutory claims whose resolution would require the court to 
intrude upon the VA's exclusive jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Beam-
on, 125 F.3d at 972-74 (due process challenge to VA proce-
dures);  Weaver, 98 F.3d at 520 (claims of fraud and misrepre-
sentation in handling of benefits claim);  Hicks v. Small, 69 
F.3d 967, 970 (9th Cir. 1995) (tort claims of outrage and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress based on VA's 
reduction of benefits);  Sugrue v. Derwinski, 26 F.3d 8, 11 (2d 
Cir. 1994) (due process, Privacy Act and FOIA challenges to 
VA's failure to raise disability rating);  Rosen v. Walters, 719 
F.2d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1983) (Privacy Act claim based on 
destruction of medical records pertinent to claim for veterans' 

disability benefits) (construing predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. 
s 211(a)).

     For the preceding reasons, we conclude the district court 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Price's federal claim.  
As a consequence, the court necessarily also lacked supple-
mental jurisdiction over Price's state law claim against North-
east.  See 28 U.S.C. s 1367(a);  Scarfo v. Ginsberg, 175 F.3d 
957, 962 (11th Cir. 1999) (collecting authorities);  Harris v. 
Secretary, United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 126 F.3d 
339, 346 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Accordingly, the judgment of the 
district court is

                                                                                  Affirmed.
