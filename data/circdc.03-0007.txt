     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  In the most recent chapter of this 
extremely protracted litigation, the district court, invoking 
s 114(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 ("Act"), Pub. L. No. 
102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 1079 (codified as an amendment to 42 
U.S.C. s 2000e-16(d)), ordered the U.S. Navy to pay prejudg-
ment interest on backpay and attorneys' fees for periods 
before November 21, 1991, to a class of women who success-
fully established that the Navy discriminated against them in 
employment on the basis of sex.  Trout v. England, No. 73-
55 (D.D.C. July 17, 2001);  see also Trout v. Dalton, No. 73-55 
(D.D.C. Aug. 12, 1998);  Trout v. Dalton, No. 73-55 (D.D.C. 
July 22, 1998).  The Navy appeals on the ground that 
s 114(2) cannot be applied retroactively to periods predating 
November 21, 1991, when s 114(2) became effective, citing 
Brown v. Sec'y of the Army, 78 F.3d 645 (D.C. Cir. 1996), 
cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1040 (1997), as dispositive.  Appellees 
would distinguish Brown on the ground that the Navy's 
liability was not finally determined until after s 114(2) be-
came effective.  Because the holding in Brown rested on 
considerations of sovereign immunity as enhanced by the rule 
of no-interest against the sovereign, it is dispositive, and 
accordingly we reverse the award of prejudgment interest to 
the Trout class for periods before November 21, 1991.

                                I.

     In 1991, when Congress enacted s 114(2), the Trout class 
action was almost twenty years old.  The litigation began in 
1973 when Navy computer analyst Yvonne Trout and other 
female employees of the Navy's computer operations center 
sued the Navy for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. s 2000e et seq.  The 
district court consolidated the complaints and certified a class 
of civilian women employees who worked for the Navy's 
computer operations center at any time between June 6, 1972 
and June 4, 1979.  In 1981, after a lengthy trial involving 
forty-two witnesses, more than 7,000 pages of exhibits, and 
extensive regression analyses demonstrating sex discrimina-
tion in the Navy's hiring, promotion, evaluation, and assign-
ment of women, the district court found the Navy liable for 
violating Title VII, Trout v. Hidalgo, 517 F. Supp. 873 
(D.D.C. 1981), and granted relief to the Trout class in the 
form of backpay.  Trout v. Hidalgo, 1981 WL 416 (D.D.C. 
1981).  Following appeals by the Navy, Trout v. Lehman, 702 
F.2d 1094 (D.C. Cir. 1983);  vacated and remanded, Lehman 
v. Trout, 465 U.S. 1056 (1984), the district court reinstated its 
finding of discrimination in 1986 on remand.  Trout v. Leh-
man, 652 F. Supp. 144 (D.D.C. 1986).

     On August 5, 1988, the district court made an interim 
award of attorneys' fees and costs to the Trout class, in the 
amounts of $276,044.00 and $15,434.01, respectively.  Trout v. 
Lehman, 702 F. Supp. 3, 4 (D.D.C. 1988).  The Navy appeal-
ed the order to pay the interim attorneys' fees on grounds of 
sovereign immunity.  Trout v. Garrett, 891 F.2d 332, 334 
(D.C. Cir. 1989).  This court, on December 15, 1989, denied 
the Navy's petition for mandamus and dismissed the appeal 
because the Navy conceded, and the court agreed, that 42 
U.S.C. s 2000e-5(k) "waives the United States' immunity 
from claims, whether final or interim, for attorneys' fees as an 
element of costs."  Id., 336.

     While the award of interim attorneys' fees was pending 
appeal, the district court, on October 12, 1988, ordered back-
pay relief for the Trout class dating back to 1970, with 
individual hearings to be held before a special master to 
determine each claimant's entitlement.  Trout v. Webb, 708 
F. Supp. 358, 358-59 (D.D.C. 1988).  After denying the 
Navy's motion for reconsideration, Trout v. Ball, 705 F. Supp. 
705 (D.D.C. 1989), the district court referred the claims to a 
special master with instructions to determine which statistical 
methodology was most appropriate for determining backpay.  
Id. at 358.  By memoranda and orders of March 30, 1990 and 
December 27, 1990, the special master accepted the statistical 
analysis for calculating backpay provided by the Trout class, 
and identified the members of the class entitled to relief.  
Trout v. Garrett, 1990 WL 96640 (D.D.C. 1990);  Trout v. 
Garrett, 1990 WL 301806 (D.D.C. 1990).

     Six days after s 114(2) became effective, the district court, 
on November 27, 1991, issued an order that (1) identified the 
class members entitled to backpay, (2) accepted the special 
master's findings that the Trout class' regression analysis 
should be used to determine the amount of backpay, and (3) 
awarded an interim backpay award of $670,402.75 for the 
period from June 1970 through April 30, 1979.  Trout v. 
Garrett, 780 F. Supp. 1396 (D.D.C. 1991).  Following this 
court's dismissal of the Navy's appeal of interim backpay for 
lack of jurisdiction, Trout v. Sec'y of the Navy, 971 F.2d 766 
(D.C. Cir. 1992) (per curiam), the district court ruled, on 
November 12, 1992, that the Trout class was entitled to 
additional backpay because of the Navy's "indefatigable" and 
"inappropriate" delay tactics spanning twenty years of litiga-
tion, and expanded the backpay award to cover "1979 to the 
present," then November 12, 1992.  Trout v. O'Keefe, 144 
F.R.D. 587, 588 (D.D.C. 1992).

     By stipulation of January 22, 1993, the parties agreed that 
the Trout class was entitled to additional backpay in the 
amount of $368,277.18 for the period from June 1, 1979 
through December 31, 1991.  In a settlement agreement of 

September 20, 1993, the parties agreed the eligible Trout 
class members were entitled to backpay through December 
31, 1991, and attorneys fees through May 17, 1993;  the Trout 
class reserved the right to seek interest on backpay and 
attorneys fees under s 114(2).  The district court approved 
the settlement agreement on November 22, 1993.  Regarding 
the reservation in the settlement agreement for interest, the 
Navy advised the district court that the government's position 
was that s 114(2) was not retroactive, and consequently, 
interest did not begin to run on backpay and attorneys' fees 
until November 21, 1991.  By stipulation of May 10, 1995, the 
Navy agreed to pay interest on backpay and attorneys' fees 
awards beginning on November 21, 1991, again preserving 
the Trout class's right to seek interest for periods prior to 
November 21, 1991.

     After this court issued its decision in Brown, 78 F.3d 645, 
holding that s 114(2) did not apply to a period before its 
effective date, the district court awarded the Trout class 
prejudgment interest back to 1970.  Trout v. Dalton, No. 73-
55 (D.D.C. Aug. 12, 1998);  Trout v. Dalton, No. 73-55 
(D.D.C. July 22, 1998).  The district court, adopting the Trout 
class' argument, interpreted Brown to bar s 114(2) interest 
only where the merits of the litigation had been completed 
before s 114(2) became effective, and concluded that "[b]e-
cause the instant case was very much alive and being actively 
litigated on [November 21, 1991], Brown is not dispositive and 
the [Trout class members] are entitled to prejudgment inter-
est."  While acknowledging that the "liability phase" had 
ended on April 25, 1990, the district court focused on the fact 
that the "award phase" was ongoing when s 114(2) became 
effective.  The court entered a final judgment for the Trout 
class on July 17, 2001, ordering the Navy to pay prejudgment 
interest, based on the prime rate, on backpay in the amount 
of $8,627,276.40, and interest on attorneys' fees in the amount 
of $1,477,020.90.  Trout v. England, No. 73-55 (D.D.C. July 
17, 2001).

                               II.

     Section 114(2) provides Title VII plaintiffs in suits against 
the federal government with "the same interest to compen-
sate for delay in payment [as is available] in cases against 
nonpublic parties."  42 U.S.C. s 2000e-16(d).  Whether 
s 114(2) permits prejudgment interest for periods prior No-
vember 21, 1991, when it became effective, is a question of 
law that the court reviews de novo.  Herbert v. Nat'l Acade-
my of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1992);  Cuddy v. 
Carmen, 762 F.2d 119, 123 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  However, this 
appeal turns on the proper interpretation of Brown, which, 
absent en banc review, binds the court on the question of law.  
See LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1395 (D.C. Cir. 
1996).  We turn, then, to an examination of the analysis in 
Brown.

                                A.

     Statutes waiving the sovereign immunity of the United 
States are subject to the rule of strict construction.  Library 
of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 318 (1986);  Ruckelshaus v. 
Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 685 (1983).  As such, waivers of 
sovereign immunity are to be read "no more broadly than 
[their] terms require."  Brown, 78 F.3d at 649.  Further, as 
the court had previously observed, "any doubts about the 
scope of a waiver [are to] be resolved in favor of the narrower 
governmental liability."  Nichols v. Pierce, 740 F.2d 1249, 
1257 (D.C. Cir. 1984);  see also Shaw, 478 U.S. at 318;  
Ruckelshaus, 463 U.S. 680 at 685.  These principles of sover-
eign immunity understandably take on "an added gloss of 
strictness" when applied to claims of interest against the 
United States because the historical "no-interest rule" bars 
recovery of interest against the government "unless the 
award of interest was affirmatively and separately contem-
plated by Congress."  Shaw, 478 U.S. at 315, 318-19;  see also 

Brown, 78 F.3d at 651;  Thompson v. Kennickell, 797 F.2d 
1015, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 1986).

     In Brown, the court held that the rule of strict construc-
tion, enhanced by the no-interest rule, applies whether the 
court is examining a statute's substantive scope or its tempo-
ral reach.  78 F.3d at 650.  The court's rationale was twofold.  
First, absent express direction from Congress that a statute 
is retroactive, to hold that a statute "waives sovereign immu-
nity from an element of damages not contemplated by [ ] 
Congress" or applies to "a period of time not envisioned by 
Congress," risks "imposing upon the public fisc an unantic-
ipated and potentially excessive liability."  Brown, 78 F.3d at 
650;  see also Shaw, 478 U.S. at 316;  Nichols, 740 F.2d at 
1255.  Second, the strict construction rule provides an impor-
tant backdrop against which Congress acts when it waives 
sovereign immunity.  Having indicated that this court "would 
take the legislature strictly at its word when it specifies 
whether and to what extent it waives sovereign immunity," 
the court in Brown concluded that it must presume that when 
Congress promulgates a waiver of sovereign immunity, it 
knows which principles will govern our interpretation of the 
waiver.  Id.

     Therefore, Brown examined the temporal reach of s 114(2) 
through the lens of strict construction, taking care not to 
extend the provision beyond Congress's intention.  Finding 
no evidence in the text or the legislative history of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1991 that Congress intended its provisions to 
operate retroactively, id. at 648, and noting that with the 
exception of two provisions of the Act that operate prospec-
tively, the Act otherwise states that it is to "take effect upon 
enactment," s 402(a), Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 
1099, the court held that s 114(2) was inapplicable where the 
government's liability was established and attorney's fees 
were incurred before s 114(2) became effective.  Id. at 647, 
654.  The court explained that to apply s 114(2) retroactively 
would be to impose liability on the government without its 
explicit, required consent.  Id. at 654.

                                B.

     The only question, then, is whether the holding in Brown 
turns on the timing of the discriminatory conduct at issue, as 
the Navy contends, or on procedural posture of the case, as 
the district court concluded and the Trout class maintains on 
appeal.  For the following reasons, we conclude that the 
district court misapplied Brown's retroactivity analysis by 
focusing on the procedural posture of the Trout litigation 
rather than the conduct underlying the litigation.

     The last paragraph of the opinion in Brown states in 
relevant part:

     Section 114(2) of the 1991 Act waives sovereign 
     immunity with respect to interest on attorney's fees 
     awarded under Title VII.  In the case at hand, the 
     litigation on the merits of Brown's claim was com-
     pleted and the attorney's fee incurred before the 
     statute became effective.  Therefore, to apply 
     s 114(2) retroactively in this case would be to im-
     pose upon the United States a liability to which it 
     has not explicitly consented.
     
78 F.3d at 654.  Both the district court and the Trout class 
rely upon this paragraph as grounds for distinguishing the 
instant case in which the final judgment on the remedy was 
not entered until after s 114(2) became effective.  See Trout 
v. Dalton, No. 73-55, slip op. at 2-3 (D.D.C. July 22, 1998);  
Appellee's Br. at 23.  With the exception of the italicized 
language, however, nothing in Brown suggests that the avail-
ability of prejudgment interest turns on the procedural pos-
ture of the litigation.  To the contrary, the court in Brown 
stated at the outset that the critical question was whether 
s 114(2) applies retroactively "to a case arising from conduct 
that occurred before it was enacted."  78 F.3d at 648 (empha-
sis added).  The court thus understood its focus to be on the 
conduct underlying the complaint, not the status of the litiga-
tion itself.  However confusing the reference to the status of 
the litigation in Brown be, it can only be understood as 
illustrating that there was no basis for an award of prejudg-

ment interest under s 114(2);  it cannot reasonably be read as 
altering the analysis on which the court relied in rejecting 
retroactive application of s 114(2).

     This understanding of the last sentence of the opinion in 
Brown is also clear from the fact that the court in Brown 
explained its task as one of reconciling the principles applica-
ble to waivers of sovereign immunity, articulated in Shaw and 
Ruckleshaus, with the principles applicable to retroactivity, 
articulated in Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., 416 U.S. 696 
(1974), and Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  
73 F.3d at 648.  Adopting the rules of strict construction 
central to Shaw and Ruckelshaus, the court stated that "the 
rule of strict construction displaces the Bradley analysis [that 
a court is to apply the law in effect at the time of its decision] 
when the question is whether a waiver of sovereign immunity 
is to be applied retroactively."  78 F.3d at 654.  The court did 
not displace, however, "the traditional presumption," affirmed 
in Landgraf, "against applying statutes affecting substantive 
rights, liabilities, or duties to conduct arising before their 
enactment."  511 U.S. at 278 (emphasis added);  see Brown, 
78 F.3d at 649-52.  To the contrary, Brown was informed by 
the Supreme Court's holding in Landgraf, which declined to 
give retroactive effect, absent congressional intent, to provi-
sions of the 1991 amendments that would attach new "mone-
tary liability ... to conduct occurring before the statute's 
enactment."  511 U.S. at 284 (emphasis added).  The two-
part rationale in Brown for employing the rule of strict 
construction mirrors the Court's language in Landgraf.  
Compare, e.g., Brown, 78 F.3d at 649-50, with Landgraf, 511 
U.S. at 265-66.  Moreover, Brown's conclusion that retroac-
tive application of s 114(2) would "impose upon the United 
States a liability to which it ha[d] not explicitly consented," id. 
at 654, was in keeping with Landgraf's instruction not to 
"impose[ ] new burdens on persons after the fact."  511 U.S. 
at 270.

     The Supreme Court's decisions in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 
289 (2001), and Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343 (1999), remove 
any doubt that the conduct underlying the complaint, rather 
than the procedural posture of the litigation, has significance 

in this context.  Both St. Cyr and Martin reiterate the view 
that "elementary considerations of fairness dictate that indi-
viduals should have an opportunity to know what the law is 
and to conform their conduct accordingly ..." St. Cyr, 533 
U.S. at 316 (citation omitted) (emphasis added);  see also 
Martin, 527 U.S. at 36-61.  Absent clear congressional intent, 
conduct "should be assessed under the law that existed when 
the conduct took place."  St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 316.  It follows, 
as the statement in Brown illustrated, that s 114(2) does not 
apply to conduct that occurred before November 21, 1991.  
Here, the Navy's discriminatory conduct against the Trout 
class ended in 1979, before s 114(2) became effective.  Trout 
v. Garrett, 780 F. Supp. 1396, 1400-01 (D.D.C. 1991).  Conse-
quently, prejudgment interest may not be awarded to the 
Trout class on backpay or attorneys' fees for periods prior to 
that date.  It is of no relevance whether the liability phase or 
the merits phase of the litigation was pending when s 114(2) 
became effective.  The purpose of the rule of strict construc-
tion, coupled with the no-interest rule and informed by Land-
graf, is to "protect the United States Treasury from potential-
ly excessive liabilities which Congress did not anticipate."  
Brown, 78 F.3d at 650 (internal quotations omitted).

     The Trout class disputes that the Navy's discriminatory 
conduct ended in 1979, maintaining that "the Navy continued 
to discriminate against women through at least December 31, 
1991."  This position is based both on the district court's 
extension of the backpay award to prevailing class members 
through December 31, 1991, and what the Trout class views 
as the Navy's implicit agreement, by stipulating to those 
payments, that it was liable for conduct through that date.  
But the district court's extension of the backpay award was 
remedial in nature, intended only to compensate the Trout 
class for the Navy's delaying litigation tactics;  the district 
court did not find that discrimination by the Navy against the 
Trout class extended past 1979.  Nor did the Navy implicitly 
agree that it was liable for discriminatory conduct through 
1991;  rather, the Navy stipulated only to the liability deter-
mined by the district court in 1986 on remand.

     Finally, in Brown the court found no evidence of congres-
sional intent to apply s 114(2) retroactively.  78 F.3d at 648.  
The Trout class' attempt to revisit this question comes too 
late, for it does not suggest that the court in Brown over-
looked material legislative history.  See generally Barry, 87 
F.3d 1389.  Not only does its claim of congressional intent to 
apply the 1991 amendments retroactively because the 1972 
amendments to the Civil Rights Act applied retroactively 
ignore Brown and previous holdings of this court, it finds no 
explication in the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  
The 1972 amendments, unlike the 1991 amendments, included 
"express congressional intent that [they were to] 'be applied 
to the fullest extent possible.' "  Tomasello v. Rubin, 167 
F.3d 612, 620 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 
684 F.2d 62, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1982));  see also Thompson v. 
Sawyer, 678 F.2d 257, 289 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Without lan-
guage to indicate such an intent, the court has declined to 
give the 1991 amendments the same retroactive application as 
the 1972 amendments.  Tomasello, 167 F.3d at 620.

     Accordingly, in light of the court's analysis of s 114(2) in 
Brown and the Supreme Court's instruction that a "statement 
that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not 
suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at 
an earlier date," Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 257, we hold that the 
district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest under 
s 114(2) on backpay and attorneys' fees for periods prior to 
November 21, 1991.  Because the Navy has paid interim 
attorneys' fees to counsel for the Trout class that is attribut-
able to litigation of the prejudgment interest dispute, and 
because the final amount of costs and fees remains to be 
determined, we remand the case to the district court for final 
determination of the costs and fees owed to the Trout class.
