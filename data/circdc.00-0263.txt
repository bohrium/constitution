     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Petitioner Mis-
souri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) seeks review of 
three orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC or Commission) setting initial rates for natural gas 
transportation by the Kansas Pipeline Company (KPC or 
Company).1  The petitioner argues that FERC failed to dem-
onstrate the approved rates are in the public interest, as 
required by section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 
U.S.C. s 717f, and failed to reach a conclusion that is the 
product of reasoned decisionmaking.  We agree.  According-
ly, we grant the petition for review and remand the case to 
the Commission for further ratemaking proceedings.

                                I.

     Section 7(c) of the NGA provides that "[n]o natural-gas 
company . . . shall engage in the transportation or sale of 
natural gas, . . . unless there is in force with respect to such 
natural-gas company a certificate of public convenience and 
__________
     1 The orders under review are Kansas Pipeline Co., 87 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,020 (Apr. 2, 1999);  Kansas Pipeline Co., 83 F.E.R.C. p 61,107 
(Apr. 30, 1998);  Kansas Pipeline Co., 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,250 (Nov. 25, 
1997).

necessity issued by the Commission authorizing such acts or 
operations."  15 U.S.C. s 717f(c).  In order to issue such a 
certificate, the Commission must find that, among other 
things, "the proposed service, sale, [or] operation . . . is or 
will be required by the present or future public convenience 
and necessity."  Id. s 717f(e).  Reaching this decision "re-
quires the Commission to evaluate all factors bearing on the 
public interest."  Atlantic Ref. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 
360 U.S. 378, 391 (1959).  More specifically, section 7 imposes 
on the Commission a duty "to engage in 'a most careful 
scrutiny and responsible reaction to initial price proposals of 
producers.'  That scrutiny demands attentiveness to the evi-
dence presented by the producer with 'price a consideration 
of prime importance' in the application of the public conve-
nience and necessity standard."  Consumer Fed'n of Am. v. 
Federal Power Comm'n, 515 F.2d 347, 356 (D.C. Cir.) (quot-
ing Atlantic Ref. Co., 360 U.S. at 391), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 
906 (1975).

                               II.

     KansOk Partnership (KansOk), Kansas Pipeline Partner-
ship (KPP) and Riverside Pipeline Company (Riverside) en-
gage in the transportation of natural gas.  Before November 
2, 1995 KPP was regulated by the Kansas Corporation Com-
mission (KCC),2 while KansOk and Riverside were regulated 
by FERC under section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act 
(NGPA), 15 U.S.C. s 3371.  On November 2, 1995 FERC 
determined that KansOk, KPP and Riverside constituted a 
single interstate pipeline system subject to FERC jurisdiction 
under the NGA.  See KansOk P'ship, 73 F.E.R.C. p 61,160, at 
61,480 (1995).  FERC therefore ordered the three entities, 
collectively KPC, to apply for a certificate of public conve-
nience and necessity under section 7 of the NGA.  See id. at 
61,488.  KPC challenged FERC's assertion of jurisdiction and 
sought a rehearing, see Kansas Pipeline Co., 81 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,005, at 61,006 (1997), but, at the same time, on January 

__________
     2 KPP operated as a "Hinshaw" pipeline exempt from FERC 
jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. s 717(c).

23, 1996 filed under protest a certificate application proposing 
an initial rate base of $100,647,042 and a cost of service of 
$36,708,843, see id. at 61,006-07, 61,017.

     On October 3, 1997 the Commission confirmed its Novem-
ber 2, 1995 decision asserting jurisdiction over KPC.3  See id. 
at 61,036.  FERC then proceeded to examine KPC's pro-
posed initial rates, terms and conditions and concluded that 
the rates were not in the public interest.  See id. at 61,017.  
In the end, FERC adopted a rate base of $39,011,785 and a 
cost of service of $21,817,483.  See id.

     On November 3, 1997 KPC sought rehearing of the October 
3, 1997 order.  The Company argued that the rates estab-
lished by the order would drive KPC into bankruptcy because 
they did not allow KPC to recover its operating expenses and 
make payments on two outstanding loans.  On November 10, 
1997 KPC sought a stay of the October 3, 1997 order, which 
the Commission granted on November 25, 1997.  See Kansas 
Pipeline Co., 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,250, at 62,136 (1997).

     On February 27, 1998 KPC filed with the Commission a 
document titled "Motion of Kansas Pipeline Company Acced-
ing to FERC Jurisdiction, and Requesting Interim Relief, Or, 
in the Alternative, Request for a Rehearing" in which it made 
the following proposal:  KPC would dismiss its appeal chal-
lenging FERC's jurisdiction, see supra note 3, if FERC 
permitted KPC to continue charging the contractual rates 
that had been agreed to by KPC and its customers and had 
been approved by KPC's prior regulators (Motion Rates) 
until such time as section 4 rates were approved by FERC.  
FERC agreed with KPC's proposal and on April 30, 1998 
issued an order permitting KPC to grandfather its old rates 
pending a section 4 proceeding.  See Kansas Pipeline Co., 83 
F.E.R.C. p 61,107, at 61,518 (1998).  In support of its decision 
FERC declared:  "As discussed below, the Commission has 
determined that granting the motion is in the public interest 

__________
     3 On December 2, 1997 KPC filed a petition for review with this 
court challenging FERC's decision.  See Kansas Pipeline P'ship v. 
FERC, No. 97-1710 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 2, 1997) (voluntarily dismissed 
on May 8, 1998).

because it will result in rates that are in the public interest, 
will remove the jurisdictional issue from the proceeding, and 
preserve the financial integrity of the applicant."  Id. at 
61,505.

     FERC's conclusion that the rates are "in the public inter-
est" warrants some explanation.  At the beginning of its 
analysis, the Commission noted that KPC's November 3, 1997 
request for rehearing of the October 3, 1997 order was 
"largely moot" in light of its approval of the Motion Rates.  
Nevertheless FERC proceeded to discuss the issues raised by 
the rehearing request in order to "provide a context for our 
decision to grant the applicant's February 27 motion."  Id. at 
61,506.  In the discussion, FERC reversed its October 3, 1997 
position on several issues.  See id. at 61,506-09.  Ultimately, 
FERC concluded that, if the initial rates set by the October 3, 
1997 order were adjusted "based on the rehearing arguments 
that the Commission found to be persuasive," those rates 
(Rehearing Rates) would be higher than KPC's Motion Rates.  
Id. at 61,511.  Because approval of the Motion Rates also 
resolved the jurisdictional issue, the Commission concluded 
that "it is in the public interest to grant Kansas Pipeline's 
motion."  Id.

     Petitioner MoPSC sought a rehearing of FERC's April 30, 
1998 order, challenging FERC's conclusion that the Rehear-
ing Rates would be higher than the Motion Rates.4  MoPSC 
asserted that FERC's analysis was plagued by numerous 
errors and unexplained departures from settled FERC po-
lices.  On April 2, 1999 FERC denied rehearing, explaining 
that in the April 30, 1998 order it had not relied strictly on a 
comparison of the Motion Rates and the Rehearing Rates but 
rather had "concluded that the motion rates were in the 
public interest because they were negotiated among the par-
ties and approved by the prior regulatory regime."  Kansas

     4 MoPSC has standing in this case pursuant to section 15 of the 
NGA.  See 15 U.S.C. s 717n ("In any proceeding before it, the 
Commission in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may 
prescribe, may admit as a party any interested . . . State commis-
sion, . . . whose participation in the proceeding may be in the public 
interest.");  see also 18 C.F.R. s 385.214 (FERC rules of practice 
and procedure).

Pipeline Co., 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,020, at 61,064 (1999).  FERC 
also emphasized the advantage of the Company's concession 
on the jurisdiction issue as well as the importance of preserv-
ing the Company's financial integrity.  See id. Unsatisfied, 
MoPSC filed this petition for review.

                               III.

     We review FERC's orders under the familiar arbitrary and 
capricious standard of the Administrative Procedure Act.  
See 5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A);  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline 
Co. v. FERC, 165 F.3d 54, 60 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Although 
"[j]udicial scrutiny under the National Gas Act is limited to 
assuring that the Commission's decisionmaking is reasoned, 
principled, and based upon the record," Columbia Gas Trans-
mission Corp. v. FERC, 628 F.2d 578, 593 (D.C. Cir. 1979);  
accord Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., 165 F.3d at 
60, the Commission's orders must nonetheless articulate "a 
rational connection between the facts found and the choice 
made."  Association of Oil Pipe Lines v. FERC, 83 F.3d 
1424, 1431 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citations and internal quotation 
marks omitted).  To carry out our reviewing task,

     it is imperative that the Commission articulate the criti-
     cal facts upon which it relies when it decides [the rele-
     vant rates].  Similarly, when the Commission finds it 
     necessary to make predictions or extrapolations from the 
     record, it must fully explain the assumptions it relied on 
     to resolve unknowns and the public policies behind those 
     assumptions.  Where the Commission balances compet-
     ing interests in arriving at its decision, it must explain on 
     the record the policies which guide it.  Only if the 
     Commission observes these minimum standards can we 
     be confident that missing facts, gross flaws in agency 
     reasoning, and statutorily irrelevant or prohibited policy 
     judgments will come to a reviewing court's attention.  
     Moreover, by requiring that the Commission fully articu-
     late the basis for its decision, we assure the Commission, 
     itself, the first opportunity to correct any defects which 
     may emerge from such disclosure.

v. FERC, 984 F.2d 426, 432 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

     Defending its approval of the Motion Rates as in the public 
interest, FERC asserts that it relied on the following 
grounds:  (1) approval of the Motion Rates ended the jurisdic-
tional dispute, thus eliminating regulatory uncertainty and 
avoiding protracted litigation;  (2) the Motion Rates had been 
negotiated among the parties;  (3) the Motion Rates had been 
approved by KPC's prior regulators;  (4) the Commission's 
adjustment of the October 3 rates preserved KPC's financial 
integrity and prevented KPC's bankruptcy;  and (5) the Mo-
tion Rates were lower than the Rehearing Rates.  MoPSC 
challenges each ground.5

     In evaluating the Commission's arguments, we bear in 
mind the "time-honored rule that a reviewing court 'must 
judge the propriety of [agency] action solely by the grounds 
invoked by the agency.' "  Western Resources, Inc. v. FERC, 
9 F.3d 1568, 1576 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting SEC v. Chenery 
Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947)).  The court does not "give an 
agency the benefit of a post hoc rationale of counsel."  Loui-
siana Ass'n of Indep. Producers & Royalty Owners v. FERC, 
958 F.2d 1101, 1123 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

     In our view, the record does not manifest that FERC 
originally invoked all of the grounds it now relies on to 

__________
     5 FERC argues that MoPSC is precluded from mounting a chal-
lenge to the first four grounds because it failed to make those 
arguments in its petition for rehearing as required by section 19(a) 
of the NGA.  See 15 U.S.C. s 717r(a) ("The application for rehear-
ing shall set forth specifically the ground or grounds upon which 
such application is based.").  We find no merit in FERC's argu-
ment.  As is clear from our discussion infra, the Commission's April 
30, 1998 order did not include all of the grounds it asserts here and, 
therefore, the petitioner had no reason to question unaddressed 
matters in seeking rehearing.  See 15 U.S.C. s 717r(b) ("No objec-
tion to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court 
unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission 
in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground 
for failure so to do." (emphasis added)).

support its action.  First, the Commission did not use the 
second and third rationales in its April 30, 1998 order.  
FERC's entire discussion of these two points is contained in 
one sentence:  "In its motion, [KPC] proposes to charge rates 
that have been negotiated among the parties and approved by 
the prior regulatory regime, until such time as the Commis-
sion directs [KPC] to file a NGA Section 4 rate case."  
Kansas Pipeline Co., 83 F.E.R.C. p 61,107, at 61,510.  The 
order does not explain the significance of the two rationales 
or how they relate to the choice made by the Commission.  
Moreover, FERC's own conclusion shows no reliance on these 
factors.6  Thus, we reach the inescapable conclusion that 
FERC's reference to the negotiations among parties and to 
the approval by prior regulators was merely descriptive of the 
Motion Rates rather than a declaration of what FERC now 
argues are two of its primary reasons for reaching its deci-
sion.

     As to the first and fourth rationales, the April 30, 1998 
order does include them as grounds for the decision.  See 
Kansas Pipeline Co., 83 F.E.R.C. p 61,107, at 61,505 ("[T]he 
Commission has determined that granting the motion . . . 
will remove the jurisdictional issue from the proceeding, and 
preserve the financial integrity of the applicant.").  A passing 
reference to relevant factors, however, is not sufficient to 
satisfy the Commission's obligation to carry out "reasoned" 
and "principled" decisionmaking.  We have repeatedly re-
quired the Commission to "fully articulate the basis for its 
decision."  Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 628 F.2d at 

__________
     6 FERC's conclusion reads:

     A comparison of [the Rehearing Rates] with the proposed 
     motion rates shows that the combined motion rates for the 
     three zones are lower.  In addition, approving the motion rates 
     would remove the jurisdictional issue from the proceeding, 
     since [KPC] has agreed to accede to federal jurisdiction if its 
     motion is granted.  Under these circumstances, the Commis-
     sion concludes that it is in the public interest to grant [KPC's] 
     motion.

F.2d at 432;  City of Charlottesville v. FERC 661 F.2d 945, 
950 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  Here, the Commission fell short of 
meeting the "minimum standards" with which it is required to 
comply.  Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 628 F.2d at 593.

     Having addressed the first four rationales upon which the 
Commission relies on appeal, we turn now to the Commis-
sion's hypothetical calculation of the Rehearing Rates.  The 
April 30, 1998 order concludes that the Motion Rates are 
lower than the rates FERC would have approved had it 
granted a rehearing.  See Kansas Pipeline Co., 83 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,107, at 61,511.  The record makes clear this was the 
Commission's primary reason for approving the Motion 
Rates.  Nevertheless, both in its April 2, 1999 order and 
before this court, FERC has avoided defending its computa-
tion of the Rehearing Rates, dismissing it as mere "context."  
See Kansas Pipeline Co., 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,020, at 61,064.  
Indeed, during oral argument, FERC counsel could not even 
assure this court that the Commission's arithmetic in calculat-
ing the adjusted hypothetical cost of service was correct.  
Given that the only record basis on which FERC's decision 
could be affirmed is minimized by the Commission itself, we 
are compelled to remand the case to the Commission so that 
it can reach a conclusion that is the product of reasoned 
decisionmaking.7

__________
     7 In view of the Commission's own limited defense of its calcula-
tions, we need not reach the merits of MoPSC's related calculations 
arguments (e.g., rate of return computation, debt prepayment treat-
ment, reliance on stale data) raised in its request for rehearing of 
the April 30, 1998 order.  On remand, if the Commission decides to 
recalculate the Rehearing Rates, it should consider MoPSC's argu-
ments and, if it chooses to depart from existing applicable ratemak-
ing policies, it must explain its reasoning on the record.  See Great 
Lakes Gas Transmission Ltd. P'ship, 984 F.2d at 433 ("A full and 
rational explanation is especially important to this court when the 
condition imposed reflects a shift in FERC's policy or a departure 
from its typical manner of granting certificates and imposing condi-
tions.").

     We note, however, that our decision does not mean that at 
least some of the rationales offered by FERC could not 
support the approval of initial section 7 rates pending a 
section 4 proceeding.  See Atlantic Ref. Co., 360 U.S. at 391 
(approval of certificate of public convenience and necessity 
"requires the Commission to evaluate all factors bearing on 
the public interest");  Tejas Power Corp. v. FERC, 908 F.2d 
998, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("[T]his court has consistently 
required the Commission to give weight to the contracts and 
settlements of the parties before it.") (citing Union Elec. Co. 
v. FERC, 890 F.2d 1193, 1194-95 (1989));  Jersey Cent. Power 
& Light Co. v. FERC, 810 F.2d 1168, 1177-78 (D.C. Cir. 1987) 
("In reviewing a rate order courts must determine whether or 
not the end result of that order constitutes a reasonable 
balancing, based on factual findings, of the investor interest in 
maintaining financial integrity and access to capital markets 
and the consumer interest in being charged non-exploitative 
rates.");  cf. Arctic Slope Regional Corp. v. FERC, 832 F.2d 
158, 167-68 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (upholding FERC decision that 
termination of lengthy litigation served public interest).  In 
this case, however, the rationales fail because FERC has not 
adequately explained how the rationales, alone or together, 
satisfy the "public interest" standard of section 7.

     For the foregoing reasons, we remand to FERC for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
