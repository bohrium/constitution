     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  This is an appeal of an award of 
attorney's fees for actions brought under the Freedom of 
Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. s 552, and the Govern-
ment in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. s 552b.  The question is 
whether Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virgi-
nia Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598 (2001), 
decided while this appeal was pending, applies to FOIA cases.

                                I.

     Congress created the United States Enrichment Corpora-
tion ("USEC") to operate uranium enrichment plants in the 
country.  See 42 U.S.C. s 2297a (1992).  There are two such 
facilities, one in Kentucky, the other in Ohio.  The Oil, 
Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union repre-
sented employees at both plants.  In 1996, Congress decided 
to "privatize" USEC by having a private entity lease the 
facilities.  See USEC Privatization Act, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 
110 Stat. 1321-335 (1996) (codified at 42 U.S.C. s 2297h).  
Concerned that privatization would affect its members' em-
ployment, the union sought information about what was 
planned.  USEC refused to provide the information voluntari-
ly.  The union then sent a FOIA request to USEC.  On June 
30, 1998, after USEC failed to provide the information, the 
union filed this action in the district court.  A few weeks later 
the union brought a separate suit under the Government in 
the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. s 552b, seeking to open USEC's 
board meetings on privatization to the public.  The district 

court denied the union's request for a temporary restraining 
order that would have required an "open" board meeting.  
Privatization occurred a few weeks later, on July 28, 1998.

     In August 1998, the government moved to dismiss the 
FOIA and Sunshine Act suits, arguing that the court's juris-
diction ended when USEC ceased to be a public entity.  
Rather than grant the motion, the district court substituted 
the Department of Energy as defendant on the grounds that 
the Privatization Act called for the government to fulfill 
obligations incurred by USEC, and that there was a "Record 
Agreement" to the same effect.  Several status hearings took 
place after this order.  On December 10, 1999, the parties 
(the union and the Energy Department) filed a Stipulation 
and Order of Dismissal stating that the government had 
provided "substantial amounts of material" and dismissing the 
claims with prejudice, although reserving the union's right to 
seek attorney's fees.  The district court endorsed the stipula-
tion.

     The parties were unable to resolve the attorney's fees issue 
amongst themselves, so the union filed an application for fees 
with the district court on April 17, 2000.  On March 16, 2001, 
the court ruled that the union was entitled to receive fees, but 
not in the full amount it sought.  (The court stated that the 
union could recover any Sunshine Act fees in its motion for 
fees under FOIA, but it also denied the union's request for 
fees related to its failed attempt to get injunctive relief 
halting the USEC board meeting or opening it to the public.  
The union does not appeal this decision, so our analysis is 
limited to the request for fees under FOIA.)  After the 
court's order, the parties stipulated that the proper amount of 
fees and costs totaled $108,173.25, reserving the Energy 
Department's right to appeal.  The court ordered the pay-
ment of this amount on March 30, 2001.  Shortly after the 
government noted its appeal, the Supreme Court issued its 
opinion in Buckhannon, holding that attorney's fees are not 
authorized under the Fair Housing Amendments Act or 
Americans with Disabilities Act to a plaintiff who achieves the 
desired result without a judgment on the merits or a court-
ordered consent decree.  See 532 U.S. at 600-01.

                               II.

     In order to recover attorney's fees in a FOIA case, the 
plaintiff must have "substantially prevailed":  the "court may 
assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and 
other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under 
this section in which the complainant has substantially pre-
vailed."  5 U.S.C. s 552(a)(4)(E).  In determining whether 
plaintiffs are eligible for an award, we have followed the 
"catalyst theory."  So long as the "litigation substantially 
caused the requested records to be released," the FOIA 
plaintiff could recover attorney's fees even though the district 
court had not rendered a judgment in the plaintiff's favor.  
Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. Dep't of Agric., 11 F.3d 211, 
216 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citing Vermont Low Income Advocacy 
Council, Inc. v. Usery, 546 F.2d 509, 513 (2d Cir. 1976));  see 
also Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, 553 F.2d 1360, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1977).

     In Buckhannon, the Supreme Court rejected the "catalyst 
theory."  Plaintiffs there had alleged that certain "self-
preservation" provisions of a state fire code violated the Fair 
Housing Amendments and Americans with Disabilities Acts 
as applied to an assisted-living facility.  See 532 U.S. at 600.  
Before the district court ruled, the state legislature repealed 
the provisions.  See id. at 601.  Plaintiffs then moved for 
attorney's fees, arguing that under the fee-shifting statutes at 
issue they were "prevailing parties" because their lawsuit had 
prompted the change in the law.  See id.  The Supreme 
Court held that absent some sort of judicial imprimatur, a 
plaintiff could not be considered a "prevailing party" and an 
award of attorney's fees was therefore impermissible.

     The Energy Department argues that Buckhannon's rejec-
tion of the catalyst theory applies also to FOIA, a possibility 
we have already noticed.  See Students Against Genocide v. 
Dep't of State, 257 F.3d 828, 841 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  As the 
Court pointed out in Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 602-03, there 
are dozens of fee-shifting statutes, some worded slightly 
differently from others.  A wide range of statutes uses the 
"substantially prevails" formulation.  See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 
s 552a(g)(2)(B) (Privacy Act);  5 U.S.C. s 552b(i) (Govern-

ment in the Sunshine Act);  15 U.S.C. s 26 (Clayton Act);  16 
U.S.C. s 470w-4 (National Historic Preservation Act);  28 
U.S.C. s 2465(b)(1) (return of forfeited or condemned proper-
ty);  42 U.S.C. s 300aa-31(c) (National Vaccine Injury Com-
pensation Program).  Many other statutes use "prevailing 
party."  As to a litigant's eligibility for an award of attorney's 
fees, we have treated these statutes as substantially similar.  
See, e.g., Pub. Citizen Health Research Group v. Young, 909 
F.2d 546, 549 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Equal Access to Justice Act) 
("It is enough that the lawsuit was a 'causal, necessary, or 
substantial factor in obtaining the result' plaintiff sought.");  
Comm'rs Court of Medina County, Tex. v. United States, 683 
F.2d 435, 442 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (Voting Rights Act).  Buckhan-
non expressly endorsed this approach.  After citing to a long 
list of such statutes, a list including FOIA, the Court stated 
that it had "interpreted these fee-shifting statutes consistent-
ly," 532 U.S. at 603 & n.4 (citing Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 
43-51 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting);  
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 n.7 (1983)).  Five 
circuits have applied Buckhannon to other fee-shifting stat-
utes.  See, e.g., Smyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 274-76 (4th 
Cir. 2002) (42 U.S.C. s 1988);  Perez-Arellano v. Smith, 279 
F.3d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 2002) (Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 
U.S.C. s 2412(d)(1)(A));  J.C. v. Reg'l Sch. Dist. 10, 278 F.3d 
119, 124 (2d Cir. 2002) (Individuals with Disabilities in Edu-
cation Act, 20 U.S.C. s 1415(i)(3)(B));  N.Y. State Fed'n of 
Taxi Drivers, Inc. v. Westchester County Taxi & Limousine 
Comm'n, 272 F.3d 154, 158 (2d Cir. 2001) (42 U.S.C. s 1988);  
Chambers v. Ohio Dep't of Human Servs., 273 F.3d 690, 693 
& n.1 (6th Cir. 2001) (42 U.S.C. s 1983);  Crabill v. Trans 
Union, L.L.C., 259 F.3d 662, 667 (7th Cir. 2001) (Fair Credit 
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. ss 1681n, 1681o);  cf. Bennett v. 
Yoshina, 259 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 2001) ("There can be 
no doubt that the Court's analysis in Buckhannon applies to 
statutes other than the two at issue in that case.").

     We therefore adhere to the proposition, well-established in 
this court and in the Supreme Court, that eligibility for an 
award of attorney's fees in a FOIA case should be treated the 
same as eligibility determinations made under other fee-

shifting statutes unless there is some good reason for doing 
otherwise.  One such reason, the union argues, is the contrast 
between the language of the statutes in Buckhannon, which 
authorized fees for the "prevailing party," see 42 U.S.C. 
ss 3613(c)(2) & 12205, and FOIA, which allows fees if "the 
complainant has substantially prevailed."  5 U.S.C. 
s 552(a)(4)(E).  It is true, as the union points out, that 
Buckhannon treated "prevailing party" as a "legal term of 
art."  532 U.S. at 603.  Yet all must agree that a "prevailing 
party" and a "party who prevails" are synonymous.  FOIA's 
addition of the modifier "substantially" might possibly be 
taken as limiting the category of "prevailing parties," but it 
cannot be taken as expanding the universe of parties eligible 
for a fee award.  To put this in concrete terms, a FOIA 
plaintiff may seek thousands of documents but wind up with a 
judgment providing only a handful of insignificant documents.  
One might say this plaintiff was a prevailing party, but 
nevertheless not say that the plaintiff substantially prevailed.  
Cf. Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 
489 U.S. 782, 789-92 (1989) (discussing "significance" as it 
pertains to the definition of "prevailing party").  We have 
seen nothing to suggest that Congress sought to draw any 
fine distinction between "prevailing party" and "substantially 
prevail."  The Internal Revenue Code, for instance, defines 
"prevailing party" to mean a party who has "substantially 
prevailed."  26 U.S.C. s 7430(c)(4)(A).  Consistent with our 
practice (and the Supreme Court's) of viewing the various fee-
shifting statutes as interchangeable, we have in the past 
treated the "substantially prevail" language in FOIA as the 
functional equivalent of the "prevailing party" language found 
in other statutes.  See Foster v. Boorstin, 561 F.2d 340, 342 
(D.C. Cir. 1977).

     The union also maintains that since FOIA cases are equita-
ble in nature, the limitations imposed in Buckhannon are not 
appropriate.  Judge Friendly made the argument forcefully 
in an influential opinion:

     To take an extreme example, Congress clearly did not 
     mean that where an FOIA suit had gone to trial and 
     
     developments made it apparent that the judge was about 
     to rule for the plaintiff, the Government could abort any 
     award of attorney fees by an eleventh hour tender of the 
     information requested.
     
Vermont Low Income Advocacy Council, 546 F.2d at 513.  
But FOIA cases are not unique in this respect.  There are 
many potential actions in which the "prevailing party" may 
sue for injunctive relief or for damages and an injunction.  
See, e.g., Wagshal v. Foster, 28 F.3d 1249, 1251 (D.C. Cir. 
1994) (plaintiff seeking damages and injunctive relief under 42 
U.S.C. s 1983).  It is hard to believe that Congress would 
have intended to create a system in which a "prevailing 
party" would be eligible to recover fees for the injunction 
portion of the lawsuit but not for the damages portion.  The 
Supreme Court in Buckhannon considered a problem similar 
to that posed by Judge Friendly but refused to limit its 
holding to actions at law.  532 U.S. at 608-10.  In the Court's 
view, policy arguments could not carry the day because the 
meaning of "prevailing party" was clear.  See id. at 610.

     The union also sees a distinction between FOIA cases and 
Buckhannon stemming from FOIA's legislative history.  The 
argument is that Congress intended FOIA's attorney's fee 
provision to be understood differently from comparable provi-
sions in other statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities 
Act.  The history leading to passage of FOIA is thoroughly 
surveyed in Judge Friendly's opinion in Vermont Low Income 
Advocacy Council.  See 546 F.2d at 512-13.  The original 
House bill made a plaintiff's eligibility for an award of fees 
turn on whether the court had issued an injunction against 
the government.  See id. at 512.  The final House bill condi-
tioned eligibility on the government's not prevailing.  See id.  
The Senate bill contained the "substantially prevailed" lan-
guage, along with a list of factors for the court to consider in 
determining whether to make an award.  See id.  The accom-
panying Senate report talked about eligibility for attorney's 
fees in cases in which the plaintiffs had successfully proven 
that the government had wrongfully withheld information.  
See id. at 512.  The final version, as it emerged from confer-
ence, deleted the Senate's list of factors.  See id. at 513.  

With great respect to Judge Friendly, on whose opinion we 
relied in Cuneo, 553 F.2d at 1364 & nn.3-8, this record is 
inconclusive.  None of the Committee reports mentions 
awarding fees in the absence of a judgment.  And both the 
House and the Senate reports contain statements suggesting 
that the FOIA provision was modeled after fee-shifting provi-
sions allowing fees for a "prevailing party," which further 
supports treating FOIA no differently than the statutes inter-
preted in Buckhannon.  See H.R. Rep. No. 93-876 (1974), 
reprinted in Legislative History of the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, 1974 Amendments 126-27 & n.10 (1975);  S. Rep. No. 
93-854 (1974), reprinted in Legislative History, supra, at 
170.

     We therefore hold that in order for plaintiffs in FOIA 
actions to become eligible for an award of attorney's fees, 
they must have "been awarded some relief by [a] court," 
either in a judgment on the merits or in a court-ordered 
consent decree.  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 603.  Because 
Buckhannon controls, the existing law of our circuit must 
give way.  See Benavides v. Bureau of Prisons, 993 F.2d 257, 
258-59 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reversing circuit precedent on the 
eligibility of a pro se FOIA plaintiff for attorney's fees in light 
of Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 438 (1991), a case arising 
under 42 U.S.C. s 1988).

                               III.

     The union claims that even if Buckhannon applies, we 
should sustain the award because the parties received a 
"court-ordered settlement."  The Department of Energy be-
came a defendant on March 18, 1999.  The parties agreed to 
dismiss the case on December 10, 1999.  In the interim, the 
district court had issued three orders.  The first, entered on 
March 31, 1999, ordered the government to review the docu-
ments the union sought and to submit a "joint report with a 
proposed schedule" no later than July 10, 1999.  The parties 
timely filed the joint report, stating that the Energy Depart-
ment had reviewed the 4,000 documents and that "to the 
greatest extent possible, the parties wish to resolve this case 

without further contested proceedings."  The court's second 
order directed the parties to submit another "status report" 
by August 20, 1999.  The parties' second report stipulated 
that, "[s]ubject to the approval of the Court," the government 
had provided most of the materials the union had requested, 
that it would search for the remaining items and release any 
that did not merit withholding under FOIA's exemptions, and 
that the union was dismissing its case with prejudice except 
for the remaining items.  The parties reiterated that they 
"wish[ed] to resolve this case to the greatest extent possible 
without further contested proceedings" and asked for leave of 
the court to continue negotiations until December 8, 1999.  
The court signed the document, which carried the heading 
"Stipulation and Order."  It is clear from the record that to 
this point the court had not rendered any judgment about the 
legality of the government's withholding any information and 
that the parties had been attempting to resolve the case 
through negotiation.  See, e.g., 3/31/99 Tr. at 9:19-23 ("I'll 
certainly read the joint report as soon as it comes in, and ... 
I'll either sign off on what you've given me or set up a 
conference call or an in-court status to resolve things final-
ly.").

     On December 10, 1999, the court approved the parties' final 
status report as a "Stipulation and Order" stating in its 
entirety:

     Subject to the approval of the Court, it is hereby stipu-
     lated and agreed as follows by and between the under-
     signed:
     
     1. In light of defendant's production of substantial 
     amounts of material responsive to plaintiff's claim for 
     relief in this action, the action is hereby dismissed with 
     prejudice and, except as provided in p 2, without fees or 
     costs.
     
     2. The dismissal of this action shall be without prejudice 
     to the right of plaintiff to obtain in [this case], an award 
     of attorney's fees and litigation costs covering work 
     performed in this action.
     
This order did not constitute a decision on the merits;  the 
court had no contested issues before it.  The "Stipulation and 
Order" approved the parties' terms of dismissal, but this was 
merely a formality.  An "action may be dismissed ... without 
order of the court ... by filing a stipulation of dismissal 
signed by" all of the parties.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1).

     The union claims that since the court signed the order, it is 
a "court-ordered consent decree[ ]."  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. 
at 604.  By this term, the Supreme Court meant "a court 
'ordered chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between [the 
plaintiff] and the defendant.' "  Id. (quoting Tex. State Teach-
ers Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792);  see also Smyth, 282 F.3d at 278-
82 & n.11 (discussing the meaning of a "consent decree" in 
the Buckhannon context).  The Court distinguished private 
settlements, which do not create a " 'material alteration of the 
legal relationship of the parties' necessary to permit an award 
of attorney's fees."  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604 & n.7 
(quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792-93).  The 
discussion in Buckhannon also makes clear that there must 
be some sort of "judicial relief" in favor of the party seeking 
an award of fees.  See 532 U.S. at 606, 607 n.9;  id. at 622 
(Scalia, J., concurring).

     The December 10 Stipulation and Order of Dismissal did 
not meaningfully alter the legal relationship of the parties.  
Its only effect was to dismiss the union's lawsuit with a court 
order when no court order was needed.  That cannot repre-
sent "judicial relief" for the union.  Aside from the union's 
attorney fee request, there was nothing left for the district 
court to oversee.  This contrasts with the consent decree in 
Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 126 (1980), which increased 
AFDC allowances and gave recipients the right to prove that 
their individual expenses exceeded the standard levels.  The 
decree in Maher constituted "judicial relief" that "materially 
altered" the rights of the parties:  for example, it estopped 
the government from refusing to disburse benefits in excess 
of the standard level to an individual who demonstrated the 
requisite personal expense level.  Had the December 10 
stipulation between the union and the Energy Department 
outlined documents the government still needed to disclose to 

the union, matters might be different.  But the parties stipu-
lated that the union had received enough information to 
forego continuation of its lawsuit.

     Our dissenting colleague thinks that the district court's 
endorsement of the August 23, 1999, stipulation qualifies as a 
"settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree."  
Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604.  The union's brief never made 
this argument.  It argued instead that the court's denial of 
the Energy Department's motion to dismiss changed the legal 
relationship of the parties.  Neither the union's argument, 
nor the dissent's attempt to salvage the union's case, are 
correct.  Surviving a motion to dismiss does not alter the 
legal relationship between parties.  See Hanrahan v. Hamp-
ton, 446 U.S. 754, 758 (1980).  The dissent's focus on the 
August 23, 1999, stipulation ignores the interim nature of that 
order, which is properly viewed as a procedural ruling that 
cannot serve as the basis for a determination that the union 
prevailed.  See id. at 759.  The only part of the order which 
arguably changed the legal status of the parties was the 
requirement that the Energy Department complete its record 
review in 60 days.  Before August 23, the court had not 
ordered the Energy Department to turn over any documents;  
after August 23, the Energy Department still had no obli-
gation to do so.  Both before and after August 23 the district 
court did not disallow any of the Energy Department's justifi-
cations for exempting documents, or portions of documents, 
from disclosure.  This is not judicial relief on the merits of 
the union's complaint.  Contrast Maher, 448 U.S. at 126 
(settlement agreement required government to pay higher 
AFDC benefits to plaintiffs).  The dissent theorizes that the 
August order prompted the Department to turn over enough 
information so that by December the parties could agree to 
dismiss the case.  In other words, filing the lawsuit and 
receiving some scheduling orders served as a catalyst result-
ing in the relief the union sought.  Even if the dissent's 
assessment had any proof behind it (it seems equally plausi-
ble that the Energy Department simply lacked the time to 
review the items), Buckhannon clearly instructs that we are 
not to analyze "the defendant's subjective motivations in 

changing its conduct."  532 U.S. at 609.  Instead, we are to 
look for some form of "judicial relief," and it is clear that the 
union received none.

     Under the rule of Buckhannon, the union therefore was not 
entitled to attorney's fees because it did not "substantially 
prevail."

                                                                 Reversed.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  Today the court decides 
whether the Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board 
and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health 
and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), applies to suits 
for attorney's fees under the Freedom of Information Act 
("FOIA").  See Opinion at 2.  Even assuming that the answer 
to this question is in the affirmative, there are two separate 
problems with the court's opinion.  The first involves the 
suggestion that the Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon 
bars attorney's fees in the absence of a final judgment on the 
merits or a consent decree embodying a settlement.  To 
reach this interpretation of Buckhannon, the court, contrary 
to the other circuits, glosses over the holding and underlying 
rationale of Buckhannon.  The second problem arises from 
the court's failure to acknowledge the plain terms of the 
district court's order to the government to turn over docu-
ments that Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International 
Union ("OCAW") sought under FOIA and that the govern-
ment had previously withheld.

                                I.

     The holding and rationale of the Supreme Court in Bu- 
ckhannon is hardly as broad as some of the court's language 
today suggests.  The Supreme Court stated its holding as 
follows:  "[W]e hold that the 'catalyst theory' is not a permis-
sible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the [Fair 
Housing Amendments Act of 1988], 42 U.S.C. s 3613(c)(2), 
and [the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990], 42 U.S.C. 
s 12205."  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 610.  The reasons that 
the Court gave were as follows.  The Court first noted that 
the term "prevailing party" is a legal term of art that means 
"one who has been awarded some relief by the court."  Id. at 
603.  The Court then explained that its precedent was consis-
tent with this meaning.  Reviewing its previous decisions 
addressing the meaning of "prevailing party," the court ex-
plained that in addition to a judgment on the merits by the 
court, see id. at 603-04 (citing Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 
U.S. 754, 758 (1980) (per curiam);  Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 

755, 760 (1987);  and Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992)), 
settlement agreements enforced through a court-ordered con-
sent decree may also serve as the basis for an award of 
attorney's fees.  Id. at 604 (citing Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 
122 (1980)).  Although consent decrees need not contain a 
defendant's admission of liability, the Court viewed them as a 
court-ordered " 'chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between 
[the plaintiff] and the defendant.' "  Id. (quoting Tex. State 
Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 
792 (1989)) (alterations in the original).  The Court also 
distinguished consent decrees from private settlements, not-
ing that "[p]rivate settlements do not entail the judicial 
approval and oversight involved in consent decrees[, a]nd 
federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement 
will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are 
incorporated into the order of dismissal."  Id. at 604 n.7 
(citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 
375 (1994)).

     Finding a common thread in its precedent, the Court in 
effect established a line:  a party prevails only upon obtaining 
a "judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the 
parties."  Id. at 605.  On one side of the line, the Court 
observed that its precedent reveals that "enforceable judg-
ments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create 
the 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties' 
necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees."  Id. at 604 
(quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792-93).  The 
Court then held that the " 'catalyst theory' falls on the other 
side of the line from these examples" because "[i]t allows an 
award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the 
legal relationship of the parties."  Id. at 605.  The Court 
explained that "[a] defendant's voluntary change in conduct, 
although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to 
achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprima-
tur on the change."  Id.

     The Supreme Court's holding and rationale in Buckhannon 
do not limit attorney's fees awards to cases in which there is 
either a final judgment on the merits or a consent decree.  
Rather than define these two forms of relief as the only 

instances in which there could be a "prevailing party" for 
purposes of recovering attorney's fees, the Court used these 
forms of relief as discrete examples, illustrated by its prece-
dent, in which the need for "judicial imprimatur on the 
change" in the parties' legal relationship is present.  Id.  As 
the factual setting before the Supreme Court makes clear, the 
Court did not have the occasion to provide an exhaustive list 
of the various forms of judicial relief that the plaintiff must 
obtain in order to be a "prevailing party" for purposes of an 
award of attorney's fees.  In Buckhannon, the petitioner's 
suit for declaratory and injunctive relief coincided with the 
State legislature's subsequent repeal of the allegedly offend-
ing statute, and the district court thereafter dismissed the 
lawsuit as moot.  Id. at 601.  There was no judicial involve-
ment in the resolution of the litigation.  Petitioners, however, 
sought attorney's fees as prevailing parties under the FHAA 
and the ADA on the theory that the lawsuit had served as a 
catalyst of the repeal.  Id.  Not having any occasion to 
consider the precise contours of the necessary judicial impri-
matur on the change in the legal relationship of the parties, 
the Supreme Court did not need to, and in fact did not, seize 
the opportunity to explain more than that the "catalyst theo-
ry" as applied on the facts before the Court -- where there 
was no judicial involvement in the resolution -- was not 
enough.

     Indeed, the Supreme Court's review of its precedents dem-
onstrates that the Court did not establish a finite list of the 
forms of judicial relief that are necessary to "prevail."  Rath-
er, as described by the Court, on one side of the line, where 
there is a "prevailing party" for purposes of recovering 
attorney's fees, is precedent holding that judgments on the 
merits and consent decrees are sufficient to give rise to 
prevailing party status.  See id. at 605-06 (discussing Farrar, 
506 U.S. at 112;  and Maher, 448 U.S. at 129-30).  On the 
other side of the line, the Court, again looking to its prece-
dent, indicated only that preliminary victories such as with-
standing a motion for a directed verdict or a motion for 
summary judgment for failure to state a cause of action were 
insufficient.  Id. at 605-06 (citing Hewitt, 482 U.S. at 760;  

and Hanrahan, 446 U.S. at 759).  Although the Court in 
Buckhannon only specifically listed a judgment on the merits 
or a court-ordered consent decree as examples on the other 
side of the prevailing party line, id. at 606 (citing Farrar, 506 
U.S. at 112;  and Maher, 448 U.S. at 129-30), attorney's fees 
could be awarded in other circumstances.  For example, two 
members of the majority noted that court-approved settle-
ments in addition to consent decrees bore the necessary 
judicial imprimatur.  Id. at 618 (Scalia, J., concurring, joined 
by Thomas, J.).  Additionally, in Hanrahan, cited with ap-
proval in Buckhannon, the Court acknowledged that "[t]he 
legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards 
Act of 1976 [s 1988] indicates that a person may in some 
circumstances be a 'prevailing party' without having obtained 
a favorable 'final judgment following a full trial on the mer-
its.' "  Hanrahan, 446 U.S. at 756-57 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 
94-1558, at 7 (1976)).  The House Committee Report indicat-
ed that Congress had adopted the approach that the Court 
had taken in Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 
696 (1974), in which the Court stated that " 'the entry of any 
order that determines substantial rights of the parties may be 
an appropriate occasion upon which to consider the propriety 
of an award of counsel fees....' "  Hanrahan, 446 U.S. at 
757 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8 (quoting Bradley, 
416 U.S. at 723 n.28)).  The Senate Committee Report stated 
that "the award of counsel fees pendente lite would be 
'especially appropriate where a party has prevailed on an 
important matter in the course of litigation, even when he 
ultimately does not prevail on all issues.' "  Id. (quoting 
S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (1976)).  From this history, the 
Court concluded:

     It seems apparent from these passages that Congress 
     intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only 
     when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some 
     of his claims.  For only in that event has there been a 
     determination of the "substantial rights of the parties," 
     which Congress determined was a necessary foundation 
     for departing from the usual rule in this country that 
     each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney.
     
Id. at 757-58.  Nothing in Buckhannon suggests that the 
Court has overruled this precedent;  rather, the Court only 
clarified that the catalyst theory fell on the other side of the 
line of this precedent.

     The circuits that have addressed Buckhannon have not 
read it to be as broad a bar to attorney's fees as the court 
suggests today.  Several circuits have confronted a pure 
catalyst theory claim and naturally read Buckhannon to bar 
such awards of attorney's fees, notwithstanding the fee provi-
sion at issue.  See, e.g., Perez-Arellano v. Smith, 279 F.3d 
791, 795 (9th Cir. 2002) (Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 
U.S.C. s 2412(d)(1)(A));  Chambers v. Ohio Dep't of Human 
Servs., 273 F.3d 690, 693 (6th Cir. 2001) (Civil Rights Act, 42 
U.S.C. s 1988).  However, when confronted with a private 
settlement, the Ninth Circuit in Barrios v. California Inter-
scholastic Federation, 277 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2002) (Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. s 12205), upheld 
the award in light of circuit precedent and limited Buckhan-
non's holding to the rejection of the catalyst theory, describ-
ing as mere dictum the Supreme Court's rejection of private 
settlements as sufficient to provide prevailing party status.  
Id. at 1134 n.5.  See also Johnson v. District of Columbia, 
190 F. Supp. 2d 34, 45 & n.3 (D.D.C. 2002) (Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. s 1415(i)(3)(B)).  But 
see Perez-Arellano, 279 F.3d at 793-94 (Equal Access to 
Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. s 2412(d)(1)(A)).

     Other circuits, taking a less narrow reading of Buckhannon 
than the Ninth Circuit, have nonetheless recognized that 
Buckhannon has a limited holding in two respects.  First, the 
circuits have looked at the particular attorney's fees statute 
at issue to determine whether Buckhannon's interpretation of 
"prevailing party" applies.  For example, the Tenth Circuit in 
Center for Biological Diversity v. Norton, 262 F.3d 1077 (10th 
Cir. 2001), declined to apply Buckhannon to the attorney's 
fees provision of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 
s 1540(g)(4), which did not require that there be a "prevailing 
party" and left the decision to award fees to the discretion of 
the district court.  Id. at 1080 n.2.  Other circuits considering 

other statutes have also treated this as a threshold question 
in applying Buckhannon's reasoning.  In Crabill v. Trans 
Union, L.L.C., 259 F.3d 662 (7th Cir. 2001), for example, the 
Seventh Circuit concluded upon examining the text, structure, 
and legislative history of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 
U.S.C. ss 1681o & 1681n, that the reasoning of Buckhannon 
applied.  Id. at 666-67.  The Federal Court of Claims, in 
Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 738 
(2001), on the other hand, limited Buckhannon to the statutes 
cited by the Court and declined to apply Buckhannon to the 
Equal Access to Justice Act.  Id. at 744-47.

     Second, the circuits have looked beyond whether the relief 
obtained was either a judgment on the merits or a consent 
decree and instead have looked for action compelled by the 
court, focusing on the underlying concern of the Supreme 
Court in Buckhannon that there be some "judicial imprima-
tur on the change" in the parties' legal status.  As the 
Seventh Circuit explained in Crabill in rejecting a claim of 
entitlement to attorney's fees in the absence of any judicially 
ordered relief, "[t]he significance of the Buckhannon decision 
... [is] its insistence that a plaintiff must obtain formal 
judicial relief, and not merely 'success,' in order to be deemed 
a prevailing or successful party under any attorneys' fee 
provision comparable to the civil rights attorneys' fee stat-
ute."  Crabill, 259 F.3d at 666.  Thus, the Second Circuit in 
J.C. v. Regional School District 10, Board of Education, 278 
F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 2002), in addressing fee awards under the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 
s 1415(i)(3)(B), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 
s 794a(b), considered whether the relief received by the 
plaintiff was more akin to a judicial consent decree or a 
private settlement, and concluded that statutorily required 
relief could not be a substitute for a judicial order or decree 
under Buckhannon.  Id. at 125.  Likewise, the Fourth Cir-
cuit in Smyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268 (4th Cir. 2002), applying 
s 1988, considered whether the two forms of relief obtained 
by the plaintiff constituted sufficient judicial relief to trigger 
prevailing party status in Buckhannon by examining on 
which side of the Buckhannon line the relief fell.  Id. at 274-

75.  Concluding that the preliminary injunction plaintiffs 
obtained was more akin to the judicial relief deemed inade-
quate in Buckhannon because it was a "preliminary, incom-
plete ... merits examination," id. at 277, the Fourth Circuit 
examined whether an agreement between the parties that 
was referenced in the district court's final order of dismissal 
was sufficient to show entitlement to attorney's fees.  Id. at 
273-74, 284.  Observing that Buckhannon indicated that "a 
determination of 'legal merit' is necessary for an award of 
attorney's fees," id. at 281 (quoting Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 
605), and that the Supreme Court's focus was on "judicial 
approval and oversight involved in consent decrees," id. at 
281-82 (quoting Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604 n.7) (internal 
quotation marks omitted), the Fourth Circuit declined to read 
Buckhannon "so restrictively as to require that the words 
'consent decree' be used explicitly," and instead concluded 
that an order containing an agreement of the parties may be 
the functional equivalent of a consent decree for purposes of 
the Buckhannon inquiry.  Id. at 281.  The court concluded 
that the district court's order of dismissal was insufficient, 
however, because the order did not entail a judicially enforced 
obligation to comply with the terms of the agreement:  it 
neither stated that the court retained jurisdiction to enforce 
the parties' agreement nor compelled compliance with the 
terms agreed to by the parties.  Id. at 284.  Rather, the court 
concluded, the findings in the final order were "most properly 
read as noting and reciting the agreement ... as a compo-
nent of its analysis of the mootness of the case...."  Id.  
Similarly, in a case that is closest factually to the instant case, 
the First Circuit in New England Regional Council of Car-
penters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2002), also applying 
s 1988, examined whether the appropriate judicial imprima-
tur on the relief was present.  In Kinton, the answer turned 
on whether the district court had ordered the respondent to 
revise its regulations, the relief that the plaintiff sought in 
court.  Id. at 30.  Proceeding on the assumption that some-
thing other than a final judgment or consent decree sufficed 
for the judicial imprimatur required by Buckhannon, the 
First Circuit concluded upon review of the district court 

transcript that, although the district court had discussed the 
possibility of ordering the defendant to amend its regulations, 
"the [district] court eschewed an order and gave [the defen-
dant] sixty days within which to decide what (if anything) it 
wished to do, reserving the possibility that the court might 
enter an order at a later date."  Id. at 30.  Under the 
circumstances, the First Circuit held that:

     The district court did not compel [the defendant] to 
     adopt the regulations.  Under the Buckhannon rule, that 
     ends the matter.  Because the district court entered no 
     explicit order compelling, or even leading to, [the defen-
     dant's] adoption of the regulations, we cannot say that 
     the district court's refusal to award attorneys' fees con-
     stituted an abuse of discretion.
     
Id. at 30.

     The few district court opinions to have addressed Buckhan-
non likewise take the position that as long as a party has 
obtained some judicial relief more akin to a consent decree 
rather than a private settlement, the Buckhannon test is 
satisfied.  The district court in Aynes v. Space Guard Prod-
ucts, Inc., 201 F.R.D. 445 (S.D. Ind. 2001), concluded that 
although an accepted offer of judgment under Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 68 was "neither a judgment on the merits 
nor a court-ordered consent decree," it satisfied the Buckhan-
non test because it was both "enforceable against [the] De-
fendant by this court unlike the resolution effected by a 
private settlement" and "caused a material alteration of the 
legal relationship of the parties."  Id. at 450-51.  Similarly, in 
Johnny's Icehouse, Inc. v. Amateur Hockey Association of 
Illinois, No. 00-7363, 2001 WL 893840 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 7, 
2001), the court refused to limit unduly the concept of court-
ordered consent decrees and concluded that an order incorpo-
rating a settlement was sufficient under Buckhannon.  Id. at 
*3.  Likewise, in National Coalition for Students with Dis-
abilities v. Bush, 173 F. Supp. 2d 1272 (N.D. Fla. 2001), the 
district court evaluated whether a settlement was the func-
tional equivalent of a consent decree, constituting the neces-

sary judicially-sanctioned change in the legal relationship 
between the parties to satisfy Buckhannon, id. at 1278-79, 
and concluded that it was because it was incorporated by 
reference into a court order in which the court retained 
jurisdiction to enforce its terms.  Id.

     The court today properly begins by addressing whether 
Buckhannon's reasoning applies to attorney's fees suits under 
FOIA, but gives short shrift to Buckhannon's reasoning and 
glosses over whether the relief obtained by OCAW was 
compelled by the district court.  Although the court uses 
language that would suggest that Buckhannon is a bar to 
attorney's fees regardless of the nature of the judicial action 
short of a final judgment or a consent decree, see Opinion at 
8, Buckhannon and the decisions interpreting it make clear 
that there is no principled basis for this suggestion.  What is 
key under Buckhannon is whether the particular relief ob-
tained results in a material change in the legal relationship of 
the parties that bears the necessary judicial imprimatur.  The 
court's failure to come to grips with Buckhannon's holding 
and rationale is only possible because of the second problem 
in the court's opinion.

                               II.

     Buckhannon indicates that to be a "prevailing party" one 
must obtain a change in the legal relationship of the parties 
that bears the necessary judicial imprimatur and cited as 
examples a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered con-
sent decree.  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605;  see also id. at 
622 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Because the question put to this 
court under Buckhannon is whether OCAW obtained a 
change in the legal relationship with the government that 
bears the necessary judicial imprimatur, the court's failure to 
address the district court's orders in the record with any 
particularity is inexplicable.  OCAW, which is the appellee, 
pointed out during oral argument in response to the govern-
ment's argument that the district court did not grant OCAW 
any of its requested relief, that the final resolution "did not 
emerge out of thin air" but resulted because on August 23, 

1999 "the [district] court ordered ... the defendant ... [to] 
cause a search to be made ... and release to plaintiffs all 
records thus retrieved" and thus "the court was intimately 
involved in approving the settlement."  An examination of the 
record makes clear that OCAW in fact obtained judicially 
sanctioned legal relief akin to a consent decree and hence 
sufficient to meet the Buckhannon test.

     Overlooked almost in its entirety is the district court's 
August 23, 1999 Stipulation and Order.  The court's recitation 
of the factual background ignores the August 23 Order.  
When the court finally refers to the August 23 Order it 
misrepresents and confuses its contents and mischaracterizes 
it as a "report."  Opinion at 9.  Contrary to the court's 
assertion, there is no indication in the August 23 Order that 
the government had provided "most of the materials" re-
quested by OCAW.  Opinion at 9.  Although the August 23 
Order resulted in the dismissal of OCAW's requests for some 
records, the order addressed other documents that the gov-
ernment refused to turn over to OCAW despite its FOIA 
request.  In light of the plain terms of the August 23 Order, 
it cannot fairly be described as a "report."  Rather, the 
court's characterization of the August 23 Order as the "par-
ties' second report," Opinion at 9, reveals the court's confu-
sion of this order with the parties' actual second report, dated 
November 8, 1999, which is titled "Second Joint Report."  
The August 23 Order, by contrast, is titled "Stipulation and 
Order" and consists of two parts:  (1) the district court's 
identification of various documents that OCAW sought and 
that the government had refused to release;  and (2) the 
district court's order to the government to search for and 
release those documents (subject to applicable FOIA exemp-
tions) within 60 days.  The district court signed the "Stipula-
tion and Order" stating "Approved And So Ordered."  As the 
parties themselves stated in their second report of November 
8, 1999, "[b]y stipulation and order dated and filed August 23, 
1999, the Court directed defendant to search for certain 
records and to release to plaintiffs 'all records thus retrieved 
except those records or portions of records determined to 
merit continued withholding under applicable law....' " Sec-
ond Joint Report, Nov. 8, 1999 (quoting Stipulation & Order, 
Aug. 23, 1999, at p 2) (emphasis added).  The second report of 

November 8 also indicated that the government had complied 
with the terms of the August 23 Order.

     The existence of the August 23 Order directing the govern-
ment to release documents that OCAW had sought and the 
government had previously withheld is a judicially sanctioned 
victory on the merits;  the release of withheld documents is 
the whole point of a FOIA lawsuit.  See 5 U.S.C. 
s 552(a)(4)(B) (2000);  Students Against Genocide v. Dep't of 
State, 257 F.3d 828, 841 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  The court recog-
nizes as much when it notes that "[h]ad the December 10 
stipulation between [OCAW] and the Energy Department 
outlined documents the government still needed to disclose to 
the union, matters might be different."  Opinion at 10-11.  
But this is precisely what the August 23 Order provided.  As 
a result of the August 23 Order, there is an undeniable 
change in the legal relationship of the parties:  the district 
court ordered the government to release documents that it 
previously refused to produce upon OCAW's request.  In 
addition, the relief obtained by OCAW in the August 23 
Order bore the necessary judicial imprimatur:  unlike a pri-
vate settlement or resolution through negotiations by the 
parties, here, the district court's order recited the terms of 
the parties' negotiations and ultimate agreement so that the 
August 23 Order had elements of both "judicial approval and 
oversight involved in consent decrees."  Buckhannon, 532 
U.S. at 604 n.7.  After the August 23 Order, the government 
was under an enforceable court-ordered legal obligation to 
release the identified documents, potentially facing a con-
tempt citation for failure to comply.  See 5 U.S.C. 
s 552(a)(4)(G).  The August 23 Order is thus a material 
alteration of the legal relationship of the parties bearing the 
necessary judicial imprimatur and hence satisfying Buckhan-
non.  To reach a contrary conclusion the court is forced to 
rely on factual assertions that are unsupported by the record, 
to attack a theory that appears nowhere in this separate 
opinion, and to ignore both the "judicial relief" that OCAW in 
fact obtained and the arguments that OCAW in fact made on 
appeal.

     For these reasons, I conclude that in light of the district 
court's August 23, 1999 Stipulation and Order directing the 

government to release documents previously withheld after 
being requested pursuant to FOIA, OCAW has satisfied the 
Buckhannon test because there has been a judicially sanc-
tioned " 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the 
parties' necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees."  
Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604 (quoting Tex. State Teachers 
Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792-93).  A remand is nonetheless re-
quired, for although the district court ruled that the govern-
ment withheld "numerous categories of documents ... with-
out any legal basis for doing so," the record is unclear 
whether the district court would have reached the same 
decision considering only the documents OCAW obtained 
pursuant to the August 23 Order.  On remand, the district 
court would determine OCAW's entitlement to attorney's 
fees, see Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 
11 F.3d 211, 216 (D.C. Cir. 1993), and if necessary, proportion 
the amount of attorney's fees previously awarded that are 
attributable to OCAW's efforts to obtain the documents that 
the government produced pursuant to the August 23, 1999 
Order.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
