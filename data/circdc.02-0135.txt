     Before:  Ginsburg, Chief Judge, and Rogers and Garland, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge Ginsburg.

     Ginsburg, Chief Judge:  Clifton Power Corporation peti-
tions for review of an order of the Federal Energy Regulato-
ry Commission imposing a civil penalty in the amount of 
$15,000.  Because the petition is incurably premature, we 
dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.

                          I. Background

     Clifton operates a hydroelectric power project on the Paco-
let River in South Carolina.  In 1991 the Commission issued a 
Notice of Proposed Penalty against Clifton for failing to 
install stream-flow monitoring equipment as required by a 
condition of Clifton's license.  See Clifton Power Corp., 54 
F.E.R.C. p 61,339 (Mar. 13, 1991).  An Administrative Law 
Judge determined that the penalty of $148,000 proposed by 
the staff of the Commission -- being $200 for each of 740 
days of noncompliance -- was "grossly excessive" and re-
duced the fine to $15,000.  Clifton Power Corp. 65 F.E.R.C. 
p p 63,007, 65,039 (Oct. 29, 1993).  The Commission rejected 
several of the ALJ's findings and raised the penalty to 
$122,100 -- or $165 for each of the 740 days.  See Clifton 
Power Corp., 69 F.E.R.C. p p 61,087, 61,345-46 (Oct. 26, 
1994).

     On review we upheld the Commission's finding that Clifton 
had violated its license.  See Clifton Power Corp. v. FERC, 88 
F.3d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Clifton I).  We vacated the 
penalty of $122,100, however, because in rejecting the ALJ's 
well-supported assessment of the appropriate sanction the 
Commission had "neither met its responsibility of reasoned 
decisionmaking nor considered the totality of the evidence."  
Id. at 1271.  On remand the Commission adopted the initial 
decision of the ALJ and reinstated the proposed penalty of 
$15,000.  See Clifton Power Corp., 92 F.E.R.C. p p 61,263, 
61,875 (Sep. 28, 2000).  The Commission denied Clifton's 
request for rehearing, 94 F.E.R.C. p 61,332 (Jan. 25, 2001), 
but granted Clifton's request for a stay pending judicial 
review, id. at p 61,338.

     On February 26, 2001 Clifton filed with the Commission a 
second "Request for Rehearing and Reconsideration."  On 
March 20, 2001, with the second request still pending before 
the Commission, Clifton filed the instant petition for judicial 
review.  Eight days later the Commission denied the second 
request for rehearing.  94 F.E.R.C. p 62,275 (Mar. 28, 2001).

                           II. Analysis

     Clifton asserts that the penalty of $15,000 violates the 
mandate in Clifton I, fails to comport with the requirements 
of the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Enforcement Act, 
5 U.S.C. s 601 et seq., is otherwise arbitrary and capricious in 
violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 
s 706(2)(A), and denies it due process of law.  The Commis-
sion responds that Clifton's second request for administrative 
reconsideration, although submitted before Clifton had filed 
its petition for judicial review, rendered the Agency's order 
imposing the penalty non-final, and thereby ousted the court 
of jurisdiction.

     This court is ordinarily without jurisdiction to review an 
agency action that is not final.  See Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 
1081, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  accord, Papago Tribal Util. 
Auth. v. FERC, 628 F.2d 235, 238 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (non-final 
action not subject to review per s 313(b) of Federal Power 
Act).  A request for administrative reconsideration renders 
an agency's otherwise final action non-final with respect to 
the requesting party.  See United Transp. Union v. ICC, 871 
F.2d 1114, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Our cases make clear that a 
petition seeking review of such a non-final action is not only 
premature but incurably so:  "subsequent action by the agen-
cy on a motion for reconsideration does not ripen the petition 
for review or secure appellate jurisdiction."  TeleSTAR, Inc. 
v. FCC, 888 F.2d 132, 134 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Instead, the 
party that had sought administrative reconsideration may, if 
reconsideration is denied, challenge that denial as well as the 
agency's original order by filing a timely petition for review of 
both orders.  The time for filing the petition for review is 
tolled until all proceedings before the agency have been 

completed.  See ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs, 482 U.S. 
270, 284 (1987) ("timely petition for administrative reconsider-
ation stay[s] the running of the Hobbs Act's limitation period 
until the petition had been acted upon by the Commission").

     When the Commission denied Clifton's first request for 
rehearing in January, 2001, the Company had 60 days within 
which to petition for judicial review.  See 16 U.S.C. s 825l(b).  
During that time Clifton had to choose "between rehearing 
before the agency or immediate court review."  Tennessee 
Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 9 F.3d 980, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  
Having chosen in February to return to the Commission, 
Clifton could not seek judicial review until its request for 
administrative reconsideration was resolved by the Commis-
sion on March 28.  See id. at 980 ("It is well-established that 
a party may not simultaneously seek both agency reconsider-
ation and judicial review of an agency's order").  The present 
petition, filed on March 20, before there was a final agency 
action for the court to review, is therefore incurably prema-
ture, and we must dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction.

     But stop:  Clifton contends that the "unique provisions of 
the FPA distinguish this case" from any we have dismissed 
before as incurably premature.  Section 313(a) of the FPA 
provides that the Commission may modify or set aside any 
order, even after a petition for judicial review has been filed, 
"until the record in [the] proceeding shall have been filed in a 
court of appeals," 16 U.S.C. s 825l(a);  and section 313(b) 
declares that "[u]pon the filing of [a] petition [the] court shall 
have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it 
shall be exclusive," id. s 825l(b).  Taken together, these 
provisions contemplate that the Commission and the court 
will have concurrent jurisdiction over a matter from the time 
a party petitions for judicial review until the Agency certifies 
the record to the court, which the Agency must do within 40 
days of the filing of the petition, per Federal Rule of Appel-
late Procedure 17(a).  Clifton argues that because the Com-
mission is therefore free to modify its ruling for a time after a 
petition for review has been filed, no useful purpose is served 
by forcing the petitioner to wait until the Commission has 
resolved its pending administrative requests.

     This argument is based upon an inaccurate understanding 
of both s 313(a) and our cases.*  This court has held already 
that a petition lodged pursuant to 15 U.S.C. s 717r(b) -- a 
provision of the Natural Gas Act identical in all relevant 
respects to s 313 of the FPA -- must be dismissed if filed 
prematurely.  See Tennessee Gas, 9 F.3d at 981;  see also 
City of New Orleans v. SEC, 137 F.3d 638, 639 (D.C. Cir. 
1998) (dismissing petition filed under similar provision of 
s 24(a) of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act, 15 
U.S.C. s 79x(a)).  Nor is s 313 "unique" (or even unusual) in 
authorizing an agency to revise its decision, even after a 
petition for review has been filed, until such time as the 
agency has filed its record with the reviewing court.  See Act 
of August 8, 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-791, 72 Stat. 941 s 16 
(1958) (amending s 313 and judicial review provisions of 37 
other statutes to allow agencies to exercise concurrent juris-
diction).  It is the petitioner's request for administrative 
rehearing, not the agency's authority to reconsider a decision, 
that renders the agency's decision non-final as to the petition-
er and renders the previously-filed petition for judicial review 
incurably premature.  See Wade v. FCC, 986 F.2d 1433, 1434 
(D.C. Cir. 1993) ("Wade's request for agency reconsideration 
rendered the underlying action nonfinal, regardless of the 
order of filing").

     There is good reason to prohibit any litigant from pressing 
its cause concurrently upon both the judicial and the adminis-
trative fronts:  a favorable decision from the agency might yet 
obviate the need for review by the court.  See New Orleans, 
137 F.3d at 639.  Clifton would have the court receive its 
petition, place the case on the docket, process the initial 
submissions of all the parties, and entertain various prelimi-
nary motions while at the same time the petitioner under-

__________
     * On the eve of oral argument, counsel for the Commission 
advised the court that because Clifton seeks review of a penalty 
assessment, s 31 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. s 823b(d)(2)(B), "may 
govern the procedures for petitioning for review instead of the 
review provisions of section 313."  We need not pass upon the 
question, however, as we are without jurisdiction under either 
provision.

takes before the Commission to get further relief that would 
make the case moot and our efforts supererogatory.  See 
TeleSTAR, 888 F.2d at 134 ("it is a pointless waste of judicial 
energy for the court to process any petition for review before 
the agency has acted on the request for reconsideration").  
Those efforts may be multiplied many fold if the petitioner 
moves the court for a stay of the agency's order pending 
appeal -- which requires a panel of the court to conduct 
within a few days a searching inquiry encompassing, among 
other things, whether the petitioner is likely to prevail on the 
merits of its case, see Ayuda, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d 
153, 153 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The costs of exercising the judicial 
power are simply too high to allow a litigant lightly to start 
down, only opportunistically to abandon, the path of judicial 
review, cf. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984) ("federal 
courts may exercise power only in the last resort and as a 
necessity");  and the same "danger of wasted judicial effort 
that attends the simultaneous exercise of judicial and agency 
jurisdiction ... arises whether a party seeks agency reconsid-
eration before, simultaneous with, or after filing an appeal or 
petition for judicial review," Wade, 986 F.2d at 1434.

     The Company raises four other arguments, each of which 
we may reject in short order.  First, Clifton contends that 
the requirement of finality is merely a prudential consider-
ation, with which we may dispense, rather than a jurisdiction-
al prerequisite.  Our cases flatly foreclose this argument, see 
New Orleans, 137 F.3d at 639 (petition filed prematurely "will 
be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction"), and it is of no help to 
Clifton that the court once purported to waive this require-
ment, see TeleSTAR, Inc. v. FCC, 888 F.2d 132, 134 (D.C. Cir. 
1989), because there now is no doubt that the questions of 
jurisdiction cannot be pretermitted, see Steel Co. v. Citizens 
for a Better Env., 523 U.S. 83, 94-95 (1998).

     Second, Clifton claims that the Commission's denial of its 
second request for reconsideration "can be deemed as having 
ripened Clifton's petition for review for jurisdictional pur-
poses."  Our precedent, however, makes clear that prematuri-
ty is an incurable defect:  "even if the agency acts on the 
administrative reconsideration motion before argument is 

heard on the judicial review petition," we must dismiss for 
want of jurisdiction.  New Orleans, 137 F.3d at 639.

     Third, Clifton refers the court to certain arguments that it 
presented in preliminary filings before this court, which argu-
ments Clifton omitted from its briefs "due to page con-
straints."  We will not countenance Clifton's attempt to cir-
cumvent the page limits, however, see Fed. R. App. P. 
32(a)(B)(i), and we accordingly will not address any argu-
ments that Clifton has not presented in its briefs, see Fed. R. 
App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (requiring petitioner's brief to contain the 
litigant's "contentions and the reasons for them").

     Lastly, the Company contends that it "need not comply 
with the jurisdictional prerequisites of seeking rehearing 
under Section 313" because "this proceeding, although styled 
as a petition for review, calls upon the court to invoke its 
inherent powers of mandamus and enforcement to ensure 
that the Commission has complied with its order" in Clifton I. 
True it is that a "federal appellate court has the authority, 
through the process of mandamus, to correct any misconcep-
tion of its mandate by a lower court or administrative agency 
subject to its authority."  Office of Consumers' Counsel v. 
FERC, 826 F.2d 1136, 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Clifton falls far 
short of making out its entitlement to a writ of mandamus, 
however;  the "remedy of mandamus is reserved for extraor-
dinary circumstances in which the petitioner demonstrates 
that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputa-
ble," Byrd v. Reno, 180 F.3d 298, 302 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

     Our decision in Clifton I instructed the Commission that it 
may neither punish Clifton because other power projects 
owned by the same licensee had violated the FPA, see Clifton, 
88 F.3d at 1267, nor "refus[e] to consider record evidence 
regarding Clifton's inability to pay," id. at 1267;  and must 
calculate any penalty according to the statutory factors set 
out in 16 U.S.C. s 823b(c), see id. at 1271.  The Commission's 
decision to adopt the opinion of the ALJ, thereby reducing 
the proposed penalty to $15,000 from $122,000, presumably 
reflects the Commission's effort to follow those instructions.  
In any event, Clifton falls far short of showing that "the writ 

is necessary to emend a clear error or abuse of discretion."  
Philip Morris Inc. v. Venezuela, 287 F.3d 192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 
2002).

                         III. Conclusion

     Having determined that we are without jurisdiction to 
consider Clifton's petition, and that Clifton is not entitled to a 
writ of mandamus to enforce our mandate in Clifton I, we do 
not address Clifton's arguments on the merits.  For the 
foregoing reasons, the petition for review is

                                                                 Dismissed.
