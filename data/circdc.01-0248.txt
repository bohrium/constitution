Senior Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Petitioner RAG Cumberland Re-
sources LP, the owner and operator of a coal mine, challenges 
an order issued against it pursuant to s 104(d)(2) of the 
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act"), 
30 U.S.C. s 814(d)(2).  The Secretary of Labor issued the 
order after a federal mine inspector discovered that, for the 
second time in four months, the petitioner had violated a 
mandatory mine safety standard through conduct constituting 
more than ordinary negligence.  RAG Cumberland does not 
deny that it committed those violations, but asserts that the 
Mine Act bars the Secretary from issuing the order because 
its mine passed a "clean inspection" during the period be-
tween the two violations.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) 
for the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission 
(FMSHRC or the "Commission") agreed with the petitioner 
and vacated the order.  On discretionary review, the Commis-
sion set aside the ALJ's conclusion and reinstated the order.  
For the reasons set forth below, we deny RAG Cumberland's 
petition for review of the Commission's decision.

                                I

     The Mine Act requires the Secretary of Labor to promul-
gate mandatory health and safety standards for the nation's 
mines.  Mine Act s 101(a), 30 U.S.C. s 811(a).  To ensure 
compliance with those standards, the Act requires representa-
tives of the Secretary to inspect each underground mine "in 
its entirety" at least four times per year and to develop

the time of oral argument.

guidelines for conducting additional inspections as appropri-
ate.  Mine Act s 103(a), 30 U.S.C. s 813(a).  The Mine 
Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) conducts these 
inspections on behalf of the Secretary.

     Section 104 of the Mine Act, 30 U.S.C. s 814, directs the 
Secretary to issue citations and orders to mine operators who 
are not in compliance with the Act or the regulations promul-
gated thereunder.  A MSHA inspector who discovers a viola-
tion of a mandatory health or safety standard must issue a 
s 104(a) citation to the operator.  The citation must describe 
the violation with particularity and fix a reasonable time for 
its abatement.  30 U.S.C. s 814(a).

     Section 104(d) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. s 814(d), the principal 
section at issue here, creates a "chain" of increasingly severe 
sanctions for certain violations of mandatory standards.  Nac-
co Mining Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 9 F.M.S.H.R.C. 1541, 1545-
46 (1987).  If an inspector finds a violation of a mandatory 
standard that could "significantly and substantially" contrib-
ute to a mine safety or health hazard, and that was caused by 
an "unwarrantable failure" of the operator to comply with the 
standard,1 MSHA issues what is commonly referred to as a 
s 104(d)(1) citation.  30 U.S.C. s 814(d)(1);  see Sec'y of 
Labor v. Cyprus Cumberland Res. Corp., 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. 
722, 725 (1999) ("Commission Decision I").  If, during the 
same inspection or any subsequent inspection within the next 
ninety days, an inspector discovers another violation of a 
mandatory standard caused by an unwarrantable failure to 
comply, MSHA issues a s 104(d)(1) withdrawal order--also 
known as a "predicate order."  See Sec'y of Labor v. Wyo-
ming Fuel Co., 16 F.M.S.H.R.C. 1618, 1622 n.7 (1994).2  A 
withdrawal order requires the mine operator to remove all

     1  An unwarrantable failure occurs when the violation is caused 
by "aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negli-
gence."  Emery Mining Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor, 9 F.M.S.H.R.C. 
1997, 2004 (1987).

     2 "Unlike section 104(d)(1) citations, section 104(d)(1) withdrawal 
orders require no 'significantly and substantially' findings."  Sec'y

persons (except those needed to correct the problem) from 
the area until the violation has been corrected.  30 U.S.C. 
s 814(d)(1).  When such an order is issued, production in the 
affected area of the mine must cease.

     Once a s 104(d)(1) withdrawal order has been issued, if 
"upon any subsequent inspection" an inspector finds a viola-
tion caused by an unwarrantable failure, the inspector issues 
a s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order.3  The chain of sanctions 
continues, with each new unwarrantable violation generating 
a s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order "until such time as an inspec-
tion of such mine discloses no similar violations."  30 U.S.C. 
s 814(d)(2) (emphasis added);  see United Mine Workers v. 
FMSHRC, 768 F.2d 1477, 1478-79 (D.C. Cir. 1985);  Nacco

     3  Unlike a s 104(d)(1) withdrawal order, which may only be 
issued within ninety days of its predicate s 104(d)(1) citation, a 
s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order may be issued within any period after 
its predicate s 104(d)(1) withdrawal order.

     4  Section 104(d)(2) states:

          If a withdrawal order with respect to any area in a ... mine 
     has been issued pursuant to [s 104(d)(1)], a withdrawal order 
     shall promptly be issued by an [inspector] who finds upon any 
     subsequent inspection the existence in such mine of violations 
     similar to those that resulted in the issuance of the withdrawal 
     order under [s 104(d)(1)] until such time as an inspection of 
     such mine discloses no similar violations.  Following an inspec-
     tion of such mine which discloses no similar violations, the 
     provisions of [s 104(d)(1)] shall again be applicable to that 
     mine.
     
30 U.S.C. s 814(d)(2).  As used in s 104(d)(2), the term "similar 
violations" means other violations caused by unwarrantable failures;  
they need not be substantively similar to the violation upon which 
the original order was based.  See S. Rep. No. 95-181, at 32 (1977);  
Greenwich Collieries v. Sec'y of Labor, 12 F.M.S.H.R.C. 940, 945 
(1990);  see also Int'l Union, United Mine Workers v. Kleppe, 532 
F.2d 1403, 1406-07 (D.C. Cir. 1976).  In addition, a s 104(d)(2) 
withdrawal order, like a s 104(d)(1) withdrawal order, "may issue 
on the basis of 'unwarrantable failure' findings alone," without a 

such mine" necessary to end the sanctions chain is known as a 
"clean inspection."  See Sec'y of Labor v. Kitt Energy Corp., 6 
F.M.S.H.R.C. 1596, 1596 (1984).  To sustain a s 104(d)(2) 
withdrawal order, the Secretary has the burden of proving, 
by a preponderance of the evidence, that a clean inspection 
has not occurred since the issuance of the previous withdraw-
al order.  Id. at 1600.

                                II

     RAG Cumberland owns and operates the Cumberland 
Mine, an underground bituminous coal mine near Waynes-
burg, Pennsylvania.5  Each year, MSHA conducts four regu-
lar health and safety inspections of the entire Cumberland 
Mine.  The inspections are conducted quarterly by two 
MSHA inspectors who are assigned to the mine on a full-time 
basis.  An inspection usually takes a full quarter to complete.  
Other inspectors from MSHA's Waynesburg field office peri-
odically visit the mine to assist the two full-time inspectors.  
See Commission Decision I, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 723.

     On June 18, 1997, during a regular quarterly inspection, a 
MSHA inspector issued the Cumberland Mine a s 104(d)(1) 
withdrawal order for a significant and substantial and unwar-
rantable violation of a mandatory safety standard.  Id.  On 
September 24, 1997, during the next quarterly inspection, the 
mine was issued a s 104(a) citation for a violation of MSHA's 
mandatory roof control standard.  In response, the mine 
installed a hydraulic jack to support the roof, which tempo-
rarily abated the violation, and placed two warning signs in 
the area.  The next day, however, the inspector discovered 
that the jack and signs had been removed and that miners

finding that the violation was significant and substantial.  Sec'y of 
Labor v. FMSHRC, 111 F.3d at 919.

     5  At the time of the events in question, the mine was operated 
by Cyprus Cumberland Resources Corporation.  RAG Cumberland 
is the new parent company of Cyprus and is the petitioner here.  
For purposes of clarity, in this opinion we will refer to RAG 
Cumberland as the entity against which the Secretary's enforce-
ment action was taken.

had been working beneath the unsupported roof.  This, he 
determined, constituted a significant and substantial and un-
warrantable violation of the roof control standard.  In light of 
the predicate June 18 order, MSHA issued RAG Cumberland 
a s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order on September 25.  Id. at 724.

     RAG Cumberland filed a challenge to the September 25 
order with FMSHRC.  The company stipulated to the validi-
ty of the June 18 predicate order, and further stipulated both 
that it had violated the roof control standard on September 25 
and that the violation was significant and substantial and had 
been caused by an unwarrantable failure.  The sole basis for 
RAG Cumberland's challenge was its contention that a 
s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order was unjustified because MSHA 
had conducted a clean inspection of the Cumberland Mine 
during the period between June 18 and September 25.  The 
Secretary, in turn, stipulated that MSHA had, in fact, thor-
oughly inspected all areas of the mine between those dates--
with the exception of the 60 West Mains haulage, a 4200-foot 
passage that serves as the primary route into and out of the 
mine.  Thus, the only question affecting the validity of the 
September 25 order was whether MSHA had conducted a 
clean inspection of the 60 West Mains haulage itself between 
June 18 and September 25.  Id.

     RAG Cumberland's challenge to MSHA's September 25 
withdrawal order made two complete trips through the 
FMSHRC adjudicatory process before arriving at this court.  
The challenge was initially heard before an ALJ, who con-
cluded that MSHA had conducted an intervening clean in-
spection of the haulage and therefore downgraded the 
s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order to a s 104(d)(1) citation.  Cy-
prus Cumberland Res. Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor, 20 
F.M.S.H.R.C. 285, 295 (1998) ("ALJ Decision I").  The ALJ 
based his conclusion on the Secretary's stipulation that, dur-
ing the relevant period, MSHA inspectors traveled through 
the 60 West Mains haulage "many times," in both open and 
closed vehicles, en route to conduct inspections in other areas 
of the mine.  Id. at 294.  The ALJ disagreed with the 
Secretary's view that such travel was insufficient to constitute 
a clean "inspection of such mine" within the meaning of 

s 104(d)(2).  The ALJ did not dispute the reasonableness of 
the Secretary's statutory interpretation:  that to constitute an 
"inspection," inspectors must leave their vehicles and conduct 
a detailed examination for non-obvious hazards.  Id. at 289.  
Rather, he simply "decline[d] to defer to the Secretary's 
interpretation," id., holding instead that the inspectors' "op-
portunity to observe" the mine's conditions was enough to 
represent a clean inspection under the Act, id. at 294.

     On discretionary review, the Commission vacated the ALJ's 
decision.  It concluded that the ALJ had erred in relying on 
the inspectors' repeated travel through the haulage, rather 
than examining evidence of actual inspection activity.  Com-
mission Decision I, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 727.  The Commis-
sion explained that under controlling precedent, the physical 
presence of an inspector in each area of the mine is insuffi-
cient to constitute a clean inspection.  To the contrary, such 
an inspection requires inspectors to conduct a "thorough and 
complete" examination for all potential hazards, not only 
those that are visible or obvious.  Id. at 726.  Since RAG 
Cumberland's own safety manager had conceded "that an 
inspector would have to stop and exit the vehicle in order to 
inspect a number of conditions," id. at 727 n.6 (citing ALJ 
Hr'g Tr. at 772, 818, 827-29, 844-48),6 the Commission reject-
ed the ALJ's premise that the inspectors' vehicular travel 
constituted a clean inspection of the 60 West Mains haulage.  
It therefore remanded the case to the ALJ to determine 
whether the Secretary had met her burden of establishing the 
absence of a clean inspection, "by examining evidence regard-
ing any inspection activity in the haulage area during the time 
period in question."  Id. at 728.  The Commission specifically 
instructed the ALJ to examine a log, maintained by the mine 
operator, that depicted all inspection activity in the mine.  Id.

     On remand, the ALJ again converted the s 104(d)(2) with-
drawal order to a s 104(d)(1) citation.  Cyprus Cumberland 
Res. Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. 1112, 1118 

__________
     6  Those included "electrical installations, fire fighting equip-
ment, roof and rib conditions, ventilation, and the condition of the 
track."  Id.

(1999) ("ALJ Decision II").  The ALJ noted that, during 
their many trips through the haulage, the inspectors had "an 
opportunity, if not an obligation, to repeatedly observe the 
roof, rib and track conditions," and that they "could have left 
their battery operated vehicles at any time if they had 
observed any hazardous or violative condition."  Id. at 1113.  
"The Secretary cannot prevail," the ALJ said, "simply by 
establishing that inspectors had not exited their battery 
operated vehicles to inspect electrical boxes located in the 60 
Mains."  Id. at 1115.  Rather, the ALJ held, the decisive 
question was whether a "reasonable person ... would con-
clude" that the inspectors' observations during their trips 
through the haulage "constitute[d] an adequate inspection for 
hazardous conditions."  Id. at 1116.  Applying this "reason-
able person test," the ALJ held that it would be "unreason-
able to conclude" that the inspectors had not conducted a 
clean inspection.  Id.

     Once again, the Commission reversed.  Sec'y of Labor v. 
RAG Cumberland Res. Corp., 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. 1066 (2000) 
("Commission Decision II").  The Commission held that an 
actual, "thorough and complete" inspection--not the mere 
opportunity to observe visible hazards--is required to sever 
the chain of sanctions.  Id. at 1072.  Applying that standard 
to the facts of record, the Commission reinstated the Secre-
tary's s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order.  Id.

                               III

     The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission 
adjudicates disputes arising under the Mine Act, including 
challenges by mine operators to citations and orders issued 
by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to s 104.  See Mine Act 
s 113, 30 U.S.C. s 823.  Under the statutory scheme, the 
Commission is required to accord deference to " 'the Secre-
tary's interpretations of the law and regulations.' "  Sec'y of 
Labor v. Cannelton Indus., Inc., 867 F.2d 1432, 1435 (D.C. 
Cir. 1989) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-181, at 49 (1977)).  And 
while it may reverse a decision by an ALJ for legal error, the 
Commission must uphold an ALJ's factual determinations if 

they are supported by substantial evidence.  See Donovan ex 
rel. Chacon v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 709 F.2d 86, 90-91 (D.C. 
Cir. 1983) (interpreting 30 U.S.C. s 823(d)(2)).7

     Any person adversely affected by a Commission order may 
petition to this court for review.  Mine Act s 106(a), 30 
U.S.C. s 816(a).  Like the Commission, we are required to 
accord deference to the Secretary's reasonable interpreta-
tions of the language of the Mine Act.  See Cannelton, 867 
F.2d at 1435 (citing Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. 
Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)).8  When the Secretary and 
the Commission divide, we must defer to the Secretary.  See 
id.;  see also Sec'y of Labor v. FMSHRC, 111 F.3d 913, 920 
(D.C. Cir. 1997);  cf. Martin v. Occupational Safety & Health 
Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 152-53 (1991) (holding that, 
under a similar split-enforcement scheme, court must defer to 
the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor rather than to 
that of OSHRC).9  Where, as here, the Secretary and the 
Commission agree, there is no question but that we must 
accord deference to their joint view.  See Energy West Min-
ing Co. v. FMSHRC, 111 F.3d 900, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1997);  
Emerald Mines Co. v. FMSHRC, 863 F.2d 51, 54 (D.C. Cir. 
1988).  Finally, we are required to uphold the Commission's

     7  In this regard, administrative review under the Mine Act is 
unlike that under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
s 557(b), which ordinarily "empowers agencies to make independent 
factual findings on the basis of a record developed by an ALJ."  
Donovan, 709 F.2d at 91.

     8  Of course, "the Secretary, the Commission, and this court ... 
'must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Con-
gress.' "  Cannelton, 867 F.2d at 1435 (citing Chevron, 467 U.S. at 
843).  But the Mine Act is silent with respect to what constitutes 
the "inspection" required to break the chain of s 104(d)(2) sanc-
tions.

     9  Cf. also Martin, 499 U.S. at 157 (holding that "the Secretary's 
litigating position before [OSHRC] is as much an exercise of 
delegated lawmaking powers as is the Secretary's promulgation of a 
workplace health and safety standard," and that "the Secretary's 
interpretation is not undeserving of deference merely because the 
Secretary advances it for the first time in an administrative adjudi-
cation").

factual findings "if supported by substantial evidence on the 
record considered as a whole."  Mine Act s 106(a)(1), 30 
U.S.C. s 816(a)(1).10

     RAG Cumberland contends that, in reversing the ALJ's 
conclusion regarding the occurrence of a clean inspection, the 
Commission exceeded its statutorily prescribed standard of 
review.  The Commission did this, petitioner asserts, by 
reweighing the evidence before the ALJ rather than uphold-
ing factual determinations that were supported by substantial 
evidence.  See Donovan, 709 F.2d at 92 (holding that, under 
the Mine Act, the Commission may not "substitute a compet-
ing view of the facts for the view the ALJ reasonably 
reached").  We disagree.  The Commission did not reverse 
the ALJ because it weighed the record evidence differently 
than he did.  Instead, the Commission reversed because the 
ALJ applied a legally erroneous interpretation of the clean 
inspection standard to the record facts, and because it was 
clear that under the correct standard those facts established 
the absence of a clean inspection.  We uphold the Commis-
sion's decision on both counts.

__________
     10  As discussed above, although it may reverse an ALJ's deci-
sion for legal error, the Commission must uphold an ALJ's factual 
determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence.  Don-
ovan, 709 F.2d at 90.  Because in this case we conclude that the 
Commission properly vacated the ALJ's decision for legal error, we 
need not consider the precise standard of review we would apply to 
a Commission decision reversing an ALJ's findings of fact.  Cf. 
Burns v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 41 
F.3d 1555, 1562 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that, on a petition for 
review of a decision by the Benefits Review Board under the split-
enforcement scheme of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Com-
pensation Act, rather than defer to the Board the court must 
"conduct an independent review of the record to determine if the 
ALJ's findings are supported by substantial evidence") (internal 
quotation marks omitted);  id. at 1565 (Silberman, J., concurring) 
(observing the anomaly of a court independently reviewing the 
record, but noting uncertainty as to whether "any different scope of 
review[ ] is even theoretically available to a court of appeals under 
this statute").

                                A

     In its review of the ALJ's initial decision, the Commission 
determined that he misapplied the law by holding that the 
inspectors' repeated travel through the 60 West Mains haul-
age was sufficient to establish a clean inspection.  The Com-
mission remanded, instructing the ALJ to consider the record 
evidence regarding actual inspection activity in the haulage, 
including RAG Cumberland's inspection log, in order to deter-
mine whether the Secretary had met her burden of proving 
that a thorough and complete inspection had not occurred.  
Commission Decision I, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 727-28.  In 
reviewing the ALJ's decision on remand, the Commission 
determined that he failed to comply with its instructions to 
consider "the record evidence regarding inspections in the 
haulage."  Commission Decision II, 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1071.  
"Rather," the Commission said, "the judge applied the 'rea-
sonable person test' " to determine whether a clean inspection 
had occurred.  Id.

     The ALJ described the "reasonable person test" he thought 
applicable to this case as follows:

     The question is whether a reasonable person, familiar 
     with the deterrent purposes of section 104(d)(2) with 
     respect to unwarrantable failure, would conclude that the 
     numerous mine inspectors' observations (during approxi-
     mately 135 round trips) of the 60 West Mains haulage 
     ribs, roof, and track, constitute an adequate inspec-
     tion....
     
ALJ Decision II, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1116.  The Commission 
rightly rejected that test as legally erroneous.  Congress did 
not delegate the authority to determine the meaning of a 
statutory term like "inspection" to a theoretical reasonable 
person.  To the contrary, as we noted above, Congress in-
tended the Secretary of Labor to interpret the terms of the 
Mine Act.  See Cannelton, 867 F.2d at 1435 (citing S. Rep. No. 
95-181, at 49).  And ALJs, the Commission, and this court are 
all bound to defer to the Secretary's interpretations--provid-
ed, of course, that they are reasonable.  Id.

     The Commission also rejected the definition of a clean 
inspection that the ALJ apparently thought a reasonable 
person would adopt.  The ALJ noted that the "inspectors 
could have left their vehicles at any time if they had observed 
any conditions that caused concern," suggesting that the 
opportunity to examine visible hazards was sufficient even if 
there was no evidence that the inspectors had done so.  ALJ 
Decision II, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1113 (emphasis added).  
Moreover, the ALJ held that the Secretary "cannot prevail 
simply by establishing that inspectors had not exited their 
battery operated vehicles to inspect electrical boxes located in 
the 60 Mains," suggesting that the inspection of non-visible 
hazards (e.g., ones that could only be determined by opening 
electrical boxes) was not required.  Id. at 1115 (emphasis 
added).

     The Commission rejected these views, agreeing with the 
Secretary that a clean inspection requires a "thorough and 
complete" inspection for violations of any kind, "obvious or 
otherwise."  See Commission Decision II, 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. 
at 1072;  id. at 1069 (stating the Secretary's position);  see 
also Commission Decision I, 21 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 726 (citing 
Eastern Associated Coal Corp., 3 I.B.M.A. 331, 357-58, 81 
Interior Dec. 567, 579-80 (Bd. Mine Op. App. 1974) (holding 
that, under the same language in the predecessor to the Mine 
Act, a clean inspection required a "thorough examination of 
conditions and practices throughout a mine")).  The Commis-
sion also agreed with the Secretary that the opportunity to 
conduct such an inspection is not alone sufficient.  And the 
Commission further emphasized that "mere travel through an 
area of the mine, without evidence of a thorough and com-
plete inspection, does not suffice to support a finding that a 
clean inspection occurred."  Commission Decision II, 22 
F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1073.  Accordingly, the Commission held, 
evidence of actual "inspection activity in the haulage area 
during the relevant time period must be considered" in order 
to decide the instant case.  Id.

     The Commission's ruling constitutes a reasonable interpre-
tation of the statutory phrase "inspection of such mine" in 
s 104(d)(2), and hence one to which we must defer.  Indeed, 

we would be hard pressed to decide otherwise, since the 
Commission expressly rested its interpretation on a prior 
decision of this court.  See id. at 1072-74 (citing United Mine 
Workers v. FMSHRC, 768 F.2d 1477 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  As 
the Commission accurately observed, in United Mine Work-
ers we rejected the notion that "an inspector's physical pres-
ence in each area of the mine--regardless of the object of the 
inspection or the hazards actually examined for in each 
particular area--qualifies as an intervening 'clean' inspec-
tion."  768 F.2d at 1479.  "The only rational reading of the 
intervening 'clean' inspection requirement," we held, "is that 
all areas of a mine must be inspected for all hazards," both 
the "unseen" and the "visible."  Id. at 1480.  In fact, contrary 
to the very example used by the ALJ here, we suggested that 
in order to conduct a clean inspection, an inspector must 
"open an electrical junction box to see whether the wiring 
inside is safe."  Id. at 1479-80.11

     Notwithstanding the previously expressed views of both the 
Secretary and this court, RAG Cumberland challenges the 
validity of the Commission's conclusion that a clean inspection 
requires an examination for non-obvious hazards, arguing 
that there is evidence that MSHA inspectors do not always 
inspect as thoroughly as this view of the statute requires.  
Lax inspection practices in the field, however, cannot trump 
the views of the Secretary of Labor and the Commission.  Cf. 
Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 
1998) (explaining that "deference is owed to the decisionmak-
er authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, not to each 
individual agency employee").  We therefore hold that the 
Commission properly vacated the ALJ's decision as based on 
a legally erroneous definition of the requirements of a clean 
inspection under s 104(d)(2) of the Mine Act.

                                B

     Having vacated the ALJ's erroneous view of the law, the 
Commission examined the record evidence regarding actual

     11  As another example, we observed that to "determine whether 
there are unsafe concentrations of gases or dust an inspector must 
employ special monitoring equipment."  Id. at 1479.

inspection activity in the 60 West Mains haulage, and, based 
on that evidence, reinstated the Secretary's s 104(d)(2) with-
drawal order.  Commission Decision II, 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 
1073-75.  Although the Commission may not "substitute a 
competing view of the facts for the view the ALJ reasonably 
reached," Donovan, 709 F.2d at 92, it may apply the law to 
the facts in the record and "modify the decision or order of 
the administrative law judge in conformity with the record."  
Mine Act s 113(d)(2)(C), 30 U.S.C. s 823(d)(2)(C).12  If sup-
ported by substantial evidence, the Commission's findings are 
conclusive upon this court.  Mine Act s 106(a)(1), 30 U.S.C. 
s 816(a)(1).

     In deciding that there had not been an intervening clean 
inspection at the Cumberland Mine, the Commission relied on 
two categories of evidence:  the testimony of two of the full-
time MSHA inspectors responsible for quarterly inspections 
of the mine and a log tracking actual inspection activity at the 
mine.  The two inspectors testified that they did not conduct 
an inspection of the haulage between June 18 and September 
25, 1997.  ALJ Hr'g Tr. 287-88, 476, 501.  As one of the 
inspectors put it, "I didn't stop and I didn't do the things 
necessary to inspect the haulage.  I just traveled across it."  
Id. at 288 (quoted in Commission Decision II, 22 
F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1074).  RAG Cumberland maintains that this 
testimony is inconclusive because it fails to prove that no 
inspector conducted a clean inspection.  But the Commission 
properly rejected the contention that, to meet her burden of 
proof, the Secretary must submit evidence from every inspec-
tor who traveled through the haulage.  Commission Decision 
II, 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1070.  As the Commission pointed out, 

__________
     12  Under s 113(d)(2)(C) of the Mine Act, the Commission must 
remand the case to the ALJ only if it "determines that further 
evidence is necessary on an issue of fact."  30 U.S.C. s 823(d)(2)(C);  
see Walker Stone Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 156 F.3d 1076, 1085 n.6 
(10th Cir. 1998) (holding remand unnecessary where the "essential 
facts were not in dispute");  Sellersburg Stone Co. v. FMSHRC, 736 
F.2d 1147, 1153 (7th Cir. 1984) (holding remand not required 
"[g]iven the Commission's conclusion that uncontroverted evidence 
did not warrant further factual findings").

when it originally placed the burden of proving the absence of 
a clean inspection on the Secretary, it also made clear that to 
carry this burden the Secretary "need not prove a negative."  
Id. (citing Kitt Energy Corp., 6 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1600).

     The Commission's precedent also provides that, to show the 
absence of a clean inspection, the Secretary may rely upon 
inspection records for the period in question.  See Kitt Ener-
gy Corp., 6 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1600. Here, the mine operator 
kept a log, which the Commission found and the record 
confirms documents all inspection activity in the mine during 
the relevant period.  See Commission Decision I, 21 
F.M.S.H.R.C. at 728.  "Of special significance," the Commis-
sion said, was "the [ALJ's] finding, which is undisputed on 
review, that the log entries do not indicate that any regular or 
spot inspections took place in the 60 West Mains" haulage 
between June 18 and September 25.  Commission Decision 
II, 22 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1073 (citing ALJ Decision II, 21 
F.M.S.H.R.C. at 1114).  We agree that the absence of a log 
reference to any inspections in the haulage is strong evidence 
that the area was not inspected.

     Contrary to RAG Cumberland's contention, the fact that 
the mine operator rather than the Secretary initially intro-
duced the log into evidence does not mean that it cannot be 
used to support a finding in favor of the Secretary.  See 
Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mountain Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 
1185, 1187 (10th Cir. 1970).  Nor does it make the log any 
less probative.  If anything, the fact that the mine operator 
itself maintained the log makes it even more probative, 
because the operator had every incentive to list particular 
areas as having been inspected in order to break the chain of 
s 104(d)(2) sanctions.13

__________
     13  RAG Cumberland also contends that the log does not docu-
ment areas that were inspected, but instead merely indicates an 
inspector's ultimate destination on a particular day.  The ALJ did 
not make such a finding, and the company's characterization is 
contradicted by the record.  In addition to testimony by a Cumber-
land employee that the log tracks the areas of the mine that were 

     In sum, RAG Cumberland's log of inspection activity, to-
gether with the testimony of the MSHA inspectors, provides 
substantial evidence for the Commission's conclusion that a 
clean inspection of the 60 West Mains haulage did not occur 
prior to the issuance of the September 25 withdrawal order.

                                IV

     Because the Commission adopted an appropriate standard 
for determining whether there was a clean inspection of the 
60 West Mains haulage, and because substantial evidence in 
the record supports the Commission's decision to reinstate 
the Secretary's s 104(d)(2) withdrawal order under that stan-
dard, the petition for review is
