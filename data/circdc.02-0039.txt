     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Michael D. 
Thompson was convicted on one count of unlawful distribution 
of fifty grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. 
s 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(a)(3).  He appeals, contending that the 
district court erroneously excluded evidence and erroneously 
charged the jury;  he also challenges the sufficiency of the 
evidence to support his conviction.  We affirm the district 
court's rulings and uphold his conviction.

                                I.

     On October 22, 1997 Detective David Dessin of the Metro-
politan Police Department (MPD) and a confidential infor-
mant (Robert) approached Mitchell Douglas (Douglas) to buy 
cocaine base.  Gov't App. Tab B, at 6-7.  Dessin was working 
as an undercover agent for the High Intensity Drug-Traffick-
ing Area Task Force, a joint task force of the MPD and the 
United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  
8/29/00 Tr. 5-6.  Douglas agreed to sell but told Dessin that 
he would complete the transaction--$1500 for 62 grams of 
cocaine base--the next day at 5:00 p.m. in a nearby Popeye's 
Chicken parking lot.  Id.

     On October 23, 1997 Dessin waited in an unmarked police 
car, a Lexus, in the restaurant parking lot.  Shortly after 
Dessin arrived, Robert drove into the parking lot and parked 
next to Dessin.  Dessin did not expect to see him because 
Robert had earlier told him that he could not participate in 
the bust.  8/29/00 Tr. 14.  Dessin told him to get into the 
Lexus so that the targets would not become suspicious of his 
separate arrival.  Id. at 15.

     At approximately 5:10 p.m., an unknown person later iden-
tified as appellant Thompson approached Dessin and asked, 
"Are you Rob's boy?"  8/29/00 Tr. 16.  Dessin responded, 
"Yeah."  Id.  Thompson then stated, "Mitch told me to give 
you this."  Id.  Dessin told Thompson to get into the car.  

Thompson opened the driver's side rear door and sat behind 
Dessin.  Dessin asked him, "Do you have that joint?"  Id. at 
18.  Thompson responded by handing him a large Burger 
King cup with a lid on it.  The cup was later shown to have 
contained cocaine base.  Dessin then gave Thompson a bun-
dle of money in exchange.  Thompson asked, "What's this?"  
Dessin responded, "15" (meaning $1500).  Id. at 25.  Thomp-
son asked, "Are you straight?", to which Dessin replied, "I'm 
straight."  Id.  Thompson got out of the car and walked out 
of the parking lot.

     Thompson and Douglas were subsequently indicted on vari-
ous drug charges.  Douglas was charged in all four counts of 
the indictment, which included two separate acts of distribu-
tion and two telephone facilitation counts.  Thompson was 
named in count four only, which charged both Thompson and 
Douglas with unlawful distribution of more than 50 grams of 
cocaine base on or about October 23, 1997.  Douglas pleaded 
guilty and was ultimately sentenced to 70 months' imprison-
ment.

     Thompson proceeded to trial as the sole defendant on count 
four of the indictment.  Following a three-day jury trial, 
Thompson was found guilty of unlawful distribution of fifty 
grams or more of cocaine base under 21 U.S.C. s 841(a)(1), 
841(b)(1)(a)(3).  On November 14, 2000 the district court 
sentenced Thompson to 188 months' imprisonment, followed 
by a four-year term of supervised release.

                                II

A.   Excluded Testimony

     At trial, Thompson's defense was that he lacked the requi-
site mens rea because he did not know the cup he delivered to 
Dessin contained cocaine base.  Thompson testified that be-
fore the transaction with Dessin, Douglas asked him to deliv-
er a Burger King cup that Douglas said contained $2600 to a 
Lexus in the Popeye's Chicken parking lot.  Thompson as-
sumed that the money was to pay a gambling debt because 
Douglas was a "compulsive gambler and owes people at 

times."  8/30/00 Tr. 21.  The government objected to Doug-
las's statements as hearsay.  The district court overruled the 
objection, explaining that the statements were offered for the 
non-hearsay purpose of "prov[ing] ... the defendant's state 
of mind."  8/30/00 Tr. 12.1  Thompson also tried to testify 
about what Douglas told him immediately after the event 
when he returned with the $1500 Dessin had given him.  
8/30/00 Tr. 23.  According to Thompson, the evidence was 
critical to his defense because it explained the otherwise 
unlikely sequence of events, that is, that Thompson received 
$1500 in exchange for what he thought was in the cup--
money to pay a gambling debt.  Appellant's Br. at 8.  Never-
theless the district court sustained the government's hearsay 
objection to any testimony regarding Douglas's post-
transaction statements.

     On appeal, Thompson argues that Douglas's post-
transaction statements, like Douglas's pre-transaction state-
ments, were offered to show Thompson's state of mind and 
therefore should not have been excluded as hearsay.2  Hear-
say is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the 
matter asserted.  Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).  An out-of-court 
statement that is offered to show its effect on the hearer's 
state of mind is not hearsay under Rule 801(c).  See United 
States v. Baird, 29 F.3d 647, 653 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (district 
court improperly excluded evidence bearing on officer's state 
of mind as hearsay);  United States v. Detrich, 865 F.2d 17, 21 
(2d Cir. 1988) (exclusion of evidence of defendant's state of 
mind as hearsay reversible error).  Regardless of the actual 
contents of the closed cup, the jury might have been able to 
draw from Douglas's statements an inference as to Thomp-
son's guilty knowledge vel non of the cup's contents.  If 
Thompson offered Douglas's post-transaction statements only 

__________
     1 The district court also offered to give a limiting instruction that 
the testimony could be "considered only with reference to the 
defendant's state of mind and [ ] not ... as evidence of the truth of 
what was, in fact, stated to him."  8/30/00 Tr. 12.

     2 We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of 
discretion.  See United States v. Warren, 42 F.3d 647, 655 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994).

as they might tend to bear on his state of mind, the testimony 
would not have been hearsay.3

     Rule 103(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, however, 
provides that an error may not be predicated upon a ruling 
excluding evidence unless "the substance of the evidence was 
made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the 
context within which questions were asked."  Fed. R. Evid. 
103(a)(2).  The proponent of excluded evidence must alert the 
trial court, in some fashion, to the substance of his proposed 
testimony.  See United States v. Lavelle, 751 F.2d 1266, 1272 
(D.C. Cir. 1985) (defendants's failure to make known basis for 
seeking to admit excluded evidence barred appellate review).4  
But defense counsel simply attempted unsuccessfully to re-
phrase his question and then finally moved on without appris-
ing the trial court of the substance of the excluded evidence.  
8/30/00 Tr. 22-23.5  Because Thompson did not proffer his 

__________
     3 On appeal, the government acknowledges that Douglas's state-
ments would not be hearsay if offered to show Thompson's state of 
mind.  Nonetheless, it contends the statements were properly 
excluded because they were "clearly irrelevant."  See Appellee's Br. 
at 12.  It suggests that statements made by Douglas to Thompson 
minutes after the transaction are irrelevant because they do not 
ascertain Thompson's state of mind at the time of the transaction.  
Id.  The fact that the statements occurred immediately after the 
event does not automatically mean that they were not probative of 
the defendant's intent.  Douglas's post-transaction statements to 
Thompson could tend to make Thompson's knowledge of what was 
in the cup "more or less probable."  See Fed. R. Evid. 401.

     4 In Lavelle, 751 F.2d at 1272 n.7, the court cited approvingly the 
Fifth Circuit decision in United States v. Winkle, 587 F.2d 710 (5th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 827 (1979), which established that 
appellate review of a trial court's exclusion of evidence requires that 
an offer of proof be made at trial.  Winkle, 587 F.2d at 710;  see 
also Stockstill v. Shell Oil Co., 3 F.3d 868, 872-73 (5th Cir. 1993), 
cert. denied 510 U.S. 1197 (1994).

     5 The relevant discussion at trial went as follows:

intended response or otherwise inform the court of the nature 
of the evidence sought to be adduced or, at minimum, the 
purpose for which the evidence was being offered, we are 
substantially hindered in reaching the conclusion that the 
district court erred.  See United States v. Wright, 783 F.2d 
1091, 1098-99 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (exclusion of threatening phone 
call as hearsay not error under Rule 103 because defendant 
failed to inform district court of nature of testimony);  see also 
Chedick v. Nash, 151 F.3d 1077, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (plain-
tiff's appeal of exclusion of emotional distress evidence fore-

     Q: [Defense Counsel] Then what happened after you asked 
     him, "Are you all right?"  You said, "Are you straight?"  What 
     happened?
     A: [Thompson] I got out of the car, and I left.  I went back 
     across the street towards Mitchell Douglass.  I was kind of 
     confused because I couldn't understand why this guy was 
     giving me money for money.  When I got across the street, my 
     first intention was to ask Mitchell what was in that cup.  But 
     when I got to him, he was sitting on the railing.  He looked like 
     he was a little upset about something.  I went over to him.  I 
     gave him the money.  And I sat on the rail beside him.  And 
     he told me that--

closed because of her failure to inform trial court of legal 
basis of admissibility).

     Even if a party fails to comply with Rule 103(a), review is 
nonetheless available under the "plain error" provision of 
Rule 103(d) which states, "[n]othing in this rule precludes 
taking notice of plain error affecting substantial rights al-
though they were not brought to the attention of the court."  
Fed. Evid. R. 103(d).  Under the plain error standard, "be-
fore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, 
there must be (1) 'error,' (2) that is 'plain,' and (3) that 
'affect[s] substantial rights.' "  United States v. Webb, 255 
F.3d 890, 897 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Johnson v. United 
States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997) (quotation omitted)).  "If 
all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then 
exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if 
(4) the error 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or 
public reputation of judicial proceedings.' "  Id. (quoting 
Johnson, 520 U.S. at 467).  Under this stringent standard, 
the district court's decision to exclude the post-event testimo-
ny did not constitute plain error affecting substantial rights 
because it did not "gravely hamper" Thompson's presentation 
of his mens rea defense.  Wright, 783 F.2d at 1099 (erroneous 
exclusion not plain error where duress defense nonetheless 
presented).  Reviewing Thompson's testimony, we note that 
he did testify that Douglas told him before the transaction 
that the cup contained money and that he was "confused" by 
Dessin's delivery of $1500 in exchange.  In the absence of a 
proffer showing otherwise, it appears the excluded testimony 
was cumulative.  In addition, the evidence of Thompson's 
guilt was fairly strong.  Most of the facts supporting his 
conviction were undisputed.  See supra 2-3.  The only disput-
ed issue at trial was whether Thompson knew that the cup 
contained cocaine base which, based on the evidence before it, 
the jury could reasonably find that he did.  Thompson thus 
incurred no significant prejudice from the erroneous ruling.  
We conclude therefore that the exclusion of the evidence did 
not constitute plain error and, accordingly, we affirm the 
district court's ruling.

B.   Aiding and Abetting Instruction

     Thompson next argues that the trial court erred by giving 
an aiding-and-abetting jury instruction that was unsupported 
by the evidence.  Thompson further contends that the erro-
neous instruction encouraged the jury to convict him without 
finding that he possessed the requisite criminal knowledge.  
We conclude that the instruction was proper or, at worst, 
harmless error.

     At trial, Thompson objected to the aiding-and-abetting 
instruction on the ground that the government failed to prove 
that Thompson and Douglas had a "shared intent" to commit 
the crime.  8/30/00 Tr. 79.  Thompson acknowledges that his 
challenge to the aiding-and-abetting instruction on appeal is 
based on a different ground from the one he asserted at trial.  
See Appellant's Br. at 13.  Objection to a jury instruction is 
properly made only if it is couched in terms that alert the 
trial court to the substance of the party's position.  See 
United States v. Breedlove, 204 F.3d 267, 270 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  
Because Thompson failed to object on the ground he asserts 
on appeal, he can prevail only if the instruction given consti-
tutes plain error.  See United States v. Halliman, 923 F.2d 
873, 885 (D.C. Cir. 1991);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 30;  Fed.
R.Crim.P. 52(b).  Accordingly, we review Thompson's claim 
on appeal for plain error.  See Webb, 255 F.3d at 897.

     At the outset, we believe that the trial court did not err in 
giving the instruction because the jury could have reasonably 
concluded, based on the evidence before it, that Thompson 
aided and abetted Douglas, the principal, in the distribution of 
cocaine base to Dessin.  Thompson is under the misconcep-
tion that because he physically handed the drugs to Dessin, 
he is the only person who could be a principal.  See Appel-
lant's Br. at 18.6  Douglas, however, was the original target of 

__________
     6 Thompson relies exclusively on the holding in United States v. 
Martin, 747 F.2d 1404, 1407 (11th Cir. 1984), that an aiding and 
abetting instruction can be reversible error if there is no evidence 
of any person other than the defendant culpably involved in the 
offense.  Id. at 1406.  The Tenth Circuit, interpreting Martin in 
circumstances like those here, concluded that an aiding and abetting 

the sting operation, set up the transaction with Dessin, ar-
ranged the location for the sale, provided the narcotics (and 
the cup to transport them), chose Thompson as his agent and 
was the financial beneficiary of the transaction.  Under these 
circumstances, the jury could have reasonably found that 
Thompson aided and abetted the distribution committed prin-
cipally by Douglas.  Cf. United States v. Edmonds, 765 
F. Supp. 1112 (D.D.C. 1991) (defendant not required to 
personally transfer drugs to undercover agent to support 
cocaine distribution conviction;  constructive transfer suffi-
cient), rev'd in part on other grounds, 69 F.3d 1172 (D.C. Cir. 
1995).7

     Even if there were no record evidence to support an aiding-
and-abetting instruction, the error would nonetheless be 
harmless.  Thompson's complaint, namely, that the instruc-
tion "invited the jury to find Thompson guilty as an 'aider and 
abettor' without requiring the jury to find that [he] possessed 
the requisite criminal knowledge," Reply Br. 12, is without 
merit in view of the instructions given as well as the govern-
ment's focus on the criminal state-of-mind issue.  The district 
court first laid out the requirements for the offense of posses-
sion with intent to distribute.8  The court then correctly 

__________
instruction is proper if there is evidence from which a reasonable 
jury could conclude that the defendant aided someone in committing 
arson.  See United States v. Yost, 24 F2d 99, 104 (10th Cir. 1994).

     7 21 U.S.C. s 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful "to ... distribute ... a 
controlled substance."  "[T]o distribute" means "to deliver," and 
"delivery" is defined as "the actual, constructive, or attempted 
transfer of a controlled substance, whether or not there exists an 
agency relationship."  21 U.S.C. s 802(8) and (11).  See also United 
States v. Waller, 503 F.2d 1014, 1015-16 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. 
denied, 420 U.S. 932 (1975) (rejecting defendant's argument that 
she did not distribute drugs because she did not physically hand 
them to buyer).  That Douglas did not physically transfer the drugs 
to Dessin is of no consequence because the evidence plainly sup-
ports Douglas's role as principal in the constructive distribution of a 
controlled substance.

     8 The court explained in part that:

advised the jury of the requirements of aider and abettor 
liability, repeatedly referring to the intent element.9  A rea-
sonable jury would understand that to convict Thompson, 
whether as principal or aider and abettor, the government 
had to prove that he had the requisite criminal state of mind.  
At oral argument, Thompson emphasized that the harm to 
him stemmed primarily from the government's use of the 
instruction.  We disagree.  In fact, the government empha-
sized the criminal intent element in its closing argument.  See 
8/30/00 Tr. 93-96.10  For the foregoing reasons, we reject 
Thompson's challenge to the jury charge.

C.   Sufficiency of Evidence

     Finally Thompson contends that his conviction should be 
reversed for insufficiency of intent evidence.  In reviewing a 

__________
     The essential elements of distribution of a controlled substance, 
     each of which the government must prove beyond a reasonable 
     doubt, are:  ...  2. That the defendant distributed the con-
     trolled substance knowingly and intentionally.  This means 
     consciously, voluntarily and on purpose, not mistakenly, acci-
     dentally or inadvertently.     
8/30/00 Tr. 123 (emphasis added).

     9 The court instructed the jury:

     Any person, who in some way intentionally participates in the 
     commission of a crime, aids and abets the principal offend-
     er....  To find that the defendant aided and abetted in 
     committing a crime, you must find that the defendant knowing-
     ly associated himself with the person who committed the crime, 
     that he participated in the crime as something he wished to 
     bring about, and that he intended by his actions to make it 
     succeed....  It is sufficient if you find beyond a reasonable 
     doubt that the crime was committed by someone and that the 
     defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted the 
     principal offender in committing the crime.
8/30/00 Tr. 124-25 (emphasis added).

     10 The government quoted the text of the instruction that the jury 
must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the "defendant knowingly 
and intentionally aided and abetted the principal offender in com-
mitting the crime."  8/30/00 Tr. 93.

conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, the court need only 
determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light 
most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact 
could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Logan, 998 F.2d 
1025, 1030 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  Thompson, however, has waived 
his right to raise a sufficiency of the evidence claim on appeal 
by failing to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the 
close of all of the evidence.  See United States v. Sherod, 960 
F.2d 1075, 1077 (D.C. Cir.) (failure to renew motion for 
acquittal at close of all evidence means there is "nothing to 
review"), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 980 (1992).  In Sherod, we 
endorsed an exception to the rule if declining to consider the 
sufficiency of the evidence on waiver grounds caused a "mani-
fest miscarriage of justice."  Id. (quotation omitted).  Be-
cause the record is not devoid of evidence pointing to Thomp-
son's knowledge of the cup's true contents, cf. United States 
v. Spinner, 152 F.3d 950, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Patel v. 
Penman, 103 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir. 1996), his case does not 
fit the exception and his conviction is affirmed.

                                                                      So ordered.
