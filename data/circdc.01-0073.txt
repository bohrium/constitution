      Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  As the world well knows, Califor-
nia restructured its electricity market a few years ago.  The 
current case arises out of a decision by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission approving certain proposals allocat-
ing decisionmaking power in the modified market.  In the 
fast-moving life of California's energy problems, all but one of 
the petitioners' claims have become moot.  For the remaining 
claim, the petitioners lack standing.

                              * * *

     The case revolves around three novel state entities devised 
to play key roles in the new structure:  (1) an Independent 
System Operator ("ISO"), which received control of certain 
power transmission assets from the state's three major inves-
tor-owned utilities and was charged with running a single 
statewide transmission grid;  (2) a Power Exchange ("PX"), 
which was to be responsible for matching electricity buyers 
and sellers in the California market;  (3) an Oversight Board, 
which (so far as is relevant here) was vested with review 
power over the composition of the ISO and PX boards and 
over decisions of the ISO Board.  See Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., 77 FERC p 61,204, at 61,796-98, 61,817 (1996) 
("1996 Order");  see also Cal. Pub. Util. Code ss 330-97 
(West 2000).

     In its 1996 Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion rejected some of the then pending California arrange-
ments.  The primary grounds, as relevant to present pur-
poses, were that the duties of the Oversight Board conflicted 

with the Commission's responsibilities under the Federal 
Power Act ("FPA") and with the "independence principle" 
previously adopted by the Commission in its Order No. 888, 
requiring that an ISO Board be independent of any market 
participant or group of participants.  1996 Order, 77 FERC 
at 61,817-18.  See also Order No. 888, Promoting Wholesale 
Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory 
Transmission Services by Public Utilities;  Recovery of 
Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utili-
ties, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,596 (1996), reprinted in, FERC 
Stats. & Regs. p 31,036, at 31,730-31 (setting forth indepen-
dence principle);  Atlantic City Electric Co., 77 FERC 
p 61,148, at 61,574 (1996) (affirming independence principle as 
"bedrock" policy).  Cf. Transmission Access Policy Study 
Group v. FERC, 225 F.3d 667, 738 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (upholding 
Order No. 888), cert. granted sub nom. New York v. FERC, 
2001 WL 178167 (2001).

     Three years later the Oversight Board sought the Commis-
sion's advance approval of provisions contained in a bill 
pending before the California Senate, SB 96.  See Joint 
Appendix ("J.A.") at 2.  The bill made several changes to the 
California restructuring, aimed at least in part at satisfying 
the Commission.  Various sections of the bill provided that 
the composition of the ISO and PX boards would "remain in 
effect until an agreement with a participating state is legally 
in effect."  Id. at 17-18;  see also id. at 6.  First, whereas 
formerly the Oversight Board was authorized to appoint all 
members to the ISO and PX stakeholder boards, SB 96 gave 
it only a veto power over proposed board members of speci-
fied types:  those "representing agricultural end-users, indus-
trial end-users, commercial end-users, residential end-users, 
end-users at large, nonmarket participants, and public inter-
est groups."  Id. at 16;  see also Cal. Pub. Util. Code s 335.  
Second, whereas members of the ISO and PX boards were 
previously required to be residents of California, SB 96 
instead mandated that they be "electricity customers in the 
area served by" the ISO or PX.  J.A. at 17;  see also Cal. 
Pub. Util. Code ss 337-38.  Third, whereas formerly the 
Oversight Board was slated to enjoy very broad appellate 

jurisdiction, SB 96 largely confined it to "[m]atters pertaining 
to retail electric service or retail sales of electric energy."  
J.A. at 18;  see also Cal. Pub. Util. Code s 339.

     The petitioners here--the Western Power Trading Forum 
(an organization of electricity generators and marketers, mu-
nicipal electric companies, power exchanges, and power mar-
keting administrations) and the Coalition of New Market 
Participants (an association of participants in the California 
electricity markets)--intervened before the Commission, 
claiming that the state legislation didn't adequately address 
the Commission's concerns about independence and jurisdic-
tion and effectively favored California consumers at the ex-
pense of out-of-state producers.  Over their objections the 
Commission found that SB 96 properly limited the Oversight 
Board's authority to matters within the state's jurisdiction--
"find[ing] that this interim role is acceptable in the unique 
circumstances presented by the restructuring of California 
electricity markets"--and granted the Oversight Board's pro-
posed declaratory order.  California Electricity Oversight 
Board, 88 FERC p 61,172, at 61,576 (1999) ("1999 Order").  
The Commission later denied rehearing, stressing that it had 
not ceded any authority or duties under the FPA.  California 
Electricity Oversight Board, 89 FERC p 61,134 (1999).  Peti-
tioners challenge these two orders.

     As a federal court, we can only adjudicate "actual, ongoing 
controversies."  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317 (1988).  
Most of this case has lost that character, thanks to a Commis-
sion order issued after initial briefing but before oral argu-
ment.  Recent California legislation, spurred by the state's 
energy crisis, has further mooted all but one of the petition-
ers' claims.  Since petitioners do not have standing to bring 
this remaining claim, we dismiss.

                              * * *

     Petitioners identify three alleged defects in SB 96.  First, 
they argue that, because the area served by the ISO and the 
PX does not extend beyond the borders of California, the 
requirement that ISO and PX board members be electricity 

customers in the area served by the ISO or the PX, see Cal. 
Pub. Util. Code ss 337-38, is really a "de facto California 
residency requirement" of exactly the sort rejected by the 
Commission's 1996 Order.  Petitioners' Br. at 35.  Second, 
they challenge as a violation of the independence principle the 
Oversight Board's veto power over confirmation of ISO and 
PX board members, especially those representing "nonmark-
et participants" and "public interest classes."  Petitioners' Br. 
at 30-33.  Third, they attack the curtailed appellate review 
power of the Oversight Board as still encroaching on the 
Commission's jurisdiction.  Petitioners' Br. at 36-37.

     A later order of the Commission, not explicitly claimed by 
petitioners to be a response to this litigation, has radically 
undermined the premises of these claims.  See United States 
v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953) (voluntary cessa-
tion of conduct alone does not moot a case);  Clarke v. United 
States, 915 F.2d 699, 705-06 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc) 
(changes wholly independent of litigative process do not fall 
under voluntary cessation doctrine).  On November 1, 2000 
the Commission proposed that the ISO's current stakeholder 
board be replaced with a seven-member non-stakeholder 
board and directed parties to file comments by November 22, 
2000.  San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy and 
Ancillary Services into Markets Operated by the California 
Independent System Operator and the California Power Ex-
change, 93 FERC p 61,121, at 61,364, 61,373 (2000) ("San 
Diego I").  And on December 15, 2000 the Commission 
followed through, ordering that "the ISO Governing Board be 
replaced with a non-stakeholder Board, and that the members 
selected to serve on the new Board be independent of market 
participants."  San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sellers of 
Energy and Ancillary Services into Markets Operated by the 
California Independent System Operator and the California 
Power Exchange, 93 FERC p 61,294, at 62,013 (2000) ("San 
Diego II").  The Commission further held that members of 
the current stakeholder ISO Board must "turn over decision-
making power and operating control to the management of 
the ISO" by January 29, 2001 (three days after oral argument 
of this case), retaining only an advisory role.  Id.  The 

Commission also stated its intention to establish further 
procedures "to discuss with state representatives the selec-
tion process for the new ISO Board."  Id.  The Commission 
did not similarly replace the PX's governing board.  Instead, 
by releasing the investor-owned utilities from the obligation 
to use the PX for energy exchange transactions and terminat-
ing the PX's rate schedules effective as of the close of the 
April 30, 2001 trading day, it essentially dissolved the PX.  
Id. at 61,999-62,000.

     The changes wrought by San Diego II moot the two claims 
that bear on the composition of the ISO Board--both the 
electricity purchase condition for membership and the provi-
sion for veto by the Oversight Board.  By limiting the ISO 
Board to an advisory role San Diego II pretty much defenes-
trates that board, id. at 62,013, and leaves to the Commis-
sion's own future rulings any decision of how the new-style 
board will be selected.

     The parallel attacks on the composition of the PX Board 
are also mooted, though the case is subtler.  By providing for 
termination of the PX itself, see id. at 61,999-62,000, San 
Diego II puts the PX Board on the road to oblivion.  Petition-
ers conceded at oral argument that the "Power Exchange ... 
under FERC's most recent orders is in the process of wind-
ing down and will be going out of business in the near 
future," but asserted that "unless and until it actually hap-
pens that it's not in business," their claims were not moot.  
Oral Argument Tr. at 23.  But "[t]o satisfy the Art. III case-
or-controversy requirement, a litigant must have suffered 
some actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable 
judicial decision."  Iron Arrow Honor Society v. Heckler, 464 
U.S. 67, 70 (1983).  Given the normal delays of this court's 
mandate (for purposes of allowing petitions for rehearing), 
and conventional agency delay, judicial resolution of the issue 
could not have the slightest real-world impact before April 30 
of this year, when the PX's rate schedules expire.  And the 
petitioners have not sought to show that the PX is likely to be 
revived.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 
(1983).

     The mootness wrought by San Diego II is, incidentally, 
amplified by legislation enacted by California on January 18, 
2001, Assembly Bill 5 ("An act to amend Sections 335 and 
341.2 of, to add Sections 352 and 352.5 to, and to repeal and 
add Section 337 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to 
public utilities, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take 
effect immediately") ("AB 5").  This act converted the exist-
ing ISO stakeholder governing board into a five-member non-
stakeholder board, with all members appointed by the Gover-
nor.  AB 5, s 3 (2001).  Five members, selected by the 
Governor and approved by the Oversight Board, took their 
posts three days before oral argument in this case.  See 
Letter from Vickie P. Whitney to Members of the Governing 
Board, California Independent System Operator (Jan. 23, 
2001)(submitted under Circuit Rule 28(j)).  As yet there has 
been no Commission evaluation of California's move.

     Petitioners' remaining challenge is to the undue breadth, as 
they see it, of the Oversight Board's power to review substan-
tive decisions of the ISO.  The Commission staunchly argues 
that San Diego II's changes also moot this claim, a proposi-
tion we find questionable.  Though changes in the criteria for 
membership on the ISO Board and the Oversight Board's role 
in its selection might be important elements of context, they 
seem to leave petitioners' core claim--the risk of Oversight 
Board invasion of federal authority--substantially in place.  
See Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Ass'n v. Nichols, 
142 F.3d 449, 458-459 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Naturist Society, Inc. 
v. Fillyaw, 958 F.2d 1515, 1520 (11th Cir. 1992).

     Whatever the answer on mootness for this final claim, 
another jurisdictional hurdle proves insuperable--the absence 
of standing.  Only a party that is "aggrieved" by a Commis-
sion's order may obtain judicial review, 16 U.S.C. s 825l, and 
this requires a petitioner to meet both the constitutional and 
prudential standing requirements.  Louisiana Energy and 
Power Authority v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364, 366 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  
Constitutional standing requires (among other things) an 
injury that is "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypo-
thetical."  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 
(1992) (internal quotations omitted).  Petitioners' best shot at 

showing the imminence of such an injury is their claim that 
the Oversight Board is by statute, and has shown itself in 
practice, biased in favor of the "people of California," and 
motivated "to shift costs and burdens to out-of-state market 
participants."  Petitioners' Br. at 19-20.  O'Shea v. Littleton, 
414 U.S. 488 (1974), suggests that under some circumstances 
the prospect of facing adverse action by a discriminatory or 
biased tribunal might be enough.  Petitioners submitted in 
support of their standing argument the transcript of an 
Oversight Board meeting, see Petitioners' Reply Br. Attach-
ment A at 3;  see also Northwest Environmental Defense 
Center v. Bonneville Power Administration, 117 F.3d 1520, 
1527 (9th Cir. 1997) (allowing affidavits to be submitted on 
appeal for the purpose of showing standing), from which one 
might perhaps infer such bias.  But as in O'Shea v. Littleton 
the claimed injury remains highly speculative.  The only 
prospective illegality claimed is that the Oversight Board 
might exercise review authority in a way (1) allowed by the 
1999 Order, but (2) unlawful under federal law.  At oral 
argument petitioners suggested only that the ISO Board 
could direct out-of-market purchases (discretionary purchases 
outside of set tariffs), and may itself be "bias[ed] to select the 
power, for instance, generated by the California municipal 
companies."  Oral Argument Tr. at 21.  Yet petitioners fail to 
trace this conduct in any way to the review power of the 
Oversight Board, much less to an illegal excess in the scope of 
that power deriving from the 1999 Order.  Cf. Metcalf v. 
National Petroleum Council, 553 F.2d 176, 186-87 (D.C. 
1977) (consumers asserting that composition of federal adviso-
ry committee would lead to higher costs for petroleum prod-
ucts lacked standing because the occurrence of the harm was 
"speculative and conjectural").

                              * * *

     The California electricity market is in flux.  The ISO 
stakeholder board, which allegedly threatened the interests of 
non-California power producers, no longer exists;  San Diego 
I & II replace it--as a matter of federal law--with a pro-
posed seven-member non-stakeholder board to be constituted 

in an as yet undetermined way (and as a matter of state law 
AB 5 replaces it with a five-member non-stakeholder board 
appointed by Governor Gray Davis).  Petitioners tell us that 
the various boards involved in the orders under review have 
in fact made decisions that undercut the pollyannish view of 
them (as petitioners see it) taken by the Commission.  If so, 
there may be remedies in the courts or before the Commis-
sion.  (The Commission could, for example, seek enforcement 
of San Diego II in a United States district court, see 16 
U.S.C. s 825m, and there may be Commission proceedings by 
which petitioners could try to induce such action.)  But no 
Commission decision taking or refusing to take such action is 
before us;  petitioners identify no way in which our review of 
the disputed decisions could remedy the alleged ill effects of 
California's current institutional arrangements--other than, 
perhaps, by "sending a message."  But message-sending is 
not among our powers under Article III.
