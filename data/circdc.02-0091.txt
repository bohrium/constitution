          Appeal from the United States District Court 
                  for the District of Columbia 
                        (No. 89cr00036-03)

     Kevin M. Schad argued the cause and filed the brief for 
petitioner.

     Patricia A. Heffernan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued the 
cause for respondent.  With her on the brief were Roscoe C. 
Howard Jr., U.S. Attorney, John R. Fisher and Roy W. 
McLeese III, Assistant U.S. Attorneys.  Mary-Patrice 
Brown, Assistant U.S. Attorney, entered an appearance.

     Before:  Henderson, Randolph and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  For Richard A. Smith, the remedy 
afforded under 28 U.S.C. s 2255 is inadequate.  Seeking 

authorization to file a second motion under 28 U.S.C. s 2255, 
as amended by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA")1, Smith demonstrates that 
his conviction under 18 U.S.C. s 924(c) is unlawful in view of 
the court's interpretation of the substantive provisions of that 
statute.  Nevertheless, the government contends, he fails to 
make a prima facie showing under 28 U.S.C. s 2244(b)(3)(C) 
as s 2255 requires.  Smith has an alternative remedy, the 
government urges, under 28 U.S.C. s 2241, and he is confined 
in a district located in a circuit in which, the government 
advises, he should prevail.  Accordingly, we deny the applica-
tion for authorization to file a second s 2255 motion in the 
district court without reaching the question whether, as Smith 
contends, there is an "actual innocence" exception to AEDPA.

                                I.

     Following the affirmance of his conviction for drug and 
weapon offenses, United States v. Harris, 959 F.2d 246 (D.C. 
Cir. 1992), Smith filed a motion under s 2255, seeking vaca-
tion of his conviction under 18 U.S.C. s 924(c) in light of 
Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995).  He with-
drew that motion, with permission of the district court.  Nine 
months later Smith filed a motion under s 2255 motion 
seeking relief on the ground that the act of trading drugs for 
guns did not constitute a violation of s 924(c).  The district 
denied the motion, and this court, in 1999, denied Smith's 
request for a certificate of appealability.  The following year, 
Smith filed his present request for authorization to file a 
second s 2255 motion in the district court in view of United 
States v. Stewart, 246 F.3d 728 (D.C. Cir. 2001), which held, in 
light of Bailey's clarification that "use" under s 924(c)(1) 
means "active employment of the firearm by the defendant," 
that the receipt of a gun during a drug transaction is not an 
offense under s 924(c).  See id. at 733.

     There is no question that Smith's s 924(c) conviction is no 
longer valid.  In Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993), 
the Supreme Court held that the defendant's offer to sell his 

__________

gun for narcotics constituted "use" of the gun under 924(c).  
See id. at 228-29.  Then, in Bailey, the Court not only 
clarified that "active employment" is required under s 924(c), 
but stated that a firearm can be used without being carried 
when a defendant displays or barters a firearm without 
handling it.  See Bailey, 516 U.S. at 146.  This court, in turn, 
held in Stewart that merely "receiving" a gun during a drug 
transaction is not active employment because the "recipient 
has not employed the gun, availed himself of the gun, or 
derived any service from the gun by simply trading his drugs 
for it."  Stewart, 246 F.3d at 731.  The court contrasted the 
facts in Stewart where the defendant had "bartered for a 
firearm" with the fact in Smith that the defendant had 
"barter[ed] with a firearm," using his gun to trade it for 
cocaine.  See Stewart, 246 F.3d at 731-32.  The court thus 
adopted the view expressed by the Seventh Circuit in United 
States v. Westmoreland, 122 F.2d 431, 435 (7th Cir. 1997), 
that "there is no grammatically correct way to express that a 
person receiving a payment is thereby 'using' the payment."  
See Stewart, 246 F.3d at 731-32 (quoting Westmoreland, 122 
F.3d at 435).  Like the defendant in Stewart, Smith received 
guns in exchange for drugs that he and his co-defendant sold.  
See Harris, 959 F.2d at 258.  Because Stewart "is an authori-
tative statement of what the statute meant before as well as 
after [its holding]," Smith is entitled to benefit from the 
Stewart interpretation of s 924(c).  See United States v. 
McKie, 73 F.3d 1149, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting Rivers v. 
Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1994)).

     Under the language of the AEDPA statute, however, this 
court's jurisdiction is limited to considering whether an appli-
cation for authorization to file a second s 2255 motion in the 
district court makes a prima facie showing that the petitioner 
is entitled to relief;  only the district court has jurisdiction to 
determine the merits of the motion once the circuit authorizes 
it.  See 28 U.S.C. s 2255 p 8;  id. s 2244(b)(3)(A)-(D);  Felker 
v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996);  Corrao v. United States, 
152 F.3d 188, 191 (2d Cir. 1998);  U.S. v. Bennett, 119 F.3d 
468, 470 (7th Cir. 1997).  To obtain authorization to file a 
second s 2255 motion, "a second or successive motion must 

be certified ... to contain--(1) newly discovered evidence 
...;  or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive 
to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was 
previously unavailable."  28 U.S.C. s 2255 p 8.  Our decision 
in Stewart does not constitute new evidence.  See In re 
Dorsainvil, 119 F.3d 245, 247 (3d Cir. 1997).  Neither is it a 
new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Su-
preme Court.  See Tyler v. Cain, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2482 (2001).  
Although the Supreme Court has ruled that Bailey is to be 
retroactive, Bailey is a rule of statutory interpretation, not of 
constitutional law.  See Bousley v. U.S., 523 U.S. 614, 620 
(1998).

     The savings clause of s 2255 provides that if the "remedy 
by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of 
his detention," the prisoner may utilize s 2241 to collaterally 
attack the legality of his conviction or sentence.  See 28 
U.S.C. s 2255 p 5.  Varying standards have been adopted by 
the circuits for determining when s 2255 is "inadequate or 
ineffective."  See Reyes-Requena v. U.S., 243 F.3d 893, 903-
04 (5th Cir. 2001) (surveying cases).  See also In re Jones, 
226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir. 2000);  Wofford v. Scott, 177 
F.3d 1236, 1244 & n.3 (11th Cir. 1999);  United States v. 
Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 52 (1st Cir. 1999);  Triestman v. United 
States, 124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir. 1997);  In re Dorsainvil, 119 
F.3d at 251-52 (3d Cir.);  cf. United States v. Hanser, 123 
F.3d 922, 929-30 (6th Cir. 1997).  Suffice it for the instant 
case, the Seventh Circuit has explained that s 2255 "can 
fairly be termed inadequate when it is so configured as to 
deny a convicted defendant any opportunity for judicial recti-
fication of so fundamental a defect in his conviction as having 
been imprisoned for a nonexistent offense."  In re Davenport, 
147 F.3d 605, 611 (7th Cir. 1998).  The government states 
that this is just such a case.  See Respondent's Br. at 22-25;  
Respondent's Supplemental Br. at 4, 6-7.  Smith is actually 
innocent, having been convicted on the basis of an incorrect 
understanding of s 924(c), and s 2255 relief is unavailable to 
him.

     Smith may therefore file a petition for a writ of habeas 
corpus under 28 U.S.C. s 2241 in the district in which he is 

confined.  See, e.g., In re Nwanze, 242 F.3d 521, 525 (3d Cir. 
2001);  Lee v. Wetzel, 244 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir. 2001);  In re 
Jones, 226 F.3d at 334;  Barrett, 178 F.3d at 50 n.10;  In re 
Davenport, 147 F.3d at 611-12;  Triestman, 124 F.3d at 380;  
Dorsainvil, 199 F.3d at 252.  Smith maintains that the Sev-
enth Circuit, wherein he is confined, will deny him relief 
under s 2241 in view of 28 U.S.C. s 2244(a), which prohibits a 
writ of habeas corpus if "the legality of such detention has 
been determined by a judge or court ... on a prior applica-
tion for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 
2255," 28 U.S.C. s 2244(a).  But the Seventh Circuit held in 
Davenport that a prisoner in similar circumstances as Smith 
is eligible to use the safety valve of s 2255 to file a petition 
under s 2241.  See Davenport, 147 F.3d at 610, 612.

     Regarding s 924(c), the Seventh Circuit has held, in view of 
the Supreme Court's decision in Bailey, that passively receiv-
ing a gun for drugs does not constitute "use" of a gun in a 
drug offense under s 924(c).  See Westmoreland, 122 F.3d at 
435.  In that case, the defendant received a gun from an 
undercover agent.  The Seventh Circuit observed that "the 
defendant is on the passive side of the bargain.  He received 
the gun.  He was paid with the gun.  He accepted the gun.  
But in no sense did he actively 'use' the gun....  A seller 
does not 'use' a buyer's consideration."  Id. at 435-36.  Al-
though the Seventh Circuit noted that it "might well" view 
the case differently had the transaction occurred between two 
defendants, as the government could conceivably charge the 
party receiving the gun with aiding and abetting the party 
supplying it, id. at 436 n.1, our decision confirming Smith's 
convictions does not indicate that the government charged 
Smith with aiding and abetting, see Harris, 959 F.2d at 259-
60, and the government makes no such representation here 
that he was.

     The Seventh Circuit also left open how it would view a case 
where the defendant requested the gun in payment for the 
drugs.  See Westmoreland, 122 F.3d at 436 n.1. In his 1999 
application for a certificate of appealability, Smith referred to 
testimony of the informant and the police to the effect that he 
and his co-defendant Harris did not participate in the request 

for drugs.  But see Harris, 959 F.2d at 249.  Be that as it 
may, the government, in urging this court to invoke the safety 
clause of s 2255, and thereby avoid addressing potential 
constitutional issues that might arise were there no "actual 
innocence" exception to AEDPA, has stated that under West-
moreland, "Seventh Circuit law should permit petitioner to 
raise, and to prevail upon, his Section 924(c) claim."  Respon-
dent's Supplemental Br. at 15.  The court takes at face value 
the government's representation, for the government will be 
bound to argue in support of relief for Smith in the Seventh 
Circuit.  See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742 (2001).  
Should the government's interpretation of Seventh Circuit 
law prove to be mistaken, Smith then may renew his conten-
tion in this court that there is an "actual innocence" exception 
under AEDPA.

     Accordingly, because Smith's other claim, that his life 
sentence must be vacated pursuant to Appendi v. New Jer-
sey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), also fails to establish a prima facie 
showing, for the Supreme Court has not made Apprendi 
retroactive for purposes of collateral review and the jury in 
Harris was instructed to find the amount of drugs, we deny 
the application for authorization to file a second s 2255 
motion in the district court without reaching the question 
whether there is an "actual innocence" exception to AEDPA.
