     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Tasty Baking Company (TBC) 
petitions this court for review of a decision and order of the 
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The Board found 
that the company committed unfair labor practices in viola-
tion of sections (8)(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Rela-
tions Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1), (3).  TBC alleges 
that part of the complaint filed by the NLRB's General 
Counsel was time-barred, that the hearing conducted by the 
Board's Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) was procedurally 
flawed, that the Board's factual conclusions are unsupported, 
and that the Board's prescribed remedy is improper.  We 
reject these challenges and grant the Board's cross-
application for enforcement of its order.

                                I

     TBC operates a plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where 
approximately 700 workers produce baked goods on daytime 
and overnight shifts.  In 1994, Teamsters Union Local 115 
began an organizing drive among TBC employees.  The union 
lost a representation election in April 1995, but, upon the 
union's objection, the Board set aside the results and ordered 
a new election in March 1996.

     The events forming the basis of the present case began in 
the summer of 1995, after the first representation election.  
In mid-June, Production Operations Director Thomas Kenney 
demoted Edwina Flannery, the wife of well-known union 
activist and "oven man" Michael Flannery,1 from the supervi-
sory position she had held for nearly five years.  This demo-
tion took place despite management's recent assurances that

ovens, coordinates the oven heating times with the floor monitor 
and the operator of the crumbs depositor, and ensures that the 
baked product is carried away on a conveyor belt.

her position was safe and that she was the company's "newest 
rising star."  Tr. at 185.  On August 10, 1995, after Edwina 
Flannery's demotion, Superintendent Charles Britsch told her 
that the fact that her husband was outside the plant distribut-
ing union literature "was not helping [her] chances of staying 
on day work," and that if he continued she "could very 
seriously end up on night work."  Id. at 200.  Michael 
Flannery continued leafleting, and a month later the company 
transferred his wife to the night shift.

     On January 16, 1996, Michael Flannery received a disciplin-
ary warning from his supervisor, alleging that Flannery had 
twice failed to remove crumbs from the crumbs depositor.2  
Flannery filed a written grievance, protesting that it was not 
his responsibility to remove the crumbs.  When Flannery met 
with Britsch to discuss the grievance on January 18, Britsch 
said that the warning stemmed from the company's new "get 
tough" policy.  Id. at 124-25.  Britsch also said that he and 
Flannery were "enemies," and that while Flannery might 
think that he was doing the right thing for the employees, 
Britsch felt that he (Britsch) was "doing the right thing for 
Tasty Bake and will do whatever I have to to keep the union 
out."  Id. at 125.

     On January 26, 1996, Operations Director Kenney met with 
an employee, William Martin, to discuss Martin's suggestion 
that metal detectors be installed at the entrance to the 
workplace.  Kenney told Martin that the suggestion was 
"stupid," and speculated that Michael Flannery was behind it.  
Id. at 220.  Martin denied this, and then told Kenney that 
Michael Flannery should not have received the "crumbs" 
warning because it was Martin's, not Flannery's, responsibili-
ty to remove the crumbs from the depositor.  Kenney re-
sponded that he did not care whose job it was, and "that he 
had told Mike that if Mike f**ked him, he would f**k Mike 
back."  Id. at 221.  Kenney then told Martin that "if you f**k

me, I'll f**k you back," and concluded:  "[N]ow I'm getting 
Mike.  I told him I was going to do it.  Now I'm doing it."  
Id. at 221-22.

     On January 31, 1996, sanitation employee Robert Nolan, 
another vocal union supporter, received a three-day suspen-
sion and was subsequently issued a written warning for 
"insubordination" resulting from an incident with Linda Ca-
sey, a substitute floor monitor.  According to Nolan, he had 
been making a telephone call during his usual break time, 
when Casey began "yelling and screaming" at him to get off 
the phone.  Id. at 278.  Nolan told Casey that he was talking 
to his wife, and asked to see his regular floor monitor.  Casey 
refused to let Nolan explain or see his monitor, and instructed 
him to get off the phone and return to work, which Nolan did.  
Nolan testified that thereafter his regular monitor told him 
not to worry about the incident.  Nonetheless, Nolan received 
a written warning and three-day suspension for insubordina-
tion.

     On April 11, 1996, Kenney approached Michael Flannery 
during his shift and said:  "[I] don't believe you.  After what 
happened to your wife, you're still pushing the union and 
calling OSHA [the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration].  Are you going to make me fire you?"  Id. at 127.  
Two months later, on June 6, 1996, Flannery received a 
written warning for reporting wrong "oven times" to other 
employees.  Flannery received the warning notwithstanding 
that he had disputed the allegation and been told that he 
would merely receive a memo to his file.

     Between August 1995 and July 1996, the union filed unfair 
labor practice charges with the NLRB concerning the above-
described events.  Those charges resulted in separate com-
plaints filed by the Board's General Counsel, which were 
eventually consolidated for hearing.  The complaints charged 
that the company had violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the 
NLRA, which make it an unfair labor practice for an employ-
er:  "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the 
exercise of" their rights to form, join, or assist labor organiza-
tions, 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1);  see id. s 157, and "by discrimi-

nation in regard to ... any term or condition of employment 
to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organi-
zation," id. s 158(a)(3).  After a hearing, the ALJ sustained 
the complaints with respect to the charges that are the 
subject of the instant petition, and the company filed excep-
tions with the Board.

     The NLRB affirmed the ALJ's conclusions with minor 
modifications.  Tasty Baking Co. and Teamsters Union Local 
115, 330 N.L.R.B. No. 80, 2000 WL 127513 (Jan. 31, 2000) 
("Tasty Baking Co.").  The Board found that TBC violated 
section 8(a)(1) by:  (1) telling Michael Flannery that the 
company had implemented a "get tough policy" in response to 
his union activities;  (2) threatening William Martin with 
retaliation if he engaged in union activities;  and (3) threaten-
ing Michael Flannery with discharge because of his union 
activities and calls to OSHA.  The NLRB also found that 
TBC committed unfair labor practices in violation of sections 
8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by:  (1) issuing a written warning to 
Michael Flannery for the "crumbs" incident;  (2) issuing a 
three-day suspension and written warning to Robert Nolan 
for alleged insubordination in connection with the telephone 
incident;  and (3) issuing a written warning to Michael Flan-
nery for the "oven times" incident.  Finally, the Board found 
that the company violated section 8(a)(1) by demoting Edwina 
Flannery from her supervisory position in retaliation for her 
husband's union activities, and violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) 
by transferring Edwina Flannery to the night shift because 
her husband continued working for the union.

     The company petitions for review.  It contends that the 
General Counsel's complaint concerning Edwina Flannery's 
demotion is time-barred because it was not "closely related" 
to any charge that was timely filed with the NLRB.  TBC 
also alleges that certain of its procedural rights were violated 
during the hearing conducted by the ALJ.  The company 
further argues that substantial evidence does not support any 
of the Board's findings that the company committed unfair 
labor practices.  Finally, TBC challenges the Board's authori-

ty to order reinstatement of Edwina Flannery to her supervi-
sory position.

                                II

     The company contends that the complaint concerning Ed-
wina Flannery's demotion was time-barred under NLRA 
s 10(b), 29 U.S.C. s 160(b), which states that "no complaint 
shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring 
more than six months prior to the filing of the charge."  TBC 
notes that the NLRB has construed section 10(b) to permit 
prosecution of an alleged violation that was not timely 
charged if it is "closely related" to the allegations in a timely 
filed charge.  See TBC Br. at 7-8 (citing Nickles Bakery of 
Indiana, Inc., 296 N.L.R.B. 927, 928 (1989)).  TBC contends 
that the allegation concerning Edwina Flannery's June 1995 
demotion fails the "closely related" test.

     The initial charge was timely filed on October 16, 1995, and 
stated that the company had unlawfully "demot[ed] an em-
ployee for supporting and associating with the union."  J.A. 
838.  On February 12, 1996, the General Counsel filed a 
complaint based upon that charge, specifically alleging that 
Edwina Flannery was demoted from her position as "supervi-
sor" because of the union activities of one of her relatives.  
J.A. 832.  TBC argues, citing Drug Plastics & Glass Co. v. 
NLRB, 44 F.3d 1017, 1021, (D.C. Cir. 1995), that the Febru-
ary 1996 complaint was not "closely related" to the October 
1995 charge, because the complaint referred to a demoted 
"supervisor"  while the charge had referred to a demoted 
"employee."  TBC notes that these words--"supervisor" and 
"employee"--have distinct meanings under the NLRA, see 29 
U.S.C. s 152(3), and it argues that because different legal 
theories and defenses apply to the demotion of supervisors 
and employees,  the allegations cannot be regarded as "close-
ly related."  See TBC Br. at 13-16 (citing Nickles Bakery, 
296 N.L.R.B. 927).

     Far from failing the "closely related" test, however, we 
think the complaint and charge are fairly read--notwithstand-
ing the technical imprecision of the charge--as identifying the 

very same conduct.  The actual thrust of TBC's argument is 
that the timely charge did not give the company "fair notice 
of the acts alleged to constitute the unfair labor practice."  
Pergament United Sales, Inc. v. NLRB, 920 F.2d 130, 134 (2d 
Cir. 2000).  We conclude that it did.

     As the Board explained, the term "employee," used in its 
generic rather than NLRA-specific sense, can certainly refer 
to someone employed as a supervisor.  Tasty Baking Co., slip 
op. at 1.3  Moreover, other allegations in the same timely filed 
charging document made clear that it was Edwina Flannery 
who was the referenced "employee."  That document alleged 
that the company had "depriv[ed] an employee of seniority 
rights" and "transferr[ed] an employee to the night shift"--
both of which the company had done to Flannery (and, as far 
as the record reflects, only to Flannery) soon after it demoted 
her from her supervisory position.  This additional informa-
tion was more than sufficient to give TBC fair notice of the 
charge against it.  See NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph 
Co., 304 U.S. 333, 349-50 (1938) (holding that the discrepancy 
between a charge alleging discriminatory refusal to reinstate, 
and the Board's finding of discriminatory discharge, did not 
violate the company's due process rights).  Compare Perga-
ment United Sales, Inc., 920 F.2d at 135-36 (granting en-
forcement of an NLRB order where the Board had charged 
the employer with violating section 8(a)(3), but ultimately 
found it to have violated section 8(a)(4) with respect to the 
same employees), with Lotus Suites, Inc. v. NLRB, 32 F.3d 
588, 592 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (denying enforcement where the 
charge contained only a "boilerplate allegation that the Em-
ployer violated s 8(a)(1) and [was] utterly lacking in factual 
specificity").

                               III

     TBC next argues that procedural irregularities in the com-
plaint and hearing before the ALJ require us to set aside the 

__________
     3 Indeed, by the time the charge was filed in October 1995, 
Edwina Flannery had already been demoted and was thus an 
"employee" in both the generic and NLRA-specific senses.

NLRB's findings regarding threats Kenney and Britsch made 
to employees.  TBC argues that those findings should be set 
aside because the General Counsel's complaint did not put the 
company on notice of the conduct at issue, and because the 
ALJ improperly sequestered Kenney and Britsch during the 
proceeding, preventing them from hearing the allegations 
that union witnesses made against them.  TBC claims that 
these irregularities violated both due process and NLRB 
rules.  We disagree.  See Pergament United Sales, Inc., 920 
F.2d at 134 (holding that "due process is satisfied when a 
complaint gives a respondent fair notice ... and when the 
conduct implicated in the alleged violation has been fully and 
fairly litigated").

     The company's principal challenge to the complaint is that 
it alleged that Kenney and Britsch threatened employees on 
dates different from those proven at the hearing.  The com-
plaint alleged that Kenney made a threat "on or about" 
January 12, 1996, while the evidence showed that Kenney's 
threat to William Martin took place two weeks later, on 
January 26.  Similarly, the complaint alleged a threat made 
by Britsch "on or about" January 24, 1996, while the evidence 
concerned statements he made to Michael Flannery six days 
earlier, on January 18.  These minor variances in "on or 
about" dates, however, were insufficient to prejudice the 
company's hearing preparation.  Indeed, courts have permit-
ted variances of the same and greater magnitude between 
dates charged in criminal indictments and those later proven 
at trial, notwithstanding that in such cases the defendant's 
very liberty is at stake.  See, e.g., United States v. Kimberlin, 
18 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (4th Cir. 1994) (finding nonprejudicial a 
variance of nearly one month between the date charged in the 
indictment and that proven at trial);  Robinson v. United 
States, 210 F.2d 29, 31 (D.C. Cir. 1954) (holding that "[t]here 
is no material variance between March 16 and 'about March 
1' ").  Moreover, at the hearing itself, TBC had a full opportu-
nity to cross-examine the General Counsel's witnesses about 
the circumstances surrounding the threats, and to put Ken-
ney and Britsch on the stand to rebut those witnesses.  See 
Pergament United Sales, Inc., 920 F.2d at 136.

     The company also challenges the manner in which the ALJ 
applied the NLRB's sequestration rule, under which an ALJ 
may exclude witnesses from the hearing room while others 
are testifying.  Exempt from the rule are, inter alia, a party's 
designated representative and "a person who is shown by a 
party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause."  
Greyhound Lines, Inc., 319 N.L.R.B. 554, 554 (1995);  see 
Fed. R. Evid. 615(3) (same).  The purpose of the rule is to 
prevent one witness from "shaping his testimony to match 
that given by other witnesses at the trial."  Queen v. Wash. 
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 842 F.2d 476, 481 (D.C. Cir. 1998) 
(citations omitted).

     TBC selected its Vice President for Human Resources, 
William Mahoney, as its designated representative to assist in 
its defense, and the ALJ excepted him from sequestration.  
The ALJ excluded four other company managers from the 
hearing room, including Kenney and Britsch.  The company 
argues that the exclusion of Kenney and Britsch was improp-
er, because they were "essential" witnesses.  The ALJ re-
tains considerable discretion in determining which witnesses 
are "essential" within the meaning of the rule, however, and 
we find no abuse of that discretion here.  Cf. Polythane Sys. 
v. Marina Ventures Int'l, 993 F.2d 1201, 1209-10 (5th Cir. 
1993) (holding that whether a witness is "essential" under 
Fed. R. Evid. 615 is "a matter soundly within the discretion of 
the trial court");  Queen, 842 F.2d at 482 (same).

     Moreover, we are unable to discern any prejudice suffered 
by the company on account of the sequestration.  See Brick-
layers Int'l Union of Am. v. NLRB, 475 F.2d 1316, 1323 (D.C. 
Cir. 1973) (noting that under 5 U.S.C. s 706, "due account 
shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error").  Under the 
NLRB's rule, "counsel for a party may inform counsel's own 
witness of the content of testimony ... given by a witness for 
the opposing side in order to prepare for rebuttal of such 
testimony."  Greyhound Lines, Inc., 319 N.L.R.B. at 554.  In 
light of company counsel's ability thus to prepare Kenney and 
Britsch, and of the fact that both men did testify in rebuttal 
to the General Counsel's witnesses, such prejudice seems 
highly unlikely.  See Desert Hosp. v. NLRB, 91 F.3d 187, 190 

(D.C. Cir. 1996) ("The burden of showing prejudice from 
assertedly erroneous rulings is on the party claiming inju-
ry.").

     TBC offers only one example of such purported prejudice.  
It contends that the ALJ wrongly interpreted Kenney's un-
certainty about details of his meeting with Martin as evidence 
of Kenney's lack of credibility.  The true reason for Kenney's 
uncertainty, the company argues, is that the complaint al-
leged a meeting date that was off by two weeks, and that the 
sequestration order prevented Kenney from hearing Martin's 
description of that meeting.  But even if this contention were 
true, Kenney's uncertain description of the meeting with 
Martin was the last and least important of the grounds the 
ALJ gave for doubting Kenney's credibility.  The ALJ found 
Kenney's responses vague with respect to numerous other 
incidents;  found that although he had no difficulty remember-
ing events when questioned on direct examination by compa-
ny counsel, he had inexplicable failures of memory when 
under cross-examination;  and found Kenney generally "eva-
sive" in responding to questions from the General Counsel.  
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 20.  Moreover, in concluding 
that Kenney had threatened Martin, the ALJ principally 
relied not on the vagueness of Kenney's testimony, but on the 
fact that his testimony was inconsistent and at points self-
contradictory, while Martin testified "in an honest and truth-
ful manner."  Id. at 13.  In sum, even were the complaint 
misleading and the sequestration order erroneous, the compa-
ny could not fairly blame those factors for the ALJ's finding 
that Kenney unlawfully threatened William Martin.

                                IV

     TBC also disputes the Board's findings that the company 
committed unfair labor practices on the ground that those 
findings are not supported by substantial evidence.  Our role 
in reviewing such a claim is limited.  Pioneer Hotel, Inc., 182 
F.3d at 942.  We must uphold the findings of the Board as 
long as they are "supported by substantial evidence on the 
record considered as a whole."  29 U.S.C. s 160(e).  In 

making that determination, "we ask only whether on this 
record it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to 
reach the Board's conclusion[,].... and we give substantial 
deference to the inferences drawn by the NLRB from the 
facts."  Halle Enters., Inc. v. NLRB, 247 F.3d 268, 271 (D.C. 
Cir. 2001) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  More-
over, we "must accept the ALJ's credibility determinations 
..., as adopted by the Board, unless they are patently 
insupportable."  Gold Coast Rest. Corp. v. NLRB, 995 F.2d 
257, 265 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotations 
omitted).  We apply this standard of review to each of the 
findings challenged by the company.

                                A

     We first consider TBC's challenge to the Board's findings 
that three threats made by the company's supervisors to 
Michael Flannery and William Martin violated section 8(a)(1) 
of the Act.  That section forbids coercive statements that 
threaten retaliation against employees for the exercise of 
their rights to organize and to participate in union activities.  
See Southwire Co. v. NLRB, 820 F.2d 453, 457 (D.C. Cir. 
1987).  An employer's statement violates the NLRA if, con-
sidering the totality of the circumstances, the statement has a 
reasonable tendency to coerce or to interfere with those 
rights.  See Avecor, Inc. v. NLRB, 931 F.2d 924, 931 (D.C. 
Cir. 1991).

     The Board found a section 8(a)(1) violation based upon 
Britsch's statements to Michael Flannery on January 18, 
when Flannery met with Britsch to discuss his grievance over 
the "crumbs" warning.  According to Flannery, Britsch told 
him that the warning stemmed from the company's new "get 
tough" policy, which had been instituted because too many 
people were "screwing up."  Tr. at 124-25;  see Tasty Baking 
Co., slip op. at 9.  Britsch said that Flannery and he were 
"enemies over this," and that while Flannery might think that 
he was doing the right thing for the employees, Britsch felt 
that he (Britsch) was "doing the right thing for Tasty Bake 
and will do whatever I have to to keep the union out."  Tr. at 

125;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 9.  The ALJ recognized 
that "if viewed in isolation, Britsch's mention to [Michael] 
Flannery of a new 'get tough' policy and about people 'screw-
ing up' is arguably subject to more than one interpretation."  
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 14.  He concluded, however, 
that in context, "Flannery could reasonably have construed 
Britsch's remarks to mean that the warning issued to him 
was part of Britsch's admitted strategy of doing what it took 
to keep the Union out, and as a threat that he and other 
union supporters faced further reprisals under [the] ... new 
'get tough' policy should they persist in their union efforts."  
Id.

     Although TBC suggests that this conversation may never 
have occurred, Flannery's testimony--found credible by the 
ALJ--provides substantial evidence that it did.  Indeed, 
Britsch conceded that the conversation did occur and did not 
deny the truth of Flannery's version;  Britsch simply testified 
that he did not specifically remember what was said.  Tr. at 
420;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 14.  TBC further 
contends that if the conversation did occur, it was equally 
plausible that the references to people "screwing up" and to 
the new "get tough" policy had nothing to do with union 
activity.  While this may be so, we must uphold the Board's 
findings as long as they rest upon reasonable inferences, and 
we may not reject them simply because other reasonable 
inferences may also be drawn.  See Halle Enters., Inc., 247 
F.3d at 271.  In this case, the Board's inference that Britsch's 
statements constituted a threat of anti-union reprisal is a 
reasonable one.

     The second threat found by the Board occurred on January 
26, 1996.  On that date, William Martin told Kenney that 
Michael Flannery should not have received the "crumbs" 
warning, because it was Martin's responsibility as operator of 
the crumbs depositor, not Flannery's responsibility as oven 
man, to remove the crumbs from the depositor.  According to 
Martin, Kenney replied that he did not care whose job it was.  
Kenney said that he "had told Mike that if Mike f**ked him, 
he would f**k Mike back," and that "[n]ow I'm doing it."  Tr. 
at 221-22;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 13.  Kenney also 

warned Martin that "if you f**k me, I'll f**k you back."  Tr. 
at 221;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 13.

     Martin's testimony, judged "honest and truthful" by the 
ALJ, Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 13, provides substantial 
evidence that the conversation occurred as Martin recounted.  
And Kenney's statement, that actual culpability for the 
crumbs incident was irrelevant to which employee had been 
disciplined, supports the ALJ's finding that Martin "could 
reasonably have concluded, particularly in light of [Michael] 
Flannery's role as an open and active union adherent, that the 
[crumbs] warning ... was linked to [Flannery's] involvement 
with [the] Union."  Id.  That statement also supports the 
ALJ's determination that the message to Martin was that 
"involvement with the Union could lead to unspecified repri-
sals being taken against him" as well.  Id.

     The final management threat came on April 11, 1996, when, 
according to Michael Flannery's testimony, Kenney told him:  
"[I] don't believe you.  After what happened to your wife, 
you're still pushing the union and calling OSHA.  Are you 
going to make me fire you?"  Tr. at 127.  The ALJ credited 
Flannery's testimony as "honest and straightforward," and, 
with the exception of the reference to OSHA, Kenney did not 
controvert it.  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 13.  Accordingly, 
we have no doubt that the Board's finding--that Kenney 
threatened Michael Flannery in violation of section 8(a)(1)--is 
supported by substantial evidence.

                                B

     We next consider TBC's challenge to the Board's determi-
nations that the company violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) by 
taking disciplinary action against employees Michael Flan-
nery and Robert Nolan.  It is well settled that an employer 
violates the NLRA by taking an adverse employment action, 
such as issuing a disciplinary warning, in order to discourage 
union activity.  See Gold Coast Rest. Corp., 995 F.2d at 264-
65.  The central question is the employer's motivation for 
taking the adverse action, and to make that determination the 
NLRB employs the so-called Wright Line test.  See Wright 

Line, 251 N.L.R.B. 1083, 1089 (1980), enforced, 662 F.2d 899 
(1st Cir. 1981);  see also NLRB v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp., 462 
U.S. 393, 401-03 (1983) (approving Wright Line test);  TIC-
The Indus. Co. Southeast v. NLRB, 126 F.3d 334, 337 (D.C. 
Cir. 1997) ("TIC") (citing Wright Line).  Under that test, the 
General Counsel must first "make a prima facie showing 
sufficient to support the inference that protected [i.e., union-
related] conduct was a motivating factor in the ... adverse 
action."  TIC, 126 F.3d at 337 (citations and internal quota-
tions omitted).  In determining whether the employer had a 
discriminatory motive, "the NLRB may 'consider[ ] such fac-
tors as the employer's knowledge of the employee's union 
activities, the employer's hostility toward the union, and the 
timing of the employer's action.' "  Vincent Indus. Plastics, 
Inc. v. NLRB, 209 F.3d 727, 735 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting 
Power Inc. v. NLRB, 40 F.3d 409, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).  
Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden 
shifts to the company to show that it would have taken the 
same action in the absence of the unlawful motive.  TIC, 126 
F.3d at 337.

     The first adverse action at issue is the January 12, 1996 
written warning to Michael Flannery for allegedly failing to 
empty the crumbs from the crumbs depositor.  As the ALJ 
concluded, the General Counsel had a strong prima facie case 
that the warning was motivated by Flannery's union activi-
ties, given his well-known status as a union activist and the 
extensive evidence of anti-union animus provided by Kenney's 
and Britsch's threats, as well as by Britsch's statements to 
Edwina Flannery.  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 15.  The 
company, by contrast, was unable to demonstrate that it 
would have issued the warning absent this motivation.  The 
company conceded that no other employee had "ever been 
issued a disciplinary warning for failing to clean out a deposi-
tor."  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 9;  see Tr. at 325.  There 
was also substantial evidence that it was not Flannery's 
responsibility to empty the crumbs, including the testimony of 
both Flannery and Martin, as well as documentation showing 
that it was the function of the depositor operator, not Flan-
nery (the oven man), to remove the crumbs from the deposi-

tor.  Tr. at 169-70, 221;  Gen. Counsel Ex. 14 (J.A. 912-13);  
see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 15.  Finally, the coup de 
grace was Kenney's statement to Martin that he did not care 
whose job it was to remove the crumbs, and that he had 
issued the warning merely to "f**k Mike back."  As the ALJ 
said, this comment "provides near irrefutable evidence that 
the warning had nothing to do with crumbs being left in the 
depositor."  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 15-16.

     The second adverse action is the February 5, 1996 warning 
and suspension of Nolan for alleged insubordination.  A 
replacement floor monitor, Linda Casey, accused Nolan of 
using the telephone when not on break and of failing to go 
back to work when asked to do so.  The ALJ found a prima 
facie case of unlawful discrimination, both because Nolan was 
an open and active union adherent whose union sympathies 
were well known to TBC, and because there was substantial 
evidence of the company's anti-union animus, much of which 
has been described above.  As the ALJ correctly determined, 
whether TBC could rebut that case depended upon whose 
account of the phone incident was believed.  Id. at 17.  Ac-
cording to Nolan:  he had permission from his regular moni-
tor to take a break at the time he was making the call;  when 
Casey saw him, she immediately began screaming at him;  
and when he asked to see his regular monitor, Casey told him 
to get back to work, which he quickly did.  Tr. at 264-82;  see 
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 17.  Casey's version was that:  
she had caught Nolan making a call when he was not on 
break;  she directed him to return to work in a normal tone of 
voice;  and Nolan refused.  Tr. at 290-91;  see Tasty Baking 
Co., slip op. at 17.  The ALJ found Nolan to have testified in 
an "honest and truthful manner," while characterizing Casey's 
demeanor as that of "someone who was willing to slant her 
testimony to help her employer's cause."  Tasty Baking Co., 
slip op. at 17-18.  The ALJ found further evidence that the 
insubordination claim was a pretext in the fact that neither 
Casey nor higher-level supervisors gave Nolan a chance to 
explain before imposing the warning and suspension, as was 
required by company policy.  Id. at 18.  In light of the 
deference we owe to an ALJ's credibility determinations, we 

affirm the NLRB's finding with respect to this incident.  See 
Gold Coast Rest. Corp., 995 F.2d at 265;  see also Elastic Stop 
Nut Div. of Harvard Indus., Inc. v. NLRB, 921 F.2d 1275, 
1281 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that a reviewing court "must 
uphold Board-approved credibility determinations of an ALJ 
unless they are 'hopelessly incredible' or 'self-contradictory' " 
(citations omitted)).

     The final adverse action we consider in this section is the 
company's June 6, 1996 written warning to Michael Flannery 
for allegedly giving wrong oven times to other employees.  
Flannery testified that his supervisor originally told him he 
would receive only a memo to his file, and that when a 
performance warning issued instead, the supervisor told him 
that "the powers that be" had decided a warning was justified 
because production time had been lost.  Tr. at 131;  see Tasty 
Baking Co., slip op. at 10.  We agree with the Board's 
conclusion that the company's repeated statements and 
threats regarding Flannery provide substantial evidence for a 
prima facie case of anti-union animus, and we further con-
clude that substantial evidence supports the Board's determi-
nation that the company failed to show it would have disci-
plined Flannery had he not engaged in union activity.  See 
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 16-17.  The evidence showed 
that Flannery was given the oven times by someone else--
either a supervisor or fellow employee--and that the compa-
ny never inquired as to whether the times that person gave 
Flannery were wrong from the outset.  Id. at 10-11.  This is 
particularly significant because the person most likely to have 
given Flannery the oven times had furnished wrong times to 
the baking department just one month earlier.  Tr. at 392;  
see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 17.  Moreover, although the 
company claimed it issued Flannery a warning because the 
error had resulted in a loss of production, TBC had no 
evidence that it actually experienced any such loss.  Tasty 
Baking Co., slip op. at 17.

                                C

     We now consider TBC's challenge to the Board's conclu-
sions that the company violated the NLRA by demoting 

Edwina Flannery from her supervisory position, and by sub-
sequently transferring her to the night shift, in retaliation for 
her husband's union activities.

                                1

     The Board concluded that in June 1995, TBC violated 
section 8(a)(1) by demoting Edwina Flannery from supervisor 
to packer because of anti-union animus toward her husband, 
Michael Flannery.  As a matter of law, the Board appropri-
ately concluded that section 8(a)(1) prohibits a company from 
terminating or demoting a supervisor because of a family 
member's union activities.  Id. at 19-20.  This court has 
recognized the general principle that, although supervisors 
are not themselves protected by the NLRA, an action taken 
against a supervisor "is unlawful when it interferes with the 
right of employees to exercise their rights."  Parker-Robb 
Chevrolet, Inc., 262 N.L.R.B. 402, 404 (1982), aff'd sub nom. 
Auto. Salesmen's Union Local 1095 v. NLRB, 711 F.2d 383 
(D.C. Cir. 1983);  see Pioneer Hotel, Inc., 182 F.3d at 942 
(holding that an employer violates section 8(a)(1) when it 
discharges a supervisor for refusing to commit an unfair labor 
practice).  And courts have approved as well the Board's 
more specific conclusion that section 8(a)(1) is violated when 
an employer takes action against a supervisor in retaliation 
for a relative's union activities.  See Kenrich Petrochem., Inc. 
v. NLRB, 893 F.2d 1468, 1477-78 (3d Cir. 1990) ("Kenrich I"), 
vacated on other grounds by 907 F.2d 400, 402 (3d Cir. 1990) 
(en banc) ("Kenrich II");  NLRB v. Advertisers Mfg. Co., 823 
F.2d 1086, 1088-89 (7th Cir. 1987).  As Judge Posner has 
explained, to "retaliate against a man by hurting a member of 
his family is an ancient method of revenge," and retaliation 
aimed at a relative who is a supervisor can have "only one 
purpose, and that [is] to intimidate union supporters--consist-
ing mainly of workers protected by the Act ...--by showing 
the lengths to which the company would go to punish one of 
them."  Advertisers Mfg. Co., 823 F.2d at 1088.

     To determine whether TBC violated section 8(a)(1) in this 
manner, the Board properly applied the Wright Line test.  

See Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 20.  Substantial evidence for 
the prima facie case included the unlawful threats and warn-
ings issued directly to Michael Flannery--in particular, Ken-
ney's statement to Michael Flannery that Kenney couldn't 
believe that "[a]fter what happened to your wife, you're still 
pushing the union."  Tr. at 127.  The Board also reasonably 
concluded that the company had failed to rebut this prima 
facie case by showing that Edwina Flannery would have been 
demoted absent discriminatory motivation.  The company 
argued that, as part of a reorganization, it had selected 
Flannery for demotion because, in Kenney's words, she 
"couldn't get [the job] done" and her department was the 
"poorest in the bakery."  Id. at 457-58;  see Tasty Baking 
Co., slip op. at 20.  The ALJ rejected this explanation for a 
host of reasons.4  First, the ALJ did not believe Kenney's 
testimony, noting that he was evasive and inconsistent in his 
responses and unable to recollect even the year in which 
employees allegedly made complaints about Flannery's work.  
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 20.  Second, the ALJ noted that 
TBC's written appraisals of Flannery's performance showed 
that she had consistently met or exceeded the company's 
expectations for her job as supervisor of the Krimpet depart-
ment;5  indeed, she had received a merit increase for her work 
in 1994.  See Gen. Counsel Ex. 13 (J.A. 905-08);  Tasty 
Baking Co., slip op. at 20-21.  Third, the ALJ pointed out 
that although Flannery was not the only supervisor with 
responsibility for her department's performance, the company 
offered no explanation as to why in that department she alone 
was singled out for demotion.  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 
21.  Finally, the ALJ credited Flannery's testimony that at

Cir. 1997) (holding that although evidence supported the company's 
position that the challenged promotions were part of a planned 
reorganization, substantial evidence also supported the Board's 
conclusion that the timing of the promotions was part of an unlawful 
effort to interfere with unionization).

the end of 1994, a company vice president had assured her 
that she was the company's "newest rising star."  Tr. at 185;  
see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 21.

     Following the recitation of these reasons for rejecting the 
company's Wright Line rebuttal, the ALJ cited two other 
factors that give us some pause.  First, the ALJ noted that 
the company had not produced Edwina Flannery's 1995 per-
formance evaluation.  He concluded that such an evaluation 
must have existed and must have been favorable (as the 1994 
evaluation had been), else the company would have submitted 
it into evidence.  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 21.  This 
conclusion is questionable, as Flannery's 1995 demotion and 
transfer may have rendered the preparation of her 1995 
evaluation moot.  Second, the ALJ stated that he was uncon-
vinced that a reorganization had actually taken place, because 
no documents dated prior to Edwina Flannery's demotion 
referred to such a reorganization.  Id. at 22.  This conclusion 
seems weak as well, because reorganizations need not be 
preceded by documents and because TBC did produce other 
documents, roughly contemporaneous with Flannery's demo-
tion, that used the word "restructure" in connection with her 
demotion.  TBC Exs. 20-23 (J.A. 1066-69).

     Notwithstanding the weakness of these last two elements of 
the Board's reasoning, we will not remand an administrative 
adjudication where we have no "substantial doubt that the 
administrative agency would have reached the result it did 
absent reference" to the questionable factors.  Barnes v. 
Small, 840 F.2d 972, 979 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citations 
omitted);  see Puerto Rico Mar. Shipping Auth. v. Fed. Mar. 
Comm'n, 678 F.2d 327, 344 (D.C. Cir. 1982) ("The essential 
question on judicial review [is] whether the agency would 
have come to the same conclusion had it been aware of its 
error.").  We have no such doubt here, both because of the 
strength of the other record evidence, and because the ALJ 
expressly relied on that other evidence to reject TBC's 
Wright Line defense before he even considered the two 
further factors that we found to be questionable.  See Tasty 
Baking Co., slip op. at 21-22.

                                2

     More readily disposed of is TBC's challenge to the Board's 
conclusion that, soon after demoting Edwina Flannery from 
her supervisory position, the company again violated the 
NLRA by transferring her to the night shift because of her 
husband's continued union activity.  By that time, of course, 
Edwina Flannery was a statutory "employee," and hence was 
herself protected by the NLRA.  See Advertisers Mfg. Co., 
823 F.2d at 1088.

     The Board's case against TBC could hardly have been 
stronger.  Edwina Flannery testified that on August 10, 1995, 
two months after her demotion, Superintendent Britsch told 
her that her husband's continued distribution of union litera-
ture outside the plant "was not helping [her] chances of 
staying on day work."  Tr. at 200;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip 
op. at 7.  According to Flannery, Britsch said that "upper 
management would interpret this as a slap in the face," 
because Michael Flannery was continuing his union activities 
notwithstanding that the company was being "so nice" to her 
by letting her remain on the day shift.  Tr. at 200.  If this 
continued, Britsch warned, she "could very seriously end up 
on night work as a result of this."  Id.  (emphasis added).  
Edwina Flannery responded that her husband was a "grown 
man," and that she could not tell him what to do.  Id.;  see 
Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 22.6  On September 13, 1996, 
Michael Flannery again distributed union literature outside 
TBC, and one week later the company transferred his wife to 
the night shift.  Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 22.

     In its defense, TBC explained that when Edwina Flannery 
was demoted from her supervisory position, she lost her 
seniority pursuant to established company policy.  That loss 
of seniority, TBC claimed, rendered Flannery eligible only for 
the night shift.  But the company was unable to produce any 
documentation that such a policy, applicable to Flannery's

sation, the ALJ declined to credit Britsch's effort to characterize it 
as nothing more than helpful advice from a "Dutch uncle."  Tasty

situation, existed.  Id. at 22-23.  And Britsch himself con-
ceded that, although he believed such a policy did exist, TBC 
had not consistently applied it to demoted supervisors.  Tr. at 
423-24;  see Tasty Baking Co., slip op. at 22-23.  In light of 
this evidence, the Board reasonably rejected the company's 
Wright Line defense, and concluded that TBC transferred 
Edwina Flannery to the night shift in retaliation for her 
husband's continued union activity.

                                V

     Finally, TBC alleges that the Board exceeded its remedial 
power by ordering the company to reinstate Edwina Flannery 
as a supervisor.  We disagree.  As a general matter, the 
Board enjoys "broad discretionary power ... to fashion rem-
edies that effectuate the policies of the Act," and "the Board's 
exercise of its discretion is subject to quite limited judicial 
review."  Petrochem Insulation, Inc. v. NLRB, 240 F.3d 26, 
34 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  see Kenrich II, 907 F.2d at 406.  Al-
though it might be "anomalous to force the company to 
reinstate a supervisor who was on the union's side," Advertis-
ers Mfg. Co., 823 F.2d at 1089, there is no evidence in the 
record that Edwina Flannery was herself a union supporter.  
Indeed, Flannery's only response to Britsch's denouncement 
of her husband's activity was that he was "a grown man," and 
that she could not tell him what to do.  Tr. at 200;  see Tasty 
Baking Co., slip op. at 22.  Hence, in Judge Posner's colorful 
turn of phrase, "[t]he company is not being asked to grasp a 
viper to its bosom."  Advertisers Mfg. Co., 823 F.2d at 1089.  
Edwina Flannery "is not being reinstated so that she can help 
the union but so that [her husband] and other protected 
employees will not be deterred from exercising their rights 
... by fear that if they do the company will try to get back at 
them in any way it can, including by firing their relatives."  
Id.  Under these circumstances, reinstatement is an appro-
priate exercise of the Board's remedial authority.  Id.7
