       Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge 
Williams.

     Williams, Senior Circuit Judge.  Amoco Production Com-
pany and its affiliate BP Energy Company (collectively, 
"Amoco") appeal from four orders of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.  We initially address the first three 
orders, all revolving around the Commission's approval of a 
rate settlement;  we uphold the Commission.  Then we ad-
dress the fourth order, which turns out to be non-final and 
thus beyond our jurisdiction.

                              * * *

     Amoco produces natural gas and ships some of it through 
pipelines operated by Wyoming Interstate Company.  Wyo-
ming Interstate filed for a rate increase in 1997 under s 4 of 
the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. s 717c, and the new rates 
went into effect subject to refund on December 1, 1997 
(Docket No. RP97-375, the "1997 case").  After some proce-
dural wrangling, the Commission issued an order approving a 
contested settlement between Wyoming Interstate and all 
parties except Amoco, which was severed so that it could 
litigate its interests independently.  Wyoming Interstate 
Company, 87 FERC p 61,339 (1999) ("June 1999 Order").1

     1  The parties have included in the Joint Appendix only type- 
script versions of the Commission orders under review, rather than 
the published versions.  As our opinions are more communicative to 
the bar if we cite pages in the published versions, the typescript 
copies are of little use to us.  We have in the past commended use 
of the published version (blown-up), see Union Electric Co. v. 

     The approved settlement provided different rates for each 
of two separate periods.  Id. at 62,305.  For Period I, ending 
December 31, 1998, the rates were the same as the settlement 
rates approved by the Commission for Wyoming Interstate in 
a prior case, Docket No. RP94-267 (the "1994 case")--rates 
lower than those in Wyoming Interstate's 1997 filing.  Id.  
The rates for Period II (running from January 1, 1999 until 
the effective date of Wyoming Interstate's next rate filing, 
discussed below) were even lower.  Id.

     Shortly after the approval of this contested settlement, 
Wyoming Interstate filed a new s 4 case, in which it sought 
new rates effective January 1, 2000 (Docket No. RP99-381, 
the "1999 case").  As a result, the period covered by the 1997 
filing and settlement was "locked-in," i.e., it could not run 
beyond a known date--here, the last day of 1999.

     The Commission saw this new filing as altering the context 
of the 1997 case.  Denying Amoco's petition for rehearing of 
the settlement approval, the Commission not only stuck to its 
approval of the settlement for shippers other than Amoco, but 
extended the settlement to cover Amoco itself.  Wyoming 
Interstate Company, Ltd., 89 FERC p 61,028 (1999) ("October 
1999 Order").  Its reasoning was that there was no way that 
Amoco could benefit from pursuit of its claims in the 1997 
case.  It addressed three imaginable types of benefit:  (1) For 
the locked-in period at issue, Amoco could not recover re-
funds under s 4 of the Natural Gas Act because under 
established law, the "floor" for a s 4 refund calculation would 
be the prior lawful rate, i.e., the 1994 settlement rates.  But 
the 1997 settlement rates already secured by others were in 
the case of Period I the same as the 1994 rates, and in the 
case of Period II even lower.  So Amoco had nothing to gain 
under s 4.  Id. at 61,087-88.

     (2) Nor could Amoco recover reparations in the 1997 case 
under s 5 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. s 717d.  Given the complexity 
of Amoco's main issue (whether customers should receive a 
credit for a nearly $8 million dollar "exit fee" paid to Wyo-

FERC, 890 F.2d 1193, 1194 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and counsel seem 
generally to have followed our hint.

ming Interstate by Columbia Gas Transmission), the Commis-
sion could not finish the necessary hearing before the end of 
the locked-in period.  As the Commission can award s 5 
reparations only prospectively from the date of a finding that 
rates are not just and reasonable, Amoco had nothing to gain 
under s 5.  Id. at 61,088.

     (3) Finally, the Commission reasoned, any finding in the 
1997 case could not help Amoco with regard to the 1999 case.  
Again, the "floor" for refund purposes there would be the 
prior lawful rate.  For purposes of the 1999 case, this would 
be the Period II settlement rates, and Amoco's maximum 
imaginable success in the 1997 case could not produce a prior 
lawful rate even that low;  apart from the settlement of the 
1997 case, there was no basis for any floor lower than the 
1994 settlement rates.  Id. at 61,088-89.

     Accordingly, the Commission terminated the hearing 
scheduled for the 1997 case and approved the settlement for 
all parties.  Id.  It subsequently denied rehearing.  Wyo-
ming Interstate Company, Ltd., 89 FERC p 61,303 (1999) 
("December 1999 Order").

                             *  *  *

     Amoco first attacks the Commission's June 1999 Order 
approving the 1997 settlement as to the parties other than 
itself.  Amoco argues that there was no "substantial evi-
dence" that the settlement rates were "just and reasonable."  
But this misstates the issue.  All the non-Amoco shippers 
agreed to the settlement.  As it was "uncontested" as to 
them, the only burden on the Commission was to find that it 
was "fair and reasonable."  United Municipal Distributors 
Group v. FERC, 732 F.2d 202, 207 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  See 
June 1999 Order, 87 FERC p 61,339 at 62,308.  The Commis-
sion clearly recognized the distinction, and that is why it 
initially did not force the settlement on Amoco.  Id. at 
62,309-10.  Amoco does not even try to argue that there was 
not substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding 
that the settlement met the less stringent "fair and reason-
able" standard.

     Amoco's next claim is that the Commission's October and 
December 1999 Orders erred in concluding that, after Wyo-
ming Interstate's 1999 filing, Amoco had nothing to gain from 
pursuit of its claims in the 1997 case.  Specifically it attacks 
the third element in the October 1999 Order--the conclusion 
that a s 5 finding that the "just and reasonable" rates were 
below even the 1997 Period II settlement rates could not 
benefit Amoco in the 1999 case.  Amoco asserts that there is 
a potential benefit:  Such a lower rate, it claims, could become 
the "floor" for s 4 refunds in the 1999 case.

     Amoco's argument fatally confronts the text of s 4(e) of the 
Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. s 717c.  That section provides 
that in the period after a gas carrier has filed new rates, and 
the same have been suspended and put in effect subject to 
refund, the Commission may require the carrier "to keep 
accurate accounts in detail of all amounts received by reason 
of such increase," and that the Commission may order re-
funds of "the portion of such increased rates or charges by its 
decision found not justified."  s 4(e), 15 U.S.C. s 717c(e) 
(emphasis added).  It was this text that led the Supreme 
Court in Federal Power Commission v. Sunray DX Oil Co., 
391 U.S. 9 (1968), to hold that the refund obligation extends 
only to rate increases found improper.  There the Court dealt 
with whether the Commission could order refunds by carriers 
that had been charging rates in accordance with a certificate 
of convenience and necessity under s 7 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 
s 717f, in the absence of a condition in the certificate allowing 
such a refund.  The Court looked to s 4, and found that any 
ambiguity in the refund provision itself ("the portion of such 
increased rates or charges by its decision found not justified") 
was resolved by the accounting provision, which was limited 
to "amounts received by reason of such increase."  Id. at 24 
(internal quotes omitted).  "If it had been intended that the 
refund obligation should extend to greater amounts, the 
accounting requirement logically should have extended to 
them also."  Id.  The Court went on to point out an anomaly 
that any other interpretation would create:

     It would be anomalous to treat an increased price as a 
     trigger for a refund obligation which would leave the 
     producer with a smaller net return than if it had never 
     increased its price at all.
     
Id.

     In Distrigas of Massachusetts Corp. v. FERC, 737 F.2d 
1208 (1st Cir. 1984), the First Circuit applied Sunray under 
conditions virtually identical to ours.  Distrigas had been 
charging a FERC-approved settlement rate, and then filed a 
rate increase to take effect July 1979.  Id. at 1222.  Adjudi-
cating that filing, the Commission found that the "just and 
reasonable" rates were lower than the settlement rate, but 
refused to order refunds based on a benchmark lower than 
the pre-July 1979 rate.  Id. at 1224.  The court upheld the 
Commission.  Then-judge Breyer wrote for the court that 
under Sunray, FERC could order refunds only for amounts 
exceeding "the pre-existing lawful rate," there the settlement 
rates in effect prior to the 1979 filing.  Id.  Judge Breyer 
observed that the Court had derived this conclusion "from the 
language of the statute and from the fact that, otherwise, a 
firm asking for an increase could end up considerably worse 
off than if it had not requested one."  Id.

     Distrigas applies here.  For the 1999 case, the "floor" 
cannot be lower than the Period II settlement rates.  Con-
ceivably Amoco might object that, in distinction to Distrigas, 
the settlement rates governing the 1997-99 locked-in period 
were neither uniformly agreed to nor found to pass the 
relatively demanding standards for a contested settlement.  
But if the 1997-99 settlement rates are removed from the 
picture, the language of s 4 would drive the Commission back 
to the 1994 rates--which are higher than the Period II 
settlement rate.  Thus any refund "floor" lower than the 
Period II settlement rate would--in the face of Sunray and 
Distrigas--leave Wyoming Interstate "considerably worse off 
than if it had not" made the 1997 or the 1999 filings.

     Amoco also claims that the Commission failed to abide by 
two of its own precedents--Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line 
Co., 77 FERC p 61,284 (1996), and Southern Natural Gas Co., 

65 FERC p 61,347, at 62,827 (1993).  Amoco is mistaken.  In 
those cases the Commission simply recognized that when a 
carrier files first one s 4 rate increase and then another, the 
rate found "just and reasonable" in the first case may become 
the "floor" in the second.  Nothing in either case addressed 
the situation presented here.

     We affirm the Commission's orders approving the settle-
ment for all shippers, including Amoco.

                             *  *  *

     In response to motions for clarification of the December 
1999 Order approving the settlement, the Commission set 
some ground rules for litigation of the 1999 case.  Specifical-
ly, it ruled that under the settlement all shippers other than 
Amoco were bound in the 1999 case by the settlement's 
resolution of the Columbia exit fee issue discussed above.  
Wyoming Interstate Company, Ltd., 90 FERC p 61,294 (2000) 
("March 2000 Order").

     Amoco sought rehearing, arguing that it should be able, if 
it prevailed in its position on the Columbia exit fee, to have 
that ruling applied to the rates charged other shippers, 
regardless of their position on the issue.  Its reasoning was 
that those rates severely impacted the price Amoco could 
obtain at the wellhead.  (Thus, for example, it could not 
normally receive more at the wellhead than the market value 
in the destination market, less transportation costs.)  Amoco 
saw itself in a position parallel to that of buyers at the end of 
FERC-regulated electricity transmission systems, which un-
der certain circumstances we had held were entitled to chal-
lenge rates agreed to by the relevant transmission companies 
and all the shippers.  Southern California Edison Co. v. 
FERC, 162 F.3d 116 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  Tejas Power Corp. v. 
FERC, 908 F.2d 998 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  Compare FERC Brief, 
filed Oct. 9, 2001, in Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America v. FERC, D.C. Cir. No. 98-1333, at 48 n.12 (observ-
ing that "lower prices for transportation under maximum rate 
regulation translates to a greater share of the delivered price 
of gas being retained by the producers").

     In two orders issued September 27, 2000, the Commission 
rejected Amoco's argument.  Wyoming Interstate Company, 
92 FERC p 61,256 (2000);  Wyoming Interstate Company, 92 
FERC p 61,257 (2000) ("September 2000 Order").  The first 
is an order approving the non-Amoco shippers' settlement of 
the 1999 case, and the second is an order addressed to 
Amoco's litigation of the 1999 case and denying Amoco's 
petition for rehearing of the March 2000 Order.  Amoco seeks 
review only of the second.

     We have no jurisdiction over the September 2000 Order.  
Although s 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. s 717r(b), 
affords authority to review an "order" of the Commission, this 
has long been understood to encompass only "final" orders.  
See, e.g., Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers v. 
FERC, 254 F.3d 289, 296 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  Papago Tribal 
Utility Authority v. FERC, 628 F.2d 235, 238-40 (D.C. Cir. 
1980) (construing the substantively identical text of the Fed-
eral Power Act, 16 U.S.C. s 825l(b), as requiring a final 
order);  United Municipal Distributors Group, 732 F.2d at 
206 n.3 (holding that the Papago analysis is applicable to the 
Natural Gas Act).  The Commission's position on the indirect-
interests issue can affect only the 1999 case, which the 
Commission has yet to adjudicate.
