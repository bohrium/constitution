     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Michelle Elzie1 and the District of 
Columbia Board of Parole (collectively "the Board") appeal 
the order granting, in part, Edward Maddox's petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus.  The Board contends as a threshold 
matter that the district court erred in not requiring Maddox 
to exhaust his habeas corpus remedies in the District of 
Columbia courts before allowing him to challenge, under 28 
U.S.C. s 2241 (1994), his service of a sentence imposed by the 
Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  On the merits, 
the Board contends that the district court erred in partially 
granting the writ because Maddox failed to show that the 
manner in which the Board conducted his parole revocation 
hearing resulted in any prejudicial violation of his due process 
rights.  We reverse the district court's order on the merits 
without deciding the exhaustion issue.

                                I.

     The United States Attorney prosecuted Maddox three 
times in the United States district court in connection with 
his April 9, 1996, arrest.  The first trial resulted in a mistrial;  
Maddox was convicted at the second trial, but his conviction 
was reversed because of prosecutorial misconduct during 
closing argument, see United States v. Maddox, 156 F.3d 
1280 (D.C. Cir. 1998) ("Maddox I");  the jury found him not 
guilty at the third trial.2  After the reversal of Maddox's

     1  Appellant Michelle Elzie is the warden of the District of 
Columbia's Central Detention Facility.

     2  The charges stemmed from Maddox's arrest on April 9, 1996, 
when a police officer, after retrieving a rental car key that Maddox 

second conviction, the Board lodged a parole violation war-
rant for Maddox's prior D.C. Superior Court sentence;  Mad-
dox therefore remained in custody following his acquittal.3  
The Board thereafter revoked his parole, and Maddox filed a 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. s 2241 
(1994).4  In seeking reinstatement of his parole, Maddox 
argued that the trial prosecutor's appearance at the revoca-
tion hearing was in retaliation for Maddox's exercise of his 
statutory right to appeal and his constitutional right to a jury 
trial, and thus violated his right to due process.  Under the 
circumstances, he argued that the court must presume vindic-
tiveness, and alternatively, that there was actual vindictive-
ness.  See Maddox v. Elzie, 83 F. Supp. 2d 113, 120 (D.D.C. 
1999) ("Maddox II").  In addition, he argued that the trial 

__________
had dropped upon seeing the police approach him, found a handgun 
and PCP under the driver's seat of the rental car.  See Maddox v. 
Elzie, 83 F. Supp. 2d 113, 115 (D.D.C. 1999) ("Maddox II").  The 
grand jury returned a four-count indictment;  one count was dis-
missed.  At his first trial, Maddox was tried for one count of 
possession of PCP with intent to distribute, see 21 U.S.C. 
ss 841(a)(1) (1994), 841(b)(1)(D) (Supp. IV 1998), and one count of 
carrying and using a firearm during a drug trafficking offense.  See 
18 U.S.C. s 924(c)(1) (Supp. IV 1998). At his second trial, Maddox 
was tried for one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted 
felon, see id. s 922(g)(1).  This count had been severed from the 
other counts against Maddox prior to his first trial.  At his third 
trial, Maddox was retried on the single count of possession of a 
firearm by a convicted felon.

     3  In 1981, Maddox was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment by 
the D.C. Superior Court for armed robbery, assault with intent to 
commit robbery while armed, and carrying a dangerous weapon.  
He was paroled in November 1991 and released on January 27, 
1992.

     4  Section 2241 provides, in relevant part:

     The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless 
     ... [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or 
     treaties of the United States ...
     
28 U.S.C. s 2241(c)(3) (1994).

prosecutor's ex parte meeting with the Board violated his due 
process rights to confront and to cross-examine witnesses.

     Following a hearing, the district court granted the writ in 
part.  The district court found that Maddox had been denied 
his constitutional rights to due process, specifically his right 
to confront adverse witnesses and his right to be present at 
every stage of the revocation proceeding.  See id. at 121.  In 
addition, because the trial prosecutor appeared not only as a 
witness, but presented evidence and argument and cross-
examined witnesses, the district court ruled that inasmuch as 
the trial prosecutor had no legal right to participate in the 
revocation hearing, his "excessive" conduct constituted actual 
prosecutorial vindictiveness.  Id. at 121-23.  The district 
court ordered that a new revocation hearing be held in 
accordance with certain conditions, and continued Maddox's 
detention while retaining jurisdiction of the case.5  Id. at 124-
25.  The Board's motion to alter or amend the judgment 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) was denied.6

     As a threshold matter, the Board contends that the district 
court should have required Maddox to exhaust his habeas 

__________
     5  The district court ordered (1) that the record of the first 
hearing be expunged;  (2) that the new hearing be recorded, take 
place before a new Board, and involve no ex parte contacts;  and (3) 
that Maddox be given credit against his D.C. sentence for the time 
he was incarcerated on the federal charges.  See Maddox II, 83 
F. Supp. 2d at 122-24.  Prior to oral argument of this appeal, the 
District of Columbia Department of Corrections credited Maddox 
with time he was incarcerated prior to trial on the federal charges.  
See October 3, 2000 Letter to Mark J. Langer, Clerk of the Court, 
provided pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j).

     6  A successor district court assigned to handle the case upon 
the retirement of the habeas judge denied the motion on the ground 
that it was "an invitation for one district judge to hear an appeal 
from another."  In view of our disposition, we do not reach the 
Board's contention that, under Langevine v. District of Columbia, 
106 F.3d 1018 (D.C. Cir. 1997), the denial was an abuse of discre-
tion.

corpus remedies in the District of Columbia courts because he 
was challenging his reincarceration on a sentence imposed by 
the D.C. Superior Court.  Although the Board acknowledged 
that under Blair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d 1036 (D.C. Cir. 1998), 
a D.C. prisoner may challenge his parole revocation in federal 
court by means of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. s 2241 
(1994), the Board maintains that a D.C. prisoner, "like any 
other state prisoner," must first exhaust his local habeas 
corpus remedies in the District of Columbia courts.  See, e.g., 
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 731 (1991) (and cases 
cited).  The Board relies for its exhaustion argument on the 
long-established principle that federal courts should not inter-
fere with a State conviction or with the service of a State 
sentence until the State courts address any errors.

     We are not unsympathetic to the Board's view that requir-
ing a D.C. prisoner to exhaust his habeas remedies under 
District of Columbia law before filing a petition under 28 
U.S.C. s 2241 follows logically from the establishment of a 
State-type court system for the District of Columbia.  See 
District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure 
Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970) ("Court 
Reform Act").  After the expansion of the federal courts' 
habeas corpus jurisdiction to include cases in which State 
prisoners are held in violation of the United States Constitu-
tion, the Supreme Court recognized that federal courts had 
the power to grant relief to State prisoners and that, as a 
consequence, there was a potential for conflict between feder-
al and State courts.  See Irvin v. Dowd, 359 U.S. 394, 404-05 
(1959).  The potential for such conflict necessitated, in the 
Court's view, exhaustion of State remedies before the federal 
courts intervened.  The Court explained:

     [t]he principles are now reasonably clear.  Ordinarily an 
     application for habeas corpus by one detained under a 
     state court judgment of conviction for crime will be 
     entertained by a federal court only after all state reme-
     dies available, including all appellate remedies in the 
     state court and in [the Supreme] Court by appeal or writ 
     of certiorari have been exhausted.
     
Id. at 405 (quoting Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 116-17 
(1944)).7 Congress codified the exhaustion doctrine in 28 
U.S.C. s 2254 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998).8  See Irvin, 359 U.S. 
at 405.

     The Board contends that for the reasons noted in Irvin v. 
Dowd the exhaustion doctrine embodied in s 2254 should 
apply to D.C. prisoners.  To overcome the fact that the 
District of Columbia is not a State, the Board points out that 
s 2254 was enacted before the District of Columbia had an 
independent court system equivalent to a State system and at 
a time when most criminal prosecutions for violation of Dis-
trict of Columbia law had to be filed in the federal courts.  
See Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 392 n.2, 408-09 
(1973);  Thompson v. United States, 548 F.2d 1031, 1033-34 
(D.C. Cir. 1976).  Once Congress established a separate 
State-type court system for the District of Columbia with its 
own habeas corpus remedies, see D.C. Code ss 16-1901, 

__________
     7  The Supreme Court allowed an exception "in cases of peculiar 
urgency," Tinsley v. Anderson, 171 U.S. 101, 105 (1898), such as 
when the petitioner is needed to testify in federal court;  or is in 
State custody for an act done or omitted pursuant to federal law;  or 
is a foreign national in State custody for an act done or omitted 
pursuant to the authority of the foreign state and, therefore, 
international law and the federal government's unique interest in 
foreign relations are implicated. See Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 
251-52 (1886).

     8  Section 2254 provides, in relevant part:

     An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person 
     in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not 
     be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted 
     the remedies available in the courts of the State;  or there is an 
     absence of available corrective process;  or circumstances exist 
     that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the 
     applicant....  An applicant shall not be deemed to have 
     exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, 
     within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the 
     law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the 
     question presented.
     
28 U.S.C. s 2254(b)(1), (c) (Supp. IV 1998).

23-110 (1981),9 the Board maintains there is no reason not to 
treat D.C. prisoners like State prisoners and require D.C. 
prisoners to exhaust their District of Columbia law remedies.  
Maddox responds that, in view of the statement by the court 
in Blair-Bey, 151 F.3d at 1044, that District of Columbia and 
federal remedies are equally available to D.C. prisoners, he 
was not required to exhaust his remedies under District of 
Columbia law before filing a petition under s 2241.

     The court was not confronted in Blair-Bey with an exhaus-
tion issue because the defendant in that case had, in fact, 
exhausted his remedies under District of Columbia law.  See 
id. at 1038.  Consequently, the court had no occasion to 
address the exhaustion contention that the Board now pres-

     A person committed, detained, confined, or restrained from his 
     lawful liberty within the District [of Columbia] ... may apply 
     by petition to the appropriate court, or a judge thereof, for a 
     writ of habeas corpus, to the end that the cause of the 
     commitment, detainer, confinement, or restraint may be in-
     quired into.
     
D.C. Code s 16-1901(a) (1981).

Section 23-110 provides, in relevant part:

     A prisoner in custody under sentence of the Superior Court [of 
     the District of Columbia] claiming the right to be released upon 
     the ground that (1) the sentence was imposed in violation of the 
     Constitution of the United States or the laws of the District of 
     Columbia, (2) the court was without jurisdiction to impose the 
     sentence, (3) the sentence was in excess of the maximum 
     authorized by law, (4) the sentence is otherwise subject to 
     collateral attack, may move the court to vacate, set aside, or 
     correct the sentence....  An application for a writ of habeas 
     corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for 
     relief by motion pursuant to this section shall not be enter-
     tained by the Superior Court or by any Federal or State court 
     if it appears that the applicant has failed to make a motion for 
     relief under this section or that the Superior Court has denied 
     him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is 
     inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.

ents.  Congress did not specifically address the question in 
the Court Reform Act, and the question whether a D.C. 
prisoner should be treated as a State prisoner for purposes of 
s 2254 is an open question in this circuit.  The court has 
addressed the question of whether the District of Columbia is 
to be treated as a State in connection with a s 2241 habeas 
petition attacking a D.C. conviction and sentence.  In Garris 
v. Lindsay, 794 F.2d 722 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the court applied 
the appeal requirements of 28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1) (Supp. IV 
1998)10 by treating a D.C. Superior Court conviction and 
sentence as "detention ... aris[ing] out of process issued by a 
State court."11  Id. at 724 (interpreting an earlier version of 
28 U.S.C. s 2253).  Whatever the logical import of Garris 
may be for purposes of the Board's exhaustion contention, the 
court need not resolve this question today because the district 
court erred in ruling that Maddox was denied due process at 
his parole revocation hearing.  Cf. Montez v. McKinna, 208 
F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir. 2000);  see also 28 U.S.C. 
s 2254(b)(2)(Supp. IV 1998).12

__________
     10  Section 2253(c)(1) provides:

     Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeala-
     bility, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from 
     the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the 
     detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State 
     court or the final order in a proceeding under [28 U.S.C. 
     s] 2255.
     
28 U.S.C. s 2253(c)(1) (Supp. IV 1998);  see also Fed. R. App. P. 
22(b).

     11  In Garris, the court concluded that the petitioner was not 
entitled to a certificate of appealability under s 2253 because he 
had not met the requirements of D.C. Code s 23-110(g) (1981), see 
supra n.9, and, therefore, the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over 
his petition.  See Garris, 794 F.2d at 727.  See also Swain v. 
Pressley, 430 U.S. 372 (1977).

     12  Section 2254(b)(2) provides:

          An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on 
     the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to 
     exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.
     
                                         III.

     The Board contends that the district court erred in grant-
ing Maddox partial habeas corpus relief on the ground that he 
was denied due process at his parole revocation hearing.  
Essentially, the Board maintains that Maddox failed to show 
any prejudicial constitutional error because his acquittal after 
trial did not preclude the Board from revoking parole, if 
appropriate, following a hearing.  Joined by the United 
States as amicus curiae, the Board maintains that a review of 
the revocation hearing, including the trial prosecutor's con-
duct, demonstrates that Maddox had a full and fair hearing 
under Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), that the trial 
prosecutor's participation did not amount to actual vindictive-
ness in violation of Maddox's constitutional rights, and that a 
presumption of vindictiveness is unwarranted.  We first ad-
dress the trial prosecutor's ex parte meeting with the Board 
and then turn to the trial prosecutor's conduct during the 
revocation hearing.

                                A.

     In Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), the Supreme 
Court set forth the oft-repeated minimal due process require-
ments to which a parolee is entitled when a state attempts to 
revoke parole.13  The Court cautioned in Morrissey, however, 

__________
28 U.S.C. s 2254(b)(2)(Supp. IV 1998).

     13  In Morrissey, the Court stated:

     There must also be an opportunity for a hearing, if it is desired 
     by the parolee, prior to the final decision on revocation by the 
     parole authority.  This hearing must be the basis for more than 
     determining probable cause;  it must lead to a final evaluation 
     of any contested relevant facts and consideration of whether 
     the facts as determined warrant revocation.  The parolee must 
     have an opportunity to be heard and to show, if he can, that he 
     did not violate the conditions [of parole], or, if he did, that 
     circumstances in mitigation suggest that the violation does not 
     warrant revocation....  [T]he minimum requirements of due 
     process [include] (a) written notice of the claimed violations of 
     parole;  (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him;  
     
that "there is no thought to equate this second stage of parole 
revocation to a criminal prosecution in any sense.  It is a 
narrow inquiry;  the process should be flexible enough to 
consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other mate-
rial that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal 
trial."  Id. at 489.  Similarly, in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 
778, 789 (1973), the Supreme Court explained that "[i]n a 
revocation hearing ... formal procedures and rules of evi-
dence are not employed."  The same due process standards 
apply to D.C. prisoners subject to parole revocation by the 
Board.  See Ellis v. District of Columbia, 84 F.3d 1413 (D.C. 
Cir. 1996);  Teachey v. Carver, 736 A.2d 998, 1006 n.9 (D.C. 
1999).

     Prior to the parole revocation hearing, the Board held an 
off-the-record meeting with the trial prosecutor, for approxi-
mately five to twelve minutes.  The Board also held a similar 
meeting with Maddox's counsel for approximately five min-
utes.  According to Maddox's counsel, who testified during 
the habeas proceeding, the Board described its procedures 
and inquired about counsel's theory of the case, which counsel 
outlined.  See Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  Counsel 
assumed that the same thing occurred during the trial prose-
cutor's ex parte meeting with the Board.  See id.  The trial 
prosecutor testified that he did not recall the substance of the 
ex parte meeting, but he also did not deny the possibility that 
he reviewed the merits of the federal case against Maddox.  
See id. Based on the prosecutor's ex parte meeting with the 
Board prior to the hearing, the district court ruled that 

__________
     (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses 
     and documentary evidence;  (d) the right to confront and cross-
     examine witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds 
     good cause for not allowing confrontation);  (e) a neutral and 
     detached hearing body such as a traditional parole board, 
     members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers;  and 
     (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence 
     relied on and reasons for revoking parole.
     
408 U.S. at 487-89 (quotations omitted).

Maddox's right to confront witnesses and his right to be 
present had been violated.  See id. at 121.

     The United States concedes that ex parte contacts create 
the appearance of impropriety and that such contacts should 
be avoided.  See Amicus Brief at 28 n.17.  The Board, in 
apparent agreement, does not challenge the district court's 
conclusion that the ex parte meeting with the trial prosecutor 
was inappropriate.  We agree with these views, for ex parte 
meetings can create problems that exceed their value.  The 
Supreme Court has observed that an ex parte meeting be-
tween a trial judge and a juror creates a situation "pregnant 
with possibilities for error."  United States v. United States 
Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 460 (1978).  The same might be 
said of the Board's meeting with the trial prosecutor.

     Nevertheless, the fact that an ex parte meeting occurs does 
not necessarily entitle a defendant to relief.  See Rushen v. 
Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 117-19 (1983).  For example, in United 
States v. Green, 544 F.2d 138, 146 (3rd Cir. 1976), the Third 
Circuit held that a judge's ex parte contacts with a court-
appointed expert did not violate a criminal defendant's due 
process rights because the ex parte contacts were not "clan-
destine" and defense counsel was afforded an opportunity to 
present countervailing evidence and to cross-examine the 
expert regarding the ex parte contacts.  Id.  Likewise, in 
United States v. McDonald, 933 F.2d 1519 (10th Cir. 1991), 
the Tenth Circuit found no plain error where an ex parte 
communication occurred between a trial judge and a juror, 
because defense counsel was made aware of the ex parte 
communication, yet declined either to pursue the matter or to 
object to the communication, thus indicating that "counsel felt 
no prejudice existed at the time."  Id. at 1525.  So too here.  
Maddox fails to show that he was prejudiced in the exercise 
of his rights to confront witnesses and to be present as a 
result of the Board's ex parte meeting with the trial prosecu-
tor prior to commencement of the revocation hearing.  See 
Sutherland v. McCall, 709 F.2d 730, 732-33 (D.C. Cir. 1983);  
Standlee v. Rhay, 557 F.2d 1303, 1307-08 (9th Cir. 1977);  cf. 
Harris v. Day, 649 F.2d 755, 761-62 (10th Cir. 1981).

     First, the record belies any contention that Maddox did not 
have an opportunity to present his full case to the Board in 
support of his claim of innocence.  The Board heard testimo-
ny from Maddox's wife that on April 9, 1996, she had loaned 
the rental car to her nephew (since deceased), who was 
involved with drugs and guns.  Her sister corroborated some 
of this testimony.  A friend of Maddox's testified that he had 
given Maddox a ride to the street where he was subsequently 
stopped and arrested by the police.  Maddox also proffered 
the trial testimony of two other defense witnesses.  Finally, 
Maddox, who had not testified at his trials, testified that on 
April 9th, 1996, he never touched the rental car after his wife 
returned it to him.  While acknowledging that he had rented 
a number of cars over several months, for about $4000, 
Maddox claimed that he had several jobs and had been 
working for over two years at Super Fresh.

     The Board found that Maddox had violated his parole in 
four of the six alleged violations, including PCP and gun 
possession.  In so doing, the Board had reasonable grounds 
to reject Maddox's defense.  His parole officer testified that 
from 1992 to 1996, Maddox had worked for only three weeks.  
Maddox then appeared to acknowledge that he had not 
worked at Super Fresh for two years, but for only a week 
between trials.  Maddox claimed that his wife, who had a 
government GS-5 job, and his brother, who owned his own 
business, helped him out financially.  While Maddox's counsel 
urged the Board not to revoke his parole in view of the 
weaknesses in the government's evidence regarding the 
events of April 9, 1996, unlike the juries in his federal trials, 
the Board could consider Maddox's credibility for itself.

     Maddox can hardly deny that the Board had sufficient 
evidence to justify revocation of his parole.  District of Co-
lumbia regulations do not limit the information that the Board 
may consider in determining whether to revoke parole.  See 
D.C. Mun. Reg. tit. 28 ss 219.1-219.12 (1987).  In addition to 
hearing from the trial prosecutor and one of the police 
officers who had been involved in Maddox's arrest on April 9, 
1996, the Board had other information about Maddox, includ-

ing evidence of his five arrests after he was paroled.  Nota-
bly, the Board had already given him a second chance by 
allowing him to remain on parole after arrests in 1992 and 
1993.

     Second, Maddox was represented by a Federal Public 
Defender at the revocation hearing.  His counsel was aware 
of the Board's ex parte meeting with the trial prosecutor, yet 
counsel neither objected to it nor otherwise indicated to the 
Board that the revocation hearing was tainted.  To the 
contrary, counsel told the Board that he thought the Board 
would be fair in determining Maddox's fate.  Counsel also did 
not seek to have the trial prosecutor, or the Board, place on 
the record what had occurred during the ex parte meeting.  
Nor did counsel seek, during the habeas proceeding, discov-
ery regarding the ex parte meeting.14  On appeal, counsel has 
pointed to nothing that would indicate that the trial prosecu-
tor's ex parte meeting interfered with Maddox's ability to 
present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses or to be 
aware of the evidence on which the Board relied in revoking 
his parole.

     To the extent that the district court relied on Faretta v. 
California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), which involved a criminal 
defendant's Sixth Amendment rights during trial, in ruling 
that Maddox's due process rights were violated, that reliance 
was misplaced.  See Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 121.  
Morrissey makes clear that parole revocation is not the 
continuation of a criminal trial but a separate administrative 
proceeding at which the parolee does not possess the same 
rights as a criminal defendant at trial.  See Morrissey, 408 
U.S. at 480.  Conflating the distinct constitutional rights

     14  In its Response to the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, 
the Board took issue with Maddox's characterization of its "alleged 
closed door hearing for 30 to 45 minutes" with the trial prosecutor, 
stating that at each ex parte meeting,

     each side was asked to discuss whether certain facts could be 
     stipulated in order to shorten the hearing, which was expected 
     to be lengthy.  The only reason the door was closed was 
     because of disruption from the well-know[n] din of the jail 
     inmates just outside the door.
     
Counsel did not seek to depose the Board members.

associated with the different proceedings confuses the analy-
sis of Maddox's ex parte contention.  Unless the parolee 
requests a hearing, District of Columbia regulations provide 
that the Board may make its revocation determination with-
out a hearing.  See D.C. Mun. Reg. Tit. 28 s 219.2 (1987).  
The Board's ex parte meeting with the trial prosecutor before 
the Board commenced the hearing was not secret.  Cf. 
WKAT, Inc. v. FCC, 296 F.2d 375, 383 (D.C. Cir. 1961).  
Maddox's counsel had an opportunity to explore the nature of 
the meeting at the revocation hearing.  The fact that Mad-
dox, who was represented by counsel, did not take advantage 
of his opportunity to question the trial prosecutor about his ex 
parte meeting with the Board is not a basis for finding a 
denial of due process.

                                B.

     The district court found clear evidence of prosecutorial 
vindictiveness.  Specifically, the district court found that the 
trial prosecutor "was upset about losing his case, which he 
blame[d] on defense counsel's successful impeachment of gov-
ernment witnesses, and putting on a defense case," and that 
the trial prosecutor "took over the Parole Board's function 
and prosecuted Maddox a second time," obtaining "the 'con-
viction' and sentence he was denied at trial" under a lowered 
standard of proof and relaxed evidentiary standards.  Mad-
dox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 121. Viewing the trial prosecutor's 
conduct to have been "excessive," id. at 123, the district court 
noted that the trial prosecutor was not invited by the Board 
to appear as a witness.  See id. at 121.  Instead he "insinu-
ate[d] himself into the proceeding to see that Maddox would 
not be freed after his acquittal" and then "took over."  Id.  
In the district court's view, "[o]nce [the United States] takes 
on the role of prosecuting parole violation cases after a jury 
has acquitted the defendant, it opens itself up to the charge of 
vindictiveness."  Id. at 122.  The district court stated that 
although it had no intent to intrude on the manner in which 
the Board conducts its hearings, the court was concerned that 
"the [United States] cannot use the forum of a parole revoca-
tion hearing to retry a defendant as part of a vindictive action 

to jail someone the government believes to be a bad person 
particularly because that person has exercised his right to a 
jury trial."  Id.  Our review of the district court's factual 
finding of actual vindictiveness is for clear error, see United 
States v. Meyer, 810 F.2d 1242, 1244 (D.C. Cir. 1987), al-
though the threshold question of whether the doctrine applies 
in the parole revocation context is a question of law that we 
review de novo.  See United States v. Johnson, 91 F.3d 695, 
698 (5th Cir. 1996) (and cases cited).

     The doctrine of prosecutorial vindictiveness developed as a 
corollary to the vindictiveness doctrine that precludes, as a 
matter of due process, imposition by a judge of a more severe 
sentence upon retrial after a defendant has successfully exer-
cised a constitutional right or pursued a statutory right of 
appeal or collateral attack.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 
395 U.S. 711, 723-26 (1969).  In the prosecutorial context, the 
doctrine precludes action by a prosecutor that is designed to 
penalize a defendant for invoking any legally protected right 
available to a defendant during a criminal prosecution.  See 
Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 27-29 (1974);  United States 
v. Meyer, 810 F.2d 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1987);  United States v. 
Jamison, 505 F.2d 407 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  To prove actual 
vindictiveness requires "objective evidence" that the prosecu-
tor's actions were designed to punish a defendant for assert-
ing his legal rights.  See Meyer, 810 F.2d at 1245 (citing 
United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380-81, 384 & n.19 
(1982)).  Such a showing is normally "exceedingly difficult to 
make."  Id.  Because the underlying concern is not whether a 
prosecutor has acted maliciously or in bad faith, see Black-
ledge, 417 U.S. at 28, but whether "the fear of [prosecutorial] 
vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's ex-
ercise of [a constitutional or statutory right]," id. (quotation 
omitted), a presumption of vindictiveness may be warranted 
"in cases in which a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness 
exists," Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 373;  see also Alabama v. 
Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 799-800 (1989).  The government may 
overcome the presumption with "objective information in the 
record justifying the increased sentence [or charges]."  Good-
win, 457 U.S. at 374.  "If the government produces such 

evidence, the [criminal] defendant's only hope is to prove that 
the justification is pretextual and that actual vindictiveness 
has occurred."  Meyer, 810 F.2d at 1245.

     Amicus the United States contends that the district court 
had no basis for finding actual vindictiveness.  First, a trial 
prosecutor does not wield unilateral power over the decision 
to be made by an independent adjudicative body.  The Board, 
not the United States, is responsible for the revocation deci-
sion, and Maddox has never contended that the Board was 
simply the trial prosecutor's tool.  Cf. United States v. Liddy, 
542 F.2d 76, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1976).  Second, a parole board is 
not being asked at a revocation hearing " 'to do over what it 
thought it had already done correctly,' " Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 
383 (quoting Colten v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 407 U.S. 
104, 117 (1972)), but rather to make an entirely new decision 
based on an altered factual record.  There is nothing in the 
record indicating that the Board had a " 'personal stake' " in 
Maddox's earlier trials such that it might engage in " 'self-
vindication' " by revoking his parole.  Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 
383 (quoting Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 27 (1973)).  
Nor is there evidence of an institutional bias that would 
prompt the Board to treat a parolee who has been acquitted 
more severely than a parolee who has not been acquitted.  
Unlike a trial judge or prosecutor, the Board is not con-
strained by doctrines such as stare decisis, res judicata, the 
law of the case, or the prohibition on double jeopardy.  See 
Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 376-77.  Third, a parolee can never be 
made worse off by exercising a protected right because if the 
parolee is acquitted, the acquittal weighs in favor of the 
parolee during the revocation proceedings.  Finally, the Unit-
ed States asserts, the government may relitigate acquitted 
conduct in a later proceeding, even to the extent of instituting 
new charges for the same conduct, without giving rise to a 
presumption of vindictiveness.

     We agree with the United States that the district court 
extended the doctrine of prosecutorial vindictiveness beyond 
its moorings.  The trial prosecutor did not initiate the revoca-
tion hearing;  rather, the Board filed a parole violator warrant 
after the court reversed Maddox's conviction at his second 

trial.  The Board is an independent decision maker.  See D.C. 
Code s 24-201.2(a)(4) (1981);  Barnes v. District of Columbia 
Board of Parole, 759 A.2d 1073, 1075-76 (D.C. 2000) (and 
cases cited);  cf. United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 155-57 
(1997).  It is unrestrained by doctrines that bind courts and 
prosecutors, and its reputation for effectively carrying out its 
responsibilities hardly turns on whether a parolee exercises 
his right to go to trial.  The Board, not the trial prosecutor, 
made the decision to revoke Maddox's parole, and that deci-
sion is distinct from the concern about "upping the ante" that 
underlies the prosecutorial vindictiveness doctrine.  Cf. Mey-
er, 810 F.2d at 1246 (citing Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 381).  In 
addition, an acquittal would appear only to help, not harm, a 
defendant in urging the Board that his parole should not be 
revoked.  Moreover, any personal pique of the trial prosecu-
tor about losing his case at trial or a prosecutor's "testy" 
attitude at trial are irrelevant to the existence of prosecutori-
al vindictiveness.  Cf. United States v. Esposito, 968 F.2d 300, 
305 (3rd Cir. 1992).15  Although the district court was troubled 
by what it concluded was the government's "lack of a basic 
sense of decency and fairness," Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 
122, in proceeding against Maddox in a different forum upon 
losing its case after putting Maddox on trial three times, 
resulting in his incarceration for over three years for a crime 
of which a jury acquitted him, see id., such deficiencies are 
relevant to judgment but do not necessarily demonstrate 
vindictiveness.

     Even were we to assume that something akin to prosecuto-
rial vindictiveness applies in the parole revocation context, 
and also to assume that the trial prosecutor's actions are 
troubling to the extent that he was more than a witness, cf. 
Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 789, the record does not support a 
finding that the trial prosecutor's conduct violated Maddox's 
due process rights.  As the district court observed, a trial 

__________
     15  Esposito, 968 F.2d at 305, involved a presumption of vindic-
tiveness.  Maddox suggests no basis for concluding that its reason-
ing for declining to apply the presumption where a prosecutor acts 
for legitimate reasons is inapplicable to a finding of actual vindic-
tiveness.

prosecutor with "intimate knowledge of the evidence" could, 
as a witness, provide helpful assistance to the Board.  Mad-
dox II, 83 F. Supp.2d at 122.  In that sense, there is no legal 
bar to the trial prosecutor's involvement in parole revocation 
hearings.16  Nor do we read 28 U.S.C. s 547 (1994) to be a 
bar.17  See generally Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 787.  Albeit in a 
different context, the court has acknowledged that the United 
States Attorney "is vested with broad discretion to protect 
the public from crime, such discretion being derived both 
from statutory grant and the authority of the Attorney Gen-
eral at common law."  Fay v. Miller, 183 F.2d 986, 988 (D.C. 
Cir. 1950) (interpreting the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. s 547);  
cf. Johnson v. Kegans, 870 F.2d 992, 997-98 (5th Cir. 1989).  
The appearance of the trial prosecutor to assist the Board is 
consistent with this obligation.

     Further, the record does not support the district court's 
finding that the trial prosecutor took over the revocation 
proceeding.  See Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 119-21.  
While the trial prosecutor's involvement in the revocation 
proceedings exceeded that of a witness, the record shows that 
the Board remained in control.  Board members questioned 
the witnesses and attorneys, recalled witnesses, determined 
whether or how witnesses would be cross-examined, asserted 
exclusive authority over relevance and credibility determina-
tions, and controlled the length of arguments.  Maddox does 

__________
     16  The United States acknowledged during the habeas proceed-
ing that the trial prosecutor appeared at the revocation hearing in 
his official capacity as a representative of the United States.  See 
Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  It also did not challenge the 
district court's assumption that the trial prosecutor "did not act 
alone ... [inasmuch as] his actions were approved by three superi-
ors in the United States Attorney's office."  Id. at 122 & n.9.

     17  Section 547(1) provides, that "[e]xcept as otherwise provided 
by law, each United States attorney ... shall prosecute for all 
offenses against the United States."  28 U.S.C. s 547(1) (1994).  
Section 547(2) provides "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, each 
United States attorney ... shall prosecute or defend, for the 
Government, all civil actions, suits or proceedings in which the 
United States is concerned."  Id. s 547(2).

not allege, nor do we find evidence, that the trial prosecutor's 
involvement in the revocation proceedings impaired the abili-
ty of the Board to make an independent revocation decision.  
Whether the Board wished to have the trial prosecutor's 
assistance was a matter within the Board's discretion, and 
provision of that assistance does not show actual vindictive-
ness.

     Because no "reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness exists" 
Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 373, there is no basis for a presumption 
of vindictiveness.  Maddox's criminal prosecution had ended 
before the allegedly vindictive actions took place.  As the 
Third Circuit explained in United States v. Esposito, 968 F.2d 
300 (3rd Cir. 1992), no presumption of prosecutorial vindictive-
ness exists when, after being acquitted of charges under the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 
U.S.C. s 1961 et seq. (1994 & Supp. IV 1998), where certain 
drug offenses were the predicate acts, the defendant was 
subsequently charged with the same drug offenses in a 
second indictment, for:

     [t]he evil that a presumption of vindictiveness seeks to 
     eradicate is the threat of retaliation when an accused 
     exercises a right in the course of the prosecution.  
     Where, however, the prosecutor has done nothing to 
     deter the exercise of one's right during the case or 
     proceeding, and the prosecution has come to a natural 
     end, no presumption of vindictiveness applies.
     
968 F.2d at 303-04.  This reasoning applies with equal force 
to Maddox's situation:  he exercised his rights to appeal and 
to a jury trial and his criminal prosecution ended in acquittal 
before the trial prosecutor appeared at his parole revocation 
hearing.  Cf. United States v. Johnson, 171 F.3d 139 (2nd Cir. 
1999);  United States v. Rodgers, 18 F.3d 1425, 1429-31 (8th 
Cir. 1994);  United States v. Wall, 37 F.3d 1443, 1447-50 (10th 
Cir. 1994).

     Even assuming, as Maddox alleges, that the trial prosecu-
tor acted in retaliation for Maddox's exercise of his rights to 
appeal and to a jury trial, and that a presumption of vindic-
tiveness would be appropriate, the prosecutor's stated pur-

pose for participating in the revocation hearing rebuts the 
presumption.  At the habeas proceeding, the trial prosecutor 
explained that he went to the revocation hearing because he 
wanted to be sure that the Board had a balanced view of the 
charges against Maddox, and because he considered Maddox 
to be a danger to the community, describing his role as 
assisting the Board.18  See Maddox II, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  
While the district court disagreed with the trial prosecutor's 
assessment of the strength of the government's evidence 
against Maddox, concluding that the evidence was solely 
circumstantial and lacked credibility in view of the misstate-
ments by the police officers at trial, see id. at 120-21, the trial 
prosecutor's evaluation of the evidence is distinct from a 
vindictive motive.  Contrary to the district court's finding 
that "[i]f Maddox were a danger to society, then the Parole 
Board should have taken action during the five months subse-
quent to Maddox's release after his first trial," id. at 121, 
there is no evidence that the Board was aware of Maddox's 
release on bond after the first trial.  Consequently, the 
Board's failure to issue a parole violator warrant at that time 
does not undermine the trial prosecutor's view that Maddox 
was a danger to the community.  The fact that the trial 
prosecutor defined "assistance" more broadly than the dis-
trict court is not dispositive because the Board did not 
relinquish its authority over the proceedings.  For these 
reasons, Maddox fails to show that the trial prosecutor's 
stated reasons for attending the revocation hearing were 
pretextual.

     Accordingly, because the district court erred in ruling that 
the Board's ex parte meeting with the trial prosecutor infring-
ed Maddox's due process rights, and in finding that the trial 
prosecutor's conduct at the revocation hearing constituted 
actual vindictiveness, and because there is no basis for a 
__________
     18  The trial prosecutor acknowledged that he had never previ-
ously appeared at a parole revocation hearing even though he had 
been a prosecutor for nearly twenty-two years.  See Maddox II, 83 
F. Supp. 2d at 119.  He advised the Board that he " 'was a parole 
officer at one point.' "  Id. at 117.

presumption of vindictiveness, we reverse the order partially 
granting Maddox's habeas corpus petition.
