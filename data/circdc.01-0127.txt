     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Randell Ware-
house of Arizona, Inc. (Randell) petitions for review of an 
order of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or 
Board) directing it to bargain with the Sheet Metal Workers 
International Association, Local #359, AFL-CIO (Union).  
The NLRB cross-petitions for enforcement.  For the reasons 
stated below, we grant the petition for review and remand to 
the Board for further proceedings.

                                I.

     The facts before us are straightforward.  After the Union 
won a representation election, Randell filed with the Board 
several objections to the election.  Randell contended inter 
alia (1) that numerous acts of intimidation created an atmo-
sphere of coercion that reasonably tended to interfere with 
the free and uncoerced choice of the employees and (2) that 
other acts of interference by Union adherents and agents 
affected the result of the election.  See Randell Warehouse of 
Ariz., Inc., 328 N.L.R.B. No. 153 app. at 19-20, 1999 WL 
554239, at *30 (July 27, 1999).  The Regional Director or-
dered a hearing to consider Randell's objections.  See id. at 
19, 1999 WL 554239, at *29.  Following a two-day hearing, an 

NLRB Hearing Officer made several findings of fact and 
recommendations regarding the relevant issues.

     As to Randell's first objection, the Hearing Officer found 
that a Randell employee and Union supporter, Ray Encinas, 
made certain objectionable comments in two employee meet-
ings held by Randell to discuss unionization.  In the first 
meeting, when one employee inquired what would happen to 
someone who crossed the picket line during a strike, Encinas 
commented in Spanish that " 'they would bring somebody 
from down below to take care of those people.' "  Id. at 21, 
1999 WL 554239, at *33.  In a second meeting, when another 
employee asked what would happen to those who did not 
want to become union members if the Union won the election, 
Encinas volunteered, again in Spanish, " 'they would have the 
Chico Mafia take care of those people.' "  Id.  Furthermore, 
on another occasion, one employee who was wearing a "Vote 
No" button was told by a lead worker "there is people here 
that beat up people that wear that."1  Id., 1999 WL 554239, at 
*34.  Despite these fact findings, the Hearing Officer conclud-
ed that, when measured against the standard governing third-
party conduct in representation elections, the three incidents 
did not "form the basis for setting aside the election" or 
create "an atmosphere of confusion of [sic] fear" that "a free 

__________
     1 At the hearing, a pro-company employee testified that, while he 
was wearing a "Vote No" button, two Union supporters told him to 
"take [it] off" unless he was "looking for trouble."  Deferred 
Appendix (D.A.) 320.  The employee also testified that, later the 
same day, when driving home, he was boxed in by the two Union 
supporters and almost driven off the road.  D.A. 321-25.  The 
Hearing Officer discredited this testimony, concluding that the two 
pro-Union employees "both credibly denied the account of the 
incident as testified to by [the pro-company employee]" and "two 
other credible witnesses" corroborated the pro-Union employees' 
account of the event.  Randell, 328 N.L.R.B. No. 153 app. at 21, 
1999 WL 554239, at *33.  The Hearing Officer did note, however, 
that rumors about the incident spread throughout the plant and 
that a leadman told the pro-company employee to " 'be careful' " 
because " 'they are crazy.' "  Id. at 21, 1999 WL 554239, at *33 
(quoting D.A. 328).

and fair election could not have been held."  Id. at 22, 1999 
WL 554239, at *34.  Accordingly, the Hearing Officer recom-
mended that the Board overrule Randell's objections on this 
issue.

     Regarding the second objection, the Hearing Officer found 
that, before the election, as Union representatives distributed 
Union literature in front of Randell's building, another Union 
representative photographed the employees as they accepted 
or rejected the literature.  See id.  Moreover, the photogra-
pher took pictures of some employees' vehicles as well.  
When one employee asked about the purpose of the photo-
graphs, one of the Union representatives responded "It's for 
the Union purpose, showing transactions that are taking 
place.  The Union could see us handing flyers and how the 
Union is being run."  Id., 1999 WL 554239, at *35.

     The Hearing Officer concluded the Union's conduct was in 
violation of Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 289 
N.L.R.B. 736 (1988) (holding that, absent explanation or 
justification, photographing employees while they engage in 
protected activity violates National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA)).  See id. He therefore recommended that Randell's 
objection based on Union photographing be sustained and a 
new election be held.

     Randell filed exceptions to the Hearing Officer's recom-
mendations.  Of relevance here, Randell argued that threats 
and intimidation by Union supporters destroyed the "labora-
tory conditions"2 required for a representation election.  Ran-
dell supported the Hearing Officer's resolution of the photo-
graphing issue, however, arguing that a new election was 
warranted on that basis and emphasizing that the photo-
graphing did not take place in an atmosphere otherwise free 
of coercion.

     2 General Shoe Corp., 77 N.L.R.B. 124, 127 (1948) (holding that 
representation election should be held in "laboratory . . . conditions 
as nearly ideal as possible, to determine the uninhibited desires of 
the employees").

     The Board adopted all but one of the Hearing Officer's 
recommendations.  It rejected the Hearing Officer's conclu-
sion about the Pepsi-Cola Bottling violation, opting instead to 
overrule Pepsi-Cola Bottling.  See Randell, 328 N.L.R.B. No. 
153, at 3, 1999 WL 554239, at *4.  In light of its decision, the 
Board certified the Union as the collective bargaining repre-
sentative of the appropriate bargaining unit of Randell em-
ployees.  See id. at 5, 1999 WL 554239, at *7.

     Randell refused to bargain with the Union, prompting the 
Union to file an unfair labor practice charge.  The NLRB 
General Counsel issued a complaint and Randell answered.  
In its answer, Randell raised two defenses:  the election was 
tainted by an atmosphere of coercion and intimidation which 
prevented the employees from exercising their rights freely 
and the Board erroneously applied its new photographing 
rule retroactively.  The General Counsel, on the other hand, 
sought summary judgment reasoning that Randell's objec-
tions could have been raised or had already been rejected in 
the representation proceedings.  The Board agreed with the 
General Counsel, found Randell in violation of section 8(a)(5) 
and (1) of the NLRA and ordered Randell to bargain with the 
Union.  See Randell Warehouse of Ariz., Inc., 330 N.L.R.B. 
No. 135, at 2, 2000 WL 345407, at *2-3 (Mar. 20, 2000).  This 
appeal followed.

                               II.

     "On questions regarding representation, we accord the 
Board an especially 'wide degree of discretion.'  NLRB v. 
A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. 324, 330 (1946);  see also C.J. 
Krehbiel Co. v. NLRB, 844 F.2d 880, 882 (D.C. Cir. 1988) 
(citations omitted);  Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Work-
ers, 736 F.2d 1559, 1564 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ('the scope of our 
review of the Board's decisions in cases involving certification 
is extremely limited') (citing Amalgamated Clothing Workers 
of America v. NLRB, 424 F.2d 818, 827 (D.C. Cir. 1970)).  
We will affirm the Board's order to bargain unless the Board 
abused its discretion in overruling [an employer's] objections 
in the underlying election proceeding.  See C.J. Krehbiel Co., 

844 F.2d at 881-82."  Canadian Am. Oil Co. v. NLRB, 82 
F.3d 469, 473 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Yet, "[a]lthough our review is 
deferential, we are not merely 'the Board's enforcement arm.  
It is our responsibility to examine carefully both the Board's 
findings and its reasoning....' "  General Elec. Co. v. NLRB, 
117 F.3d 627, 630 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting Peoples Gas Sys., 
Inc. v. NLRB, 629 F.2d 35, 42 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).  And, 
especially significant here, "the Board cannot ignore its own 
relevant precedent but must explain why it is not controlling."  
B B & L, Inc. v. NLRB, 52 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (per 
curiam) (citing Cleveland Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 44 F.3d 1010, 
1016 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).

     In Pepsi-Cola Bottling, the Board found objectionable a 
union's videotaping of employees being handed union leaflets 
as they left the employer's premises during a union rally.  
289 N.L.R.B. 736.  Because the employees received no legiti-
mate explanation for the videotaping, the Board concluded 
the employees could reasonably believe the Union was con-
templating some future reprisals against them and set aside 
the election as interfering with the employees' right to choose 
their representatives freely.  See id.

     The Board set aside a representation election in Mike 
Yurosek & Son, Inc. as well.  292 N.L.R.B. 1074 (1989).  
There a union representative took photographs of campaign 
activity by pro-union and anti-union employees.  The repre-
sentative also told an anti-union activist "We've got it on film;  
we know who you guys are . . . after the Union wins the 
election some of you may not be here."  Id.  Relying on 
Pepsi-Cola Bottling, the Board again found interference with 
the employees' rights under the NLRA and ordered a new 
election.

     Here the Board, in a volte face, determined that union 
photographing of employees engaged in protected activities 
during an election campaign, without more, does not neces-
sarily interfere with employee free choice.  See Randell, 328 
N.L.R.B. No. 153, at 3, 1999 WL 554239, at *4.  At the same 
time the Board overruled Pepsi-Cola Bottling, it nonetheless 
declined to overrule Mike Yurosek, reasoning that photo-

graphing accompanied by threats or coercive conduct does 
interfere with employee free choice.  See id., 1999 WL 
554239, at *5.  Applying its newly announced rule to the facts 
before it, the Board found no objectionable conduct.  See id. 
at 5, 1999 WL 554239, at *7.

     Randell argues the Board erred by failing to consider the 
applicability of Mike Yurosek here.  We agree.3  We have 
repeatedly told the Board that "silent departure from prece-
dent" will not survive judicial scrutiny.  Cleveland Constr. Co. 
v. NLRB, 44 F.3d 1010, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  accord Gilbert 
v. NLRB, 56 F.3d 1438, 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("It is . . . 
elementary that an agency must conform to its prior decisions 
or explain the reason for its departure from such prece-
dent."), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1171 (1996).  Here, the Hearing 
Officer found that Union supporters engaged in at least three 
separate instances of potentially threatening conduct.  See 
supra at 3.  Moreover, rumors about a fourth and graver 
incident circulated throughout the plant.  See supra note 1.  
In view of these factual findings, the applicability of Mike 
Yurosek is a critical issue the Board should have examined 
carefully.  Yet, having announced that Mike Yurosek would 
continue to apply, the Board failed to explain why the threat-
ening conduct catalogued by the Hearing Officer did not 
amount to objectionable conduct under that case.  As we have 
stated before, "[w]ithout some explanation of how the Board 
reached its conclusion, we have no basis in the record upon 
which to evaluate whether the Board's application of[its] 
rule is rational, based on substantial evidence, and consistent 
with the Board's own precedents."  Lima v. NLRB, 819 
F.2d 300, 303 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Accordingly, we remand to 
the Board "for further consideration and a reasoned opinion, 
thereby providing a meaningful basis for judicial review un-
der 5 U.S.C. s 706(2)."  Id.;  see also Darr v. NLRB, 801 

__________
     3 Randell also contends the Board erred in overruling the per se 
rule of Pepsi-Cola Bottling and in retroactively applying the new 
rule to this case.  Because we remand to the Board on another 
basis, we need not reach these objections.

F.2d 1404, 1408-09 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (remanding where Board 
did not clearly explain basis for its decision).

     For the reasons stated above, we grant Randell's petition 
for review and remand to the Board for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.

                                                                 So ordered.
