     Before:  Ginsburg, Chief Judge, Edwards and Sentelle, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Edwards.

     Edwards, Circuit Judge:  American Electric Power Co., Inc. 
("AEP") and Central and South West Corp. ("CSW"), two 
large regional utility holding companies, jointly petitioned the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC" or "Com-
mission") for merger approval, as required by s 203 of the 
Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. s 824b(a) (1994).  When pre-
sented with a merger or acquisition request, FERC "shall 
approve" the request if the merger or acquisition "will be 
consistent with the public interest."  Id.  After lengthy re-
view, FERC conditionally approved the AEP-CSW merger 
and required the combined company, referred to as New 
AEP, to divest certain generation assets and share transmis-
sion capacity information.  See Am. Elec. Power Co. & Cent. 
& S. W. Corp., 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,242 (Mar. 15, 2000).  Wabash 
Valley Power Association, Inc. ("Wabash"), an Indiana com-
petitor and customer of AEP, petitions for review.

     Wabash contends that FERC's decision was both procedur-
ally and substantively defective.  Many of Wabash's claims 
have been forfeited, however, because they were not properly 
raised with FERC in the first instance.  Therefore, these 
claims may not be considered by the court.  And we find no 
merit in the claims that are properly before this court.

     Because AEP and CSW sought merger approval in the 
midst of sweeping regulatory changes in the electric industry, 
FERC chose to impose "interim" mitigation measures to 
limit New AEP's market power.  Wabash contends that 
FERC's approach is improper under the Federal Power Act, 
because the interim measures are deficient.  We disagree.  
On the record at hand, we find that FERC acted reasonably 
in adopting two stages of restrictions to limit New AEP's 
market power.  Both stages of restrictions adequately limit 

New AEP's ability to strategically manipulate electricity gen-
eration to cause transmission bottlenecks.  We also reject 
Wabash's claims that FERC's merger approval should be 
overturned because it is inconsistent with subsequent staff 
statements and because it did not fully eliminate rate pancak-
ing.  These claims have no bearing on the question of wheth-
er FERC's approval of the merger was arbitrary and capri-
cious.  We therefore deny Wabash's petition for review.

                          I. Background

     AEP and CSW sought to merge in the midst of a sea-
change in the regulations governing the electricity industry.  
Because many of the issues raised by petitioner relate to the 
application of these new regulations, we begin with a brief 
summary of the current regulatory landscape and then move 
to the procedural history of this case.

A.   Current Regulations

     By amending portions of the Federal Power Act of 1935, 
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorized FERC to order 
utilities to transmit other sellers' power over their transmis-
sion lines on a case-by-case basis.  See Pub. L. No. 102-486, 
106 Stat. 2776, 2915-16 (1992) (codified at 16 U.S.C. ss 824j-
k);  Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 225 
F.3d 667 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (hereinafter Transmission Access) 
(discussing history), cert. granted sub nom. New York v. 
FERC, 121 S. Ct. 1185 (2001).  Finding that utilities would 
use their market power to deny transmission access to com-
peting generation sources, FERC subsequently used its stat-
utory authority, see 16 U.S.C. ss 824d(b), 824e(a), to require 
utilities to provide open access to their transmission lines in a 
nondiscriminatory fashion.  See Promoting Wholesale Com-
petition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Trans-
mission Services by Public Utilities, Order No. 888, 61 Fed. 
Reg. 21,540 (May 10, 1996), clarified, 76 F.E.R.C. p 61,009 
(July 2, 1996) and 61 Fed. Reg. 51,696 (Oct. 3, 1996), on reh'g, 
Order No. 888-A, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,274 (Mar. 14, 1997), clari-
fied, 79 F.E.R.C. p 61,182 (May 16, 1997), on reh'g, Order No. 
888-B, 62 Fed. Reg. 64,688 (Dec. 9, 1997), on reh'g, Order No. 

888-C, 82 F.E.R.C. p 61,046 (Jan. 20, 1998), aff'd, Transmis-
sion Access, 225 F.3d 667, cert. granted sub nom. New York, 
121 S. Ct. 1185.  Order No. 888, among other things, set forth 
the framework for creating Independent System Operators 
("ISOs"), independent companies that manage transmission 
facilities owned by utilities.  61 Fed. Reg. at 21,596.  ISOs 
have no financial stake in any power market participant, have 
the ability to halt generation causing transmission system 
constraints, and must provide real-time transmission informa-
tion to market participants.  Id.

     At the same time, FERC also issued Order No. 889 which 
required all owners and operators of electricity transmission 
systems to participate in an Open Access Same-time Informa-
tion System, or OASIS.  Open Access Same-Time Informa-
tion System and Standards of Conduct, Order No. 889, 61 
Fed. Reg. 21,737 (May 10, 1996), on reh'g, Order No. 889-A, 
62 Fed. Reg. 12,484 (Mar. 14, 1997), on reh'g, Order No. 889-
B, 62 Fed. Reg. 64,715 (Dec. 9, 1997), aff'd, Transmission 
Access, 225 F.3d 667, cert. granted sub nom. New York, 121 
S. Ct. 1185.  One of the main functions of an OASIS is to 
calculate Available Transmission Capacity ("ATC"), the dif-
ference between a transmission system's total capacity and 
already-committed capacity.  Order No. 889, 61 Fed. Reg. at 
21,749.  Because ATC often limits where electricity can be 
sold, this information allows generators to determine addi-
tional potential markets.

     In 1999, FERC found that the changes brought by Orders 
Nos. 888 and 889 had imposed significant strain on "tradition-
al means of grid management" and that "continued discrimi-
nation in the provision of transmission services by vertically 
integrated utilities may also be impeding fully competitive 
electricity markets."  Regional Transmission Organizations;  
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 64 Fed. Reg. 31,390, at 
31,391 (June 10, 1999).  Although Orders Nos. 888 and 889 
reduced overt discrimination, transmission-owning utilities re-
sorted to "more subtle means to frustrate their marketing 
competitors and favor their own marketing interests."  Id. at 
31,402.  As a consequence, the Orders were ineffective in 
completely removing transmission discrimination.  Functional 

limitations arising from the relatively small size of the ISOs 
also limited their ability to provide essential information 
accurately, such as ATC:  "it is not possible to calculate 
accurately the transmission capability of one system without 
knowing the flows scheduled by all other interconnected 
transmission providers in the region."  Id. at 31,403.

     In response to the shortcomings of Orders Nos. 888 and 
889, FERC issued Order No. 2000, which established the 
framework for Regional Transmission Organizations, or 
RTOs.  See Regional Transmission Organizations, Order 
No. 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 810 (Jan. 6, 2000), on reh'g, Order No. 
2000-A, 65 Fed. Reg. 12,088 (Mar. 8, 2000), petitions for 
review pending sub nom. Public Utility District No. 1 of 
Snohomish County, Washington v. FERC, No. 00-1174 (D.C. 
Cir. argued Oct. 17, 2001).  RTOs build upon many ISO 
features and have four main characteristics:  independence, 
sufficient size and regional scope, operational authority for all 
transmission facilities under their control, and exclusive au-
thority for maintaining short term grid reliability.  65 Fed. 
Reg. 810, at 842-75.  FERC requires RTOs to be larger, 
more independent, and exercise more sophisticated control 
over the transmission system than ISOs.  In 2001, FERC 
further clarified the scope requirements of RTOs, forcing 
several parties into mediation with an ultimate goal of creat-
ing four RTOs - one for the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, 
and West.  See, e.g., Order Provisionally Granting RTO 
Status, 96 F.E.R.C. p 61,061 (July 12, 2001).

B.   Procedural History

     AEP and CSW jointly applied to FERC for merger approv-
al on April 30, 1998.  At that time, AEP, through wholly-
owned subsidiaries, provided power to three million custom-
ers in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Virgi-
nia, and West Virginia with over 23,000 megawatts ("MW") of 
generating capacity and 22,000 miles of transmission lines.  
Am. Elec. Power Co., 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,242, at 61,776.  CSW, 
also through wholly-owned subsidiaries, served 1.7 million 
customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas with 
over 14,000 MW of generating capacity and 16,000 miles of 

transmission lines.  See Joint Application of Am. Elec. Power 
Co., Inc. & Cent. & S. W. Corp. (Apr. 30, 1998), reprinted in 
Joint Appendix ("J.A.") 134, 165 (hereinafter "Joint Applica-
tion").

     To determine whether a proposed merger meets the Feder-
al Power Act's s 203 public interest standard, FERC re-
quires applicants to conduct a competitive analysis screen, 
referred to as an Appendix A analysis, using the framework 
established by the Department of Justice/Federal Trade 
Commission Merger Guidelines.  See Inquiry Concerning the 
Commission's Merger Policy Under the Federal Power Act;  
Policy Statement, 61 Fed. Reg. 68,595, at 68,606 (Dec. 30, 
1996).  The Appendix A analysis requires applicants to:

     1)   identify the relevant products;
          
     2)   identify customers who may be affected by the merg-
          er;
          
     3)   identify potential competing suppliers to each identi-
          fied customer;  and
          
     4)   analyze market concentration, using the Herfindahl-
          Hirschman Index ("HHI") before and after the merg-
          er.
          
Id. at 68,607-08.

     In their original application, AEP and CSW proposed con-
necting their two territories using a 250 MW east to west 
transmission path, secured by contract from a third party. 
Joint Application, reprinted in J.A. 138.  Because this con-
nection increased market concentration in several western 
markets to a level above that allowed by Appendix A, AEP 
and CSW sought to mitigate these impermissible HHI levels 
by committing to the sale of 320 MW in the former territory 
of CSW.  Joint Application, reprinted in J.A. 145.  AEP and 
CSW also suggested other restrictions, including participation 
in an ISO and the waiver of certain priority transmission 
rights.  Joint Application, reprinted in J.A. 150.

     FERC found that the "Applicants' own analysis shows that 
the proposed merger fails the screen thresholds in several 
markets, ... there are problems concerning the assumptions 

and data used in the Applicants' screen analysis, ... [and] 
Applicants' analysis may not accurately define relevant geo-
graphic markets."  Order Accepting for Filing and Suspend-
ing Proposed Tariffs and Agreements, Consolidating Dock-
ets, and Establishing Hearing Procedures, 85 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,201, at 61,818-19 (Nov. 10, 1998).  These factors led 
FERC to set the matter for a hearing to determine "the 
effect of the merger on competition."  Id. at 61,809.

     Over 30 parties filed objections to the merger, though most 
withdrew prior to the hearing.  FERC trial staff and the 
Applicants entered into two stipulations, one on May 24, 1999, 
and the other on July 13, 1999, resolving most of the issues in 
contention at the hearing.  The three-week hearing finished 
on July 19, 1999, and the presiding Administrative Law Judge 
("ALJ") issued an initial order on November 23, 1999.  The 
ALJ's initial order imposed no conditions on the merger, 
other than those stipulated by the Applicants.  See Am. Elec. 
Power Co., 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,242, at 61,776.  On May 15, 2000, 
FERC approved the merger, but with significant additional 
conditions.  Id. at 61,799-800.

     The Applicants had agreed to divest 550 MW of power, 
rather than the initially proposed 320 MW, from the West 
Region.  Instead of divesting entire plants, the Applicants 
proposed selling minority interests in certain generating facil-
ities, leaving New AEP with operational control of generation.  
FERC found the amount of capacity to be divested acceptable 
but that the divestiture proposal was an ineffective remedy 
because the Applicants retained operational control of the 
generation.  This operational control could have given New 
AEP "the ability to withhold capacity from the market and 
thus affect electricity prices."  Id. at 61,792.  FERC there-
fore required New AEP to "divest their entire ownership 
interest" in the facilities at issue.  Id.  Because of the time 
necessary to divest this capacity, the Applicants proposed 
forced interim power sales equivalent to the to-be-divested 
capacity.  FERC accepted this proposal, recognizing that the 
forced sales would prevent the exercise of market power by 
withholding output, but required the sales to begin immedi-

ately rather than shortly after merger, as the Applicants had 
proposed.  Id. at 61,794.

     FERC also addressed market power concerns arising out 
of the consolidation of generation and transmission.  FERC 
recognized the potential for New AEP to exercise vertical 
market power, where one entity could affect the availability of 
transmission by controlling the generation of electricity, and 
found "that Applicants failed to show that the proposed 
merger will not adversely affect competition as a result of 
combining their generation and transmission."  Id. at 61,786.  
To remedy this market power, FERC imposed several re-
quirements.  First, the Applicants must "transfer operational 
control of their transmission facilities to a Commission-
approved RTO."  Id. at 61,788.  Second, because, under 
FERC's newly established framework, RTOs will not exist 
prior to December 15, 2001, see Order No. 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 
at 812, FERC imposed interim mitigation measures in the 
East Region emulating many of the anticipated functions of 
an RTO.  Am. Elec. Power Co., 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,242 at 
61,789.  Thus, in the East Region, New AEP must have ATC 
calculated and market monitoring conducted by an indepen-
dent party.  This third party would review generation dis-
patch information, steps taken to relieve transmission con-
straints, and the volume and price of energy after relief steps 
were taken.  FERC stated, "[w]e believe that such data are 
necessary to determine whether operations or wholesale 
transactions involving Applicants are unduly discriminatory 
or preferential or show evidence of the exercise of market 
power."  Id.  Third, although FERC did not expressly identi-
fy the consequences of any transgressions of these require-
ments, the Commission stated that it would use its "authority 
under Section 203(b) of the [Federal Power Act] to address 
any concerns, and order further procedures as appropriate."  
Id. at 61,789-90 (footnote omitted).

     Wabash filed a Request for Rehearing on April 14, 2000, 
challenging FERC's order approving the merger.  The prin-
cipal points raised by Wabash in its petition for rehearing 
were, as follows:

     .    The Commission identified serious problems with the 
          merger, expressly recognizing that the merger in-
          creased Applicants' ability to foreclose competitors by 
          strategic manipulation of generation, but approved 
          the merger without conditioning it in a manner that 
          even purports to address this significant threat to the 
          public interest.
          
     .    The Commission recognized, but failed to address the 
          potent arguments of Wabash Valley ... that Appli-
          cants' participation in the Alliance RTO, even if that 
          RTO were to satisfy the Commission's general re-
          quirements for FERC approval, would be insufficient 
          to mitigate the Applicants' merger enhanced market 
          power.
          
     .    The Commission erred by failing to insist upon imple-
          mentation of Applicants' RTO commitment before 
          consummation of the merger.
          
     .    The Commission failed even to recognize, much less 
          address, intervenor demonstrations that the merger 
          would seriously adversely affect transmission avail-
          ability to others.
          
     .    The Commission accepted as "ratepayer protection" 
          provisions wholly inadequate to hold ratepayers 
          harmless from the merger.
          
Request for Rehearing, reprinted in J.A. 370, 373.  FERC 
denied the request for rehearing on May 15, 2000, 91 
F.E.R.C. p 61,129, and Wabash petitioned this court for re-
view on July 7, 2000.

                           II. Analysis

A.   Jurisdiction and Ripeness

     FERC initially argues that judicial review is precluded in 
this case, because Wabash is not an aggrieved party, the case 
is not ripe, and Wabash failed to raise many of its arguments 
below, as required by s 313 of the Federal Power Act.  We 
conclude that Wabash is aggrieved and the case is ripe, but 
that many of Wabash's claims have been forfeited because 

they were not properly raised with FERC in the first in-
stance.

     1.   Standing
          
     The Federal Power Act provides that "[a]ny party to a 
proceeding ... aggrieved by an order issued by the Commis-
sion in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order" by 
filing suit within 60 days.  16 U.S.C. s 825l(b).  Under 
FERC regulations, Wabash, as an intervenor, was a party to 
the AEP-CSW merger application proceeding.  See 18 C.F.R. 
s 385.214 (1999).  Parties are "aggrieved" under the Federal 
Power Act if they satisfy both the constitutional and pruden-
tial requirements for standing.  Louisiana Energy & Power 
Auth. v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364, 366 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting 
Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997)).  In this case, as a 
competitor crying foul, Wabash satisfies prudential standing 
requirements.  Louisiana Energy, 141 F.3d at 366-67 (stating 
"as a competitor and customer [petitioner] comes within the 
zone of interests of the Federal Power Act and hence has 
prudential standing").

     FERC nonetheless argues that Wabash fails to satisfy the 
standing requirements imposed by Article III of the Constitu-
tion.

     This "irreducible constitutional minimum" of standing 
     requires:  (1) that the plaintiff have suffered an "injury in 
     fact"--an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest 
     which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or 
     imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;  (2) that there 
     be a causal connection between the injury and the con-
     duct complained of--the injury must be fairly traceable 
     to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the 
     result of the independent action of some third party not 
     before the court;  and (3) that it be likely, as opposed to 
     merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a 
     favorable decision.
     
Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167 (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wild-
life, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)).  FERC contends in particu-
lar that Wabash lacks standing because the harm that it 

alleges is based only on injuries that might arise from New 
AEP's exercise of market power in the future.  In other 
words, according to FERC, the injuries asserted by Wabash 
are merely speculative.  We disagree.

     Parties suffer cognizable injury under Article III when an 
agency "lift[s] regulatory restrictions on their competitors or 
otherwise allow[s] increased competition."  Louisiana Ener-
gy, 141 F.3d at 367.  Wabash asserts that it will be injured by 
New AEP's market power which FERC has allowed by 
approving a merger with inadequate conditions.  This claim 
satisfies the "injury" prong of Article III standing.  See 
Associated Gas Distribs. v. FERC, 899 F.2d 1250, 1259 (D.C. 
Cir. 1990) (finding standing when "the challenged action 
authorizes allegedly illegal transactions that have the clear 
and immediate potential to compete with the petitioners' own 
sales"). Wabash likewise meets the remaining two prongs of 
the constitutional standing inquiry.  Its competitive injury is 
fairly traceable to FERC's decision to approve the merger.  
See America's Cmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 827 
(D.C. Cir. 2000).  And a favorable decision by this court could 
result in a remand to FERC which, in turn, might impose 
conditions that more severely limit New AEP's exercise of 
market power.  This possibility, even though far from certain, 
satisfies the redressability requirement.  Northeast Energy 
Assocs. v. FERC, 158 F.3d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Wa-
bash, therefore, has Article III standing to seek judicial 
review.

     2.   Ripeness
          
     Ripeness requires the evaluation of "the fitness of the 
issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of 
withholding court consideration."  Whitman v. Am. Trucking 
Ass'ns, Inc., 121 S. Ct. 903, 915 (2001) (quoting Abbott Labs. 
v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)).  A case is ripe "when it 
presents a concrete legal dispute and no further factual 
development is essential to clarify the issues and there is no 
doubt whatever that the challenged agency practice has crys-
tallized sufficiently for purposes of judicial review."  Rio 
Grande Pipeline Co. v FERC, 178 F.3d 533, 540 (D.C. Cir. 

1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  This 
dispute meets these criteria.

     Wabash seeks review of a specific agency decision to allow 
the merger of AEP and CSW.  FERC made its decision after 
a lengthy hearing before an ALJ in which Wabash and 
numerous other intervenors put on extensive evidence chal-
lenging the merger.  It does not matter that the merger 
occurs at a time when the regulatory regime is changing.  
What matters is that the decision approving the merger is 
final and the standards for assessing the Commission's judg-
ment are clear and easy to apply.

     3.   Wabash's Failure to Present Certain Claims to FERC 
          in the First Instance
          
     Petitioners seeking review of a FERC order must first 
"petition for rehearing of those orders and must themselves 
raise in that petition all of the objections urged on appeal."  
Platte River Whooping Crane v. FERC, 876 F.2d 109, 113 
(D.C. Cir. 1989) (citing 16 U.S.C. s 825l(b) and ASARCO, Inc. 
v. FERC, 777 F.2d 764, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  Section 825l(b) 
commands that "[n]o objection to the order of the Commis-
sion shall be considered ... [unless] urged before the Com-
mission in the application for rehearing."  16 U.S.C. 
s 825l(b).  This is an unusually strict requirement that will 
not be ignored by the courts.  Asarco, 777 F.2d at 774.  And 
"[n]either FERC nor this court has authority to waive these 
statutory requirements."  Platte River Whooping Crane, 876 
F.2d at 113.  Therefore, the failure of FERC to challenge a 
petitioner's objection on the ground that it was not raised 
below does not remove this court's independent obligation to 
determine whether, in fact, the argument is properly before 
us.

     Many of the objections raised by Wabash in its petition for 
review were not raised in the first instance in an application 
for rehearing to FERC.  The court therefore has no jurisdic-
tion to consider these objections.  In particular, Wabash did 
not seek rehearing on its claims that FERC failed to make 
essential findings of fact, adequately explain its decision, 
define the relevant markets, account for potential competition 

between AEP and CSW, and defer approval of all mergers 
until RTO performance could be evaluated.

     There is one claim that has been raised by Wabash that 
may be considered by the court even though it was not raised 
below.  Wabash contends that FERC's merger was inconsis-
tent with a subsequently released staff report.  Though not 
raised in the application for rehearing by Wabash, this argu-
ment may be properly considered by this court because the 
Federal Power Act allows consideration of arguments raised 
for the first time on appeal if "there is reasonable ground for 
failure" to raise objections in the request for rehearing.  16 
U.S.C. s 825l(b).  Because this report was issued on Novem-
ber 1, 2000, several months after Wabash's rehearing request, 
this court has jurisdiction to review this challenge by Wabash.

     Finally, there is one argument raised by Wabash on appeal 
that is hard to characterize.  In its petition for rehearing to 
FERC, Wabash argued that, although the Commission had 
"expressly recogniz[ed] that the merger increased Applicants' 
ability to foreclose competitors by strategic manipulation of 
generation," the merger conditions did not "address this 
significant threat to the public interest."  Request for Rehear-
ing, reprinted in J.A. 374.  On appeal, Wabash argues that 
"FERC completely ignored ... crucial evidence" of New 
AEP's "ability to manipulate 'imperfections' in the pertinent 
markets to their advantage."  Petitioner's Br. at 37.  How 
one assesses these two claims depends upon how one con-
strues the reference to "crucial evidence."  Wabash's two 
claims are not inconsistent if Wabash's argument to the court 
is meant to claim that FERC failed adequately to address a 
recognized threat to the public interest because it failed to 
consider crucial evidence.  The claims are inconsistent, how-
ever, if Wabash's argument to this court is meant to say that 
FERC completely ignored the fact that the merger increased 
Applicants' ability to foreclose competitors by strategic ma-
nipulation of generation.  We give Wabash the benefit of the 
doubt and accept the issue as raised, because the first con-
struction seems more plausible.  We must therefore address 
on the merits the staff report claim, the crucial evidence 

claim, and two other claims Wabash raised in its petition for 
rehearing.

B.   Standard of review

     We review FERC's order under the familiar arbitrary and 
capricious standard.  Sithe/Independence Power Partners, 
L.P. v. FERC, 165 F.3d 944, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Under 
s 203 of the Federal Power Act "FERC may approve a 
merger only if it 'will be consistent with the public interest.' "  
Envtl. Action, Inc. v. FERC, 939 F.2d 1057, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 
1991) (quoting 16 U.S.C. s 824b(a)).  "Public interest" encom-
passes "both the preservation of economic competition, as 
expressed in the antitrust laws of general application, and the 
various policies reflected in the statutes specific to energy 
regulation."  Envtl. Action, 939 F.2d at 1061 (citations omit-
ted).  The principal public interest reflected in the Federal 
Power Act is "to encourage the orderly development of 
plentiful supplies of electricity and natural gas at reasonable 
prices."  NAACP v. FPC, 425 U.S. 662, 669-70 (1976) (foot-
note omitted).

C.   Wabash's claims

     Wabash claims that FERC's approval was arbitrary and 
capricious because:  FERC improperly conditioned the merg-
er on the future participation of New AEP in an RTO;  
FERC completely ignored crucial evidence of New AEP's 
ability to manipulate imperfections in the pertinent markets 
to their advantage;  the merger is inconsistent with a recent 
FERC staff report;  and the merger does nothing to eliminate 
rate pancaking, a type of rate inefficiency.  These claims all 
fail.

     First FERC did not condition the merger solely on future 
participation in an RTO.  Rather, FERC also required inter-
im measures that emulated the information-sharing features 
of an RTO to limit New AEP's ability to exercise its market 
power.  See Am. Elec. Power Co., 90 F.E.R.C. p 62,171, at 
61,789.  These measures - market monitoring and calculation 
of ATC by independent parties - do not have any enforce-
ment mechanisms attached.  FERC can use its regulatory 

powers, however, to penalize noncompliance.  Under s 205 of 
the Federal Power Act, FERC reviews all electricity trans-
mission and sales to ensure that the rates are "just and 
reasonable."  16 U.S.C. s 824d(a).  FERC, in some circum-
stances, allows electric utilities to engage in market-based 
pricing in lieu of the traditional cost plus reasonable rate of 
return rate calculation.  See, e.g., Cajun Elec. Power Coop., 
Inc. v. FERC, 28 F.3d 173, 176. (D.C. Cir. 1994).  If, however, 
FERC finds that a rate charged is "unjust, unreasonable, 
unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall 
determine the just and reasonable rate ... and shall fix the 
same by order."  16 U.S.C. s 824e(a).  Thus, if the informa-
tion disclosed by New AEP under the interim mitigation 
measures indicates a violation of the antitrust laws or the 
Federal Power Act, New AEP faces antitrust liability and the 
possibility of FERC setting its rates.  These safeguards 
render the requirement of disclosure effective to limit New 
AEP's exercise of strategic behavior to circumvent FERC's 
merger conditions.

     Wabash is also wrong in its claim that FERC completely 
ignored crucial evidence of New AEP's ability to manipulate 
imperfections in the pertinent markets to their advantage.  
As noted above, Wabash's petition for rehearing to FERC 
expressly acknowledges that the Commission did not ignore 
the problem of the potential for market manipulation.  There-
fore, the only question here is whether FERC's action was 
arbitrary and capricious for lack of consideration of some 
"crucial evidence" related to the issue.  The "crucial evi-
dence" to which Wabash refers is "the merging parties' intent 
to improperly exert their market power."  Petitioner's Br. at 
37.  This is a specious claim.  First, it is clear that FERC 
understood that it was too easy for parties to engage in 
market manipulation under the Orders that preceded Order 
No. 2000 - indeed, that was a principal reason for the 
adoption of Order No. 2000.  Second, FERC addressed the 
problem of possible manipulations by imposing conditions on 
the merger.  It is unclear what other "crucial evidence" was 
before FERC that warranted consideration.  Maybe Wabash 
means to suggest that officials in charge of New AEP had 
devious, albeit unannounced, intentions to defy the law with-

out regard to FERC's regulatory requirements.  If so, this 
surely is no basis upon which to grant the petition for review.  
If New AEP acts in violation of the law in the future it will 
face regulatory sanctions.

     Wabash next claims that FERC's decision does nothing to 
eliminate rate pancaking.  Pancaked rates arise when a 
transmission travels over the transmission systems of more 
than one system that each charge separate fees, much like 
the total tolls paid when driving on a route that includes both 
the Pennsylvania and New Jersey turnpikes.  Though the 
mere existence of different owners of different parts of a 
transmission system does not necessarily lead to inefficient 
transmission, FERC found that one of the main benefits 
offered by RTOs would be "increased efficiency through 
regional transmission pricing and the elimination of rate 
pancaking."  Order No. 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. at 829.  Whether 
the AEP-CSW merger eliminated rate pancaking was not a 
discrete issue under consideration by FERC, because s 203 
of the Federal Power Act merely mandates the determination 
of whether the merger is consistent with the public interest.  
By forcing New AEP to transfer its transmission assets to a 
RTO, FERC, in fact, significantly reduced rate pancaking.  
Absent a mechanism creating national transmission pricing, it 
is hard to understand how any merger could, by itself, 
eliminate all rate pancaking.  In any event, that other 
changes to FERC policy might also improve the public inter-
est is simply irrelevant to the validity of the merger decision.  
And it certainly was not arbitrary and capricious for FERC 
to find that a merger that did not fully eliminate rate 
pancaking was nonetheless in the public interest.

     Finally, Wabash claims that the decision to approve the 
merger is arbitrary and capricious because it is inconsistent 
with a staff report produced by FERC on November 1, 2000.  
This claim fails under the holding of Union Pac. Fuels, Inc. v 
FERC, 129 F.3d 157, 164 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Only when 
"FERC has formally altered its policy after issuing an order 
challenged before us" does this court consider the change.  
Id.  A staff report following the issuance of a Commission 
order is not a superceding order;  therefore, the issuance of 

such a report "play[s] no role in our determination of the 
order['s] legality."  Id.

                         III. Conclusion

     For the foregoing reasons, Wabash's petition for review is 
denied.
