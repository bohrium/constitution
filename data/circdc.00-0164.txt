     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  On September 
17, 1996 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or 
Commission) granted Omnipoint Corporation (Omnipoint) 
eighteen broadband personal communications services (PCS) 
licenses for C Block spectrum which it won at auction.  
Because Omnipoint was a qualifying "small business" the 
FCC financed ninety per cent of Omnipoint's auction bid at a 
7% interest rate "based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Trea-
sury obligations applicable on the date the license is granted."  
47 C.F.R. s 24.711(b)(3).  Omnipoint requested a waiver of 
the 7% interest rate calculated under section 24.711(b)(3), 
arguing that it contravened the FCC's policy of setting inter-
est rates "no higher than the government's cost of money," 
which was then 6.5%.  In re Implementation of Section 309(j) 
of the Communications Act--Competitive Bidding, Second 
Report and Order, 9 F.C.C.R. 2348, 2390 (1994).  The FCC's 
Bureau of Wireless Communications (Bureau) first denied 
Omnipoint's waiver request, a decision the Commission ulti-
mately affirmed, finding that strict adherence to section 
24.711(b)(3) did not frustrate its underlying policy or unduly 
burden Omnipoint contrary to the public interest.  We deny 
Omnipoint's petition for review of the FCC's waiver denial.

                                I.

     In 1993 the United States Congress authorized the FCC to 
allocate spectrum by auction and directed it to promulgate 
rules "to ensure that small businesses ... are given the 
opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based 
services."  47 U.S.C. s 309(j)(4)(D).  In setting up the small 

business preference, the FCC identified "two broad, basic ... 
policy goals:  promoting economic growth and enhancing ac-
cess to telecommunications service offerings for consumers, 
producers, and new entrants."  Second Report and Order, 9 
F.C.C.R. at 2349.  The FCC intended its rules to foster 
economic growth by ensuring "that small businesses ... are 
given the opportunity to participate in both the competitive 
bidding process and the provision of spectrum-based ser-
vices."  Id. at 2388.  It promulgated section 24.711(b)(3), 
establishing the interest rate for small business auction win-
ners "based on the rate of the U.S. Treasury obligations (with 
maturities closest to the duration of the license term) at the 
time of licensing."  Id. at 2410 (codified at 47 C.F.R. 
s 24.711(b)(3)).  In promulgating section 24.711(b)(3) the 
FCC stated:

     Finally, we also agree with those commenters that sug-
     gest that interest on installments should be charged at a 
     rate no higher than the government's cost of money.  We 
     recognize that, in addition to providing a source of fi-
     nancing that might not otherwise be available to small 
     entities, we should impose interest in a manner that is 
     designed to provide significant financial assistance to 
     small businesses.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that 
     this government financing results in significant capital 
     cost savings to small businesses, we will impose interest 
     on installment payments equal to the rate for U.S. Trea-
     sury obligations of maturity equal to the license term.  
     This rate is generally lower than the prime lending rate 
     established by private banks.
     
Id. at 2390-91.1  The FCC consistently applied the Treasury 
note rate in assigning installment payment interest rates.  

__________
     1 In 1995 the FCC amended section 24.711(b)(3) to provide for an 
interest rate "based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obli-
gations applicable on the date the license is granted."  See Race 
and Gender Based Provisions for Auctioning C Block Broadband 
Personal Communications Services Licenses, 60 Fed. Reg. 37,786, 
37,796 (1995) (codified at 47 C.F.R. s 24.711(b)(3)).  The amended 

See In re Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communi-
cations Act--Competitive Bidding, Fifth Report and Order, 9 
F.C.C.R. 5532, 5592-93 (1994) ("Interest will accrue at the 
Treasury note rate.");  In re Implementation of Section 309(j) 
of the Communications Act--Competitive Bidding, Sixth Re-
port and Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 136, 156-59 (1995), aff'd, Omni-
point Corp. v. FCC, 78 F.3d 620 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Interest will 
be charged "at a rate equal to ten-year U.S. Treasury obli-
gations applicable on the date the license is granted.").

     On September 17, 1996, after auction, the FCC granted 
Omnipoint eighteen broadband PCS licenses for C Block 
spectrum.  As a qualifying small business Omnipoint was 
eligible for government-sponsored financing of ninety per 
cent of its winning bid obligation and a favorable interest rate 
on its debt.  See Second Report and Order, 9 F.C.C.R. at 
2389-90;  47 C.F.R. s 24.711(b).  At the time the "rate for 
ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations" was 7%, set by the 
August 1996 United States Treasury auction.  As both sides 
agree, however, the August 1996 Treasury auction was "un-
usual."  In re Requests for Waiver of Section 24.711(b)(3) of 
the Comm'n's Rules Establishing the Interest Rate on In-
stallment Payments for C Block PCS Licensees, Memoran-
dum Opinion and Order, 14 F.C.C.R. 9298, 9302 (1999).

     Treasury auctions for ten-year notes are typically held in 
February, May, August and November of each year using a 
competitive bidding methodology.2  In 1996, however, for the 

__________
version applies to Omnipoint.  After a 1998 amendment not relevant 
here, section 24.711(b)(3) now provides for an interest rate based on 
the ten-year Treasury note "plus 2.5 percent."  Competitive Bid-
ding Process, 63 Fed. Reg. 2315, 2349 (1998) (codified at 47 C.F.R. 
s 24.711(b)(3)).

     2 The Treasury auctions ten-year notes by accepting investors' 
written bids specifying the lowest asking yield and moving upward 
until it raises a targeted amount of money.  Each auction estab-
lishes a yield and a coupon rate.  Treasury regulations define 
"yield" as the "annualized rate of return to maturity on a note or 
bond expressed as a percentage."  31 C.F.R. s 356.2.  The coupon 
rate, which a ten-year note bears, is "set at a 1/8 of one percent 

first time since 1980, the Treasury Department auctioned ten-
year notes in July and then reopened the July auction in 
August.  As a result, the August notes bore the coupon rate 
of 7% from the July auction even though the rate in fact 
reflected neither the August auction results, nor August 
market conditions nor the government's actual cost of mon-
ey--a yield of 6.535%.  Instead, the bidders in the August 
auction paid a premium for the ten-year notes.  According to 
Omnipoint, had the Treasury Department instead issued a 
new security in August, "the average auction yield of 6.535% 
would have dictated a coupon rate of 6.5% on the new 
security."  John Friel Decl. 2 (Dec. 11, 1996).  On December 
16, 1996 Omnipoint filed a request for waiver of section 
24.711(b)(3), claiming that, because of the August auction's 
"unusual circumstances," the FCC's use of the 7% coupon 
rate contravened both its policy of setting interest rates at no 
more than the government's cost of money and the public 
interest.  Omnipoint requested that the FCC instead apply a 
6.5% interest rate based on the August auction's weighted 
yield.  The Bureau denied Omnipoint's waiver request and 
the FCC, on June 2, 1999, affirmed the Bureau's denial.  
Omnipoint then timely petitioned for review.

                               II.

     The FCC interpreted "rate" as used in section 24.711(b)(3) 
as the coupon rate and therefore applied the August auction's 
7% coupon rate for ten-year notes to Omnipoint's installment 
payments.3  See Memorandum Opinion and Order, 14 
F.C.C.R. at 9303.  Omnipoint contends that the FCC arbi-

__________
increment" which is "closest to, but not above, par when evaluated 
at the weighted-average yield of awards to successful competitive 
bidders."  Id. s 356.20(b).

     3 Omnipoint contends that the FCC arbitrarily interpreted "rate" 
as the coupon rate instead of the yield.  Such an argument, 
however, is beyond the scope of a waiver request.  See WAIT 
Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1969) ("The very 
essence of waiver is the assumed validity of the general rule, and 
also the applicant's violation unless waiver is granted.").

trarily and capriciously denied its waiver request, ignoring 
the required "hard look" standard.  BellSouth Corp. v. FCC, 
162 F.3d 1215, 1224-25 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (Waiver requests "are 
not subject to perfunctory treatment, but must be given a 
hard look.") (quotation omitted).  According to the FCC 
waiver rule:

          The Commission may grant a request for waiver if it is 
     shown that:
     
          (i) The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be 
     served or would be frustrated by application to the 
     instant case and that a grant of the requested waiver 
     would be in the public interest;  or
     
          (ii) In view of the unique or unusual factual circum-
     stances of the instant case, application of the rule(s) 
     would be inequitable, unduly burdensome or contrary to 
     the public interest, or the applicant has no reasonable 
     alternative.
     
47 C.F.R. s 1.925(b)(3).  Omnipoint assumes a "heavy" bur-
den because "an agency's refusal to grant a waiver will not be 
overturned unless the agency's reasons are so insubstantial as 
to render that denial an abuse of discretion."  Mountain 
Solutions, Ltd., Inc. v. FCC, 197 F.3d 512, 517 (D.C. Cir. 
1999) (quotations omitted).  Furthermore, "the agency's strict 
construction of a general rule in the face of waiver requests is 
insufficient evidence of an abuse of discretion."  Id. (citing 
BellSouth, 162 F.3d at 1225).

     Omnipoint argues that section 24.711(b)(3)'s underlying 
purpose is to provide financing to C Block licensees at a rate 
"no higher than the government's cost of money."  The 
record, however, does not support Omnipoint's "restricted 
view of the Commission's goals and purposes."  BellSouth, 
162 F.3d at 1224.  The FCC initially articulated its purpose 
as "promoting economic growth and enhancing access to 
telecommunications service offerings for consumers, produc-
ers, and new entrants."  Second Report and Order, 9 
F.C.C.R. at 2348.  To that end the FCC allowed a small 
business licensee to pay for its licenses in installment pay-
ments over the license term.  See 47 C.F.R. s 24.711(b).  The 

FCC also "agree[d] with those commenters that suggest that 
interest on installments should be charged at a rate no higher 
than the government's cost of money."  Second Report and 
Order, 9 F.C.C.R. at 2390.  But the FCC stopped short of 
committing itself and ultimately retreated from the notion 
that its purpose was to provide an interest rate no higher 
than the government's cost of money.  Instead, the FCC 
considered section 24.711(b)(3) to represent "an identifiable 
benchmark" for interest rates.  Memorandum Order and 
Opinion, 14 F.C.C.R. at 9303 ("The Commission has recog-
nized that Treasury auctions provide an identifiable bench-
mark on which to base interest rates for installment pay-
ments, but may not always reflect the government's cost of 
money.") (citing Amendment of Part 1 of the Comm'n's 
Rules--Competitive Bidding Proceeding, Order, Memoran-
dum Opinion and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
12 F.C.C.R. 5686, 5709 (1997)).  The FCC clarified that "[t]he 
policy behind our installment payment plan was to facilitate 
small business participation in our auction process by, among 
other things, application of the low interest rates used in the 
Treasury auctions."  Id.;  see also Second Report and Order, 
9 F.C.C.R. at 2390-91 (FCC intended to provide financing "in 
a manner that is designed to provide significant financial 
assistance" at rates "generally lower than the prime lending 
rate established by private banks.").  The 7% interest rate, 
while higher than the government's cost of money in August 
1996, was nevertheless significantly lower than the 11.625% 
interest rate private banks were then charging.  See Memo-
randum Opinion and Order, 14 F.C.C.R. at 9303 n.39.  We 
conclude that the FCC reasonably determined that strict 
adherence to section 24.711(b)(3) did not frustrate its underly-
ing purpose to provide interest rates lower than those of 
private banks.

     Additionally, Omnipoint failed to show that its "unusual 
factual circumstances" made the application of section 
24.711(b)(3) to its installment payments inequitable or con-
trary to the public interest.  Although the August 1996 
Treasury auction was unusual, Omnipoint claims that its 
additional $6 million dollar cost (over ten years) resulting 

from the 0.5% interest rate difference harms the public 
interest.  Omnipoint cannot satisfy the public interest re-
quirement, however, merely by "equat[ing] its own business 
interest with the public interest."  BellSouth, 162 F.3d at 
1225.  We conclude that the FCC did not abuse its discretion 
in denying Omnipoint's request for a waiver from section 
24.711(b)(3) in that it reasonably determined that "the Bureau 
gave [Omnipoint's] waiver request a 'hard look' " and that 
Omnipoint did not show how a waiver would serve the public 
interest.  Id.  Accordingly, Omnipoint's petition for review of 
the FCC's waiver denial is

                                                             Denied.
