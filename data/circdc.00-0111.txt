     Before:  Henderson, Randolph and Garland, Circuit 
Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Local 702 and 
Local 148 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers, AFL-CIO (collectively Unions) challenge a decision 
of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB, Board) hold-
ing that the Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS) 
did not commit an unfair labor practice when it locked out its 
employees during contract negotiations.  CIPS, 326 N.L.R.B. 
No. 89, 1998 WL 600788 (Aug. 27, 1988).  Reversing the 
decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ), the Board 
found that the lockout, implemented in response to the Un-
ions' "inside game" tactics, was not "inherently destructive of 
employee rights," was justified by legitimate business inter-
ests and was not motivated by anti-union animus.  Because 
we conclude the Board's decision is in accord with the law and 
supported by substantial evidence, we deny the Unions' peti-
tions for review.

                                I.

     In April 1992 CIPS, a public utility which generates and 
distributes electricity and gas in Illinois, began negotiating 
with each of the Unions over contracts to succeed those 
expiring in June 1992.  When no agreement was reached by 

March 1993 CIPS submitted a "final" offer to each of the 
Unions, which each voted to reject.  In lieu of striking, the 
Unions decided to institute an "inside game" strategy under 
which their members agreed to refuse to work voluntary 
over-time and generally to "work-to-rule" (e.g., "adhering 
strictly to all company safety and other rules;  doing exactly 
and only what they were told;  reporting to work precisely on 
time and parking work trucks at company facilities at day's 
end (thus precluding employees from responding to after-
hours emergencies);  presenting all grievances as a group;  
advising non-employees to report unsafe conditions;  and ad-
vising customers of their right to various company informa-
tion and of their right to have their meters checked annually 
for accuracy," CIPS, slip op. at 1, 1998 WL 600788, at *1).  
The Unions began the inside game strategy on April 24, 1993 
and continued to negotiate while carrying it out.  At 4:00 a.m. 
on May 20, 1993 CIPS instituted a lockout of all members of 
the two locals.  Negotiations continued during the lockout 
and CIPS reached an agreement with Local 148 in June, 
thereby ending the lockout of its members.  Local 148 none-
theless remained off the job in support of Local 702.  CIPS 
ended the lockout of Local 702 on August 25, 1993, although 
no contract agreement was reached until January 1994.

     Each of the Unions filed unfair labor practice charges with 
the NLRB, alleging violations of section 8(a)(1), (3) and (5) of 
the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1), (3), 
(5).  Following a hearing the ALJ judge issued a decision 
dated May 20, 1996, which found that CIPS had violated all 
three cited subsections.  In relevant part, the ALJ's decision 
concluded that the work-to-rule campaign constituted protect-
ed activity for which the lockout was intended as punishment 
in violation of section 8(a)(3).  In a 2-1 decision dated August 
27, 1998 the Board reversed the ALJ on the section 8(a)(3) 
lockout charge, concluding the lockout was instituted not out 
of anti-union animus but with the dual "legitimate and sub-
stantial" business justifications of facilitating contract negoti-
ations and of countering the economic effects of the inside 
game strategy.  See CIPS, slip op. at 4-7, 1998 WL 600788, at 
*6-10.

                               II.

     The Unions challenge both the Board's interpretation of the 
law and its factual findings.  "The courts accord a very high 
degree of deference to administrative adjudications by the 
NLRB."  United Steelworkers Local 14534 v. NLRB, 983 
F.2d 240, 244 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  "The Board has primary 
responsibility for applying the general provisions of the [Na-
tional Labor Relations Act], and where its interpretation of 
what the Act requires is reasonable, in light of the purposes 
of the Act and the controlling precedent of the Supreme 
Court, courts should respect its policy choices."  United Food 
& Commercial Workers Int'l Union v. NLRB, 880 F.2d 1422, 
1428 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (citing Pattern Makers' League of N. 
Am. v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985);  Automobile Salesmen's 
Union Local 1095 v. NLRB, 711 F.2d 383 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).  
"[W]ith respect to questions of fact," "the findings of the 
Board ... if supported by substantial evidence on the record 
considered as a whole shall be conclusive."  29 U.S.C. 
s 160(e).  "Where the Board has disagreed with the ALJ, as 
occurred here, the standard of review with respect to the 
substantiality of the evidence does not change."  United Food 
& Commercial Workers v. NLRB, 768 F.2d 1463, 1469-70 
(D.C. Cir. 1985) (citing Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 
340 U.S. 474, 496 (1951);  General Teamsters Local Union 
No. 174 v. NLRB, 723 F.2d 966, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).  
Nevertheless, "cases have made clear that '[t]he findings and 
decision of the [ALJ] form an important part of the "record" 
on which [the] judgment of substantiality is to be based,' 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local No. 310 v. 
NLRB, 587 F.2d 1176, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 1978), and that the 
Board, when it disagrees with the ALJ, 'must make clear the 
basis of its disagreement ...' General Teamsters, supra, 723 
F.2d at 971."  Id. at 1470 (alteration in original).  In the end, 
however, "[s]ince the Board is the agency entrusted by Con-
gress with the responsibility for making findings under the 
statute, 'it is not precluded from reaching a result contrary to 
that of the [ALJ] when there is substantial evidence in 
support of each result,' " and " 'is free to substitute its 
judgment for the [ALJ]'s.' "  Carpenters Local 33 v. NLRB, 

873 F.2d 316, 319 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting Sign & Pictorial 
U., Local 1175 v. NLRB, 419 F.2d 726, 734 (D.C. Cir. 1969) 
(alteration in original)).  Because we conclude the Board's 
decision here was supported by substantial evidence and its 
disagreement with the ALJ fully explained, we do not disturb 
it.

     Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act pro-
vides in relevant part:  "It shall be an unfair labor practice for 
an employer ... (3) by discrimination in regard to hire or 
tenure of employment or any term or condition of employ-
ment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor 
organization:...."  29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(3).  In NLRB v. Great 
Dane Trailers, 388 U.S. 26 (1967), the United States Supreme 
Court construed its precedent to establish a comprehensive 
framework for analyzing allegations of a section 8(a)(3) viola-
tion:

     The statutory language 'discrimination * * * to * * * 
     discourage' means that the finding of a violation normally 
     turns on whether the discriminatory conduct was moti-
     vated by an antiunion purpose.  American Ship Build-
     ing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 380 U.S. 300, 
     85 S.Ct. 955 (1965).  It was upon the motivation element 
     that the Court of Appeals based its decision not to grant 
     enforcement, and it is to that element which we now 
     turn. In three recent opinions we considered employer 
     motivation in the context of asserted s 8(a)(3) violations.  
     American Ship Building Co. v. National Labor Rela-
     tions Board, supra;  National Labor Relations Board v. 
     Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965);  
     and National Labor Relations Board v. Erie Resistor 
     Corp., [373 U.S. 221, 227, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 1144-45, 10 
     L.Ed.2d 308 (1963)].  We noted in Erie Resistor, supra, 
     373 U.S. at 227, 83 S.Ct. at 1144, that proof of an 
     antiunion motivation may make unlawful certain employ-
     er conduct which would in other circumstances be lawful.  
     Some conduct, however, is so 'inherently destructive of 
     employee interests' that it may be deemed proscribed 
     without need for proof of an underlying improper motive. 
     National Labor Relations Board v. Brown, supra, 380 
     U.S., at 287, 85 S.Ct. at 986, American Ship Building Co. 
     v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 380 U.S. at 
     
     311, 85 S.Ct. at 963.  That is, some conduct carries with 
     it 'unavoidable consequences which the employer not only 
     foresaw but which he must have intended' and thus bears 
     'its own indicia of intent.'  National Labor Relations 
     Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, at 228, 231, 83 S.Ct. 
     at 1145-1147.  If the conduct in question falls within this 
     'inherently destructive' category, the employer has the 
     burden of explaining away, justifying or characterizing 
     'his actions as something different than they appear on 
     their face,' and if he fails, 'an unfair labor practice charge 
     is made out.'  Id., at 228, 83 S.Ct. at 1145.  And even if 
     the employer does come forward with counter explana-
     tions for his conduct in this situation, the Board may 
     nevertheless draw an inference of improper motive from 
     the conduct itself and exercise its duty to strike the 
     proper balance between the asserted business justifica-
     tions and the invasion of employee rights in light of the 
     Act and its policy.  Id., at 229, 83 S.Ct. at 1145.  On the 
     other hand, when 'the resulting harm to employee rights 
     is * * * comparatively slight, and a substantial and 
     legitimate business end is served, the employers' conduct 
     is prima facie lawful,' and an affirmative showing of 
     improper motivation must be made.  National Labor 
     Relations Board v. Brown, supra, 380 U.S. at 289, 85 
     S.Ct. at 987;  American Ship Building Co. v. National 
     Labor Relations Board, supra, 380 U.S. at 311-313, 85 
     S.Ct. at 963-964.
     
388 U.S. at 33-34.  Applying this framework, the Board found 
that the CIPS lockout did not violate section 8(a)(3).

     The Board first concluded that "the lockout in the instant 
case, standing alone, cannot be considered inherently destruc-
tive of employee rights," based on the Supreme Court's 
holding in American Ship Bldg. that "a lockout for the 
purpose of applying pressure on a union during a bargaining 
dispute is not 'one of those acts which are demonstrably so 
destructive of collective bargaining that the Board need not 
inquire into employer motivation.' "  CIPS, slip op. at 3, 1998 
WL 600788, at *4 (quoting American Ship Bldg., 380 U.S. at 
309);  see also slip op. at 3, 1998 WL 600788, at *4 (noting 

even in Brown, where employer took "additional step of 
hiring temporary replacements after the lockout to continue 
operations," Supreme Court "found that such conduct is not 
inherently destructive of employee rights").  The Board 
therefore determined "to treat [the lockout] as having a 
'comparatively slight' impact on employee rights and apply 
the second Great Dane test to determine the lockout's legali-
ty."  CIPS, slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *5.  We agree 
with the Board's analysis.  The Supreme Court made it clear 
in American Ship Bldg., as the Board observed, that a 
lockout "does not fall into that category of cases arising under 
s 8(a)(3) in which the Board may truncate its inquiry into 
employer motivation."  380 U.S. at 312.1  Thus, the Board 

__________
     1 Local 702 contends the Board was required to "analyz[e] the 
specific facts in this case," in order to make the "inherently 
destructive" determination.  See Local 702 Brief at 39-44.  The 
Supreme Court decisions indicate, however, that an across-the-
board lockout "as a means to bring economic pressure to bear in 
support of the employer's bargaining position," 380 U.S. at 308, is 
categorically not "inherently destructive."  See American Ship 
Bldg., 380 U.S. at 310-12 ("Nor is the lockout one of those acts 
which are demonstrably so destructive of collective bargaining that 
the Board need not inquire into employer motivation, as might be 
the case, for example, if an employer permanently discharged his 
unionized staff and replaced them with employees known to be 
possessed of a violent antiunion animus....  This is not to deny 
that there are some practices which are inherently so prejudicial to 
union interests and so devoid of significant economic justification 
that no specific evidence of intent to discourage union membership 
or other antiunion animus is required.  In some cases, it may be 
that the employer's conduct carries with it an inference of unlawful 
intention so compelling that it is justifiable to disbelieve the employ-
er's protestations of innocent purpose....  But this lockout does 
not fall into that category of cases arising under s 8(a)(3) in which 
the Board may truncate its inquiry into employer motivation.");  
Brown, 380 U.S. at 284. ("[W]e do not see how the continued 
operations of respondents and their use of temporary replacements 
imply hostile motivation any more than the lockout itself;  nor do we 
see how they are inherently more destructive of employee rights.").  
Thus, the "specific facts" come into play only in the subsequent 

correctly concluded that under the Great Dane framework 
the Board must inquire "whether the Respondent possessed a 
legitimate and substantial business justification for the lock-
out."  CIPS, slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *5.  The Board 
reasonably found that CIPS had two such justifications.

     The first objective the Board attributed to CIPS was "to 
force the Unions to cease their inside game activities."  CIPS, 
slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *5.  Noting that the strike 
that prompted the lockout in Brown was "also an economic 
bargaining weapon in support of contract demands and no 
less protected than the inside game that the judge found was 
protected in this case," the Board concluded that the lockout 
was a legitimate defense against the Unions' "inside game 
weapon" deployed as part of "economic warfare in the midst 
of bargaining negotiations with the hope of securing agree-
ment on their terms for new contracts."  CIPS, slip op. at 4, 
1998 WL 600788, at *5.  Applying the standard of review set 
forth above, we find the Board's conclusion--that CIPS's 
defensive use of the lockout here against the Unions' inside 
game was as justified as the lockout in Brown aimed at the 
employees' economic strike--to be "reasonable, in light of the 
purposes of the Act and the controlling precedent of the 
Supreme Court," United Food, 880 F.2d at 1428.  According-
ly, we defer to the Board's policy choice.  Id.

     We also agree that the second business objective the Board 
identified--"resolution of issues that were dividing the parties 
in their bargaining negotiations," CIPS, slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 
600788, at *6--was a legitimate one and supported by the 
evidence.  The Board found as a fact that in implementing 
the lockout CIPS "sought resolution of issues that were 
dividing the parties in their bargaining negotiations," CIPS, 
slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *6, based on the text of 
letters CIPS's chief executive officer sent the members of 
each of the Unions on May 20, 1993, the day the lockout 
began.  The bulk of each letter outlined the contract conces-
sions CIPS made in its final offer and the chronology of 

__________
inquiries whether the particular lockout has a legitimate business 
justification and whether it was motivated by anti-union animus.

negotiations, culminating in the inside game.  In addition, the 
letter to Local 702 members stressed that union negotiators 
had continually rejected CIPS's urging to place its offers 
before the membership and was accompanied by an analysis 
of the differences between the previous contract and CIPS's 
final offer of a new one.2  The letters to Local 148 explained 
the Company's position on the one apparent sticking point in 
negotiations (the transfer of six union positions to manage-
ment).  Each letter closed with the following language:

     Like you, I am anxious to bring these issues to a 
     successful conclusion and have you back at your jobs at 
     the earliest possible date.  I sincerely regret the disrup-
     tion this decision will bring into your lives. My hope is 
     that this aspect of our labor dispute is short-lived.
     
App. 632-33, 644-48.  Given their focus and tenor (concen-
trating on the course and substance of negotiations and 
CIPS's eagerness to resolve the contract dispute), we con-
clude the letters constitute substantial evidence in support of 
the Board's finding "that a purpose of the lockout was to 
affect the outcome of negotiations between the Respondent 
and the Unions."  CIPS, slip op. at 5, 1998 WL 600788, at *7.  
We therefore uphold the Board's consequent determination 
"that application of economic pressure in support of this 
bargaining position constitutes a legitimate and substantial 
business justification for the lockout within the meaning of 
Great Dane."  CIPS, slip op. at 5, 1998 WL 600788, at *7.

     Finally, having found two substantial and legitimate busi-
ness objectives, the Board undertook the third inquiry of the 
Great Dane framework:  asking whether the Unions had 
made an "affirmative showing of improper motivation," such 
as through "evidence indicating that the lockout was intended 
to 'discourage union membership' or that was [sic] used 'in 
the service of designs inimical to the process of collective 
bargaining.' "  CIPS, slip op. at 6, 1998 WL 600788, at *9 
(quoting American Ship Bldg., 380 U.S. at 308, 312-313).  

__________
     2 According to the ALJ, a similar analysis was included with the 
letters to Local 148 members, CIPS, ALJ Dec. 23 [App. 806], but it 
does not appear in the appendix filed with the court.

The Board reasonably found "that 'not only is there absent in 
[sic] the record any independent evidence of improper motive, 
but the record contains positive evidence of the [Respon-
dent's] good faith.' "  CIPS, slip op. at 7, 1998 WL 600788, at 
*10 (quoting Brown, 380 U.S. at 290).  As examples of such 
evidence, the Board pointed to CIPS's long and stable bar-
gaining relationship with the Unions and its lengthy, good 
faith attempts to reach a contract here, including its clearly 
expressed desire in the May 20, 1993 letter to resolve differ-
ences and resume business as usual as soon as possible.  We 
conclude the Board's historic and continuing good faith deal-
ing with the Union, combined with the absence of affirmative 
evidence showing anti-union animus, sufficiently supports the 
Board's finding here.

     Despite the Board's faithful adherence to Great Dane and 
its predecessors and specific factual findings, the Unions 
challenge the Board's decision on two grounds:  (1) precedent 
precludes the Board's finding that CIPS's use of the lockout 
as an economic defense to the Unions' economic inside game 
weapon was in furtherance of a permissible business interest 
and (2) the finding of no anti-union animus on CIPS's part is 
belied by the record.  We find neither argument a basis for 
overturning the Board's determination.

     First, the Unions contend the Board's acceptance of the 
economic defense justification is contrary to Supreme Court 
precedent which, the Unions maintain, requires finding the 
lockout unlawful because it was intended to curtail "protect-
ed" activity, namely the inside game tactics.  As the Board 
correctly observed, however, that activity may be protected 
does not insulate it from counteraction by an employer.  
CIPS, slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *5 (noting:  "To hold 
that it is not a legitimate business justification for the Re-
spondent to defend against this weapon with a lockout in 
order to force the Unions to yield, ignores the Court's obser-
vation in American Ship that the 'right to bargain collectively 
does not entail any "right" to insist on one's position free 
from economic disadvantage.' ") (quoting 380 U.S. at 309);  see 
Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 
427 U.S. 132, 152-53 (1976) ("[E]ven were the activity pre-

sented in the instant case 'protected' activity within the 
meaning of s 7, economic weapons were available to counter 
the Union's refusal to work overtime, e.g., a lockout....") 
(citing American Ship Bldg.) (footnote omitted).  The strikes 
in both American Ship Bldg. and Brown, as the Board noted, 
were also protected activities--yet the employers' responsive 
lockouts in those cases were upheld by the Supreme Court.  
We see no reason to treat differently the lockout here which 
was implemented in response to the inside game strategy that 
the Unions adopted as an alternative to a strike.

     We also believe the Board's endorsement of the economic 
defense justification is, contrary to the Unions' insistence, 
consistent with its own precedent.  The Unions rely most 
heavily here on the Board's decisions in Riverside Cement 
Co., 296 N.L.R.B. 840 (1989), Thrift Drug Co, 204 N.L.R.B. 41 
(1973), and Carlson Roofing, 245 N.L.R.B. 13 (1979).  The 
Board reasonably distinguished Riverside on the ground that 
the action taken there was not in furtherance of "lawful 
bargaining" but was an attempt to implement "a unilateral 
change in the employees' contractual terms of employment" 
by requiring employees to furnish specific personal tools 
which, under their collective bargaining agreement, they were 
expressly exempted from furnishing.  CIPS, slip op. at 6-7 
n.20, 1998 WL 600788, at *15 n.20.  Any worker who did not 
provide his own tools was locked out.  In finding a section 
8(a)(3) violation, the Riverside Board stressed that the "denial 
of work was limited to only those employees who engaged in 
action they were entitled to take under the contract" and 
therefore "was not a lawful lockout," which is "generally 
permissible in anticipation of a strike or in support of an 
employer's legitimate bargaining position."  296 N.L.R.B. at 
841.  Similarly, in Thrift Drug Co., the Board found a section 
8(a)(3) violation where the employer suspended a single pick-
eting employee solely on the ground the employee "was 
unlawfully selected for suspension because of her activities on 
behalf of the Union."  204 N.L.R.B. at 41.  In contrast to 
Riverside and Thrift Drug, the lockout here was directed 
unit-wide, not to specific employees engaged in specific acts.  
Finally, Carlson Roofing is inapposite because the Board's 

finding that the lockout there violated section 8(a)(3) was 
overturned on review by the Seventh Circuit.  See Carlson 
Roofing Co. v. NLRB, 627 F.2d 77, 82 (7th Cir. 1980).

     The Unions also argue that the Board ignored the ALJ's 
credibility determinations and findings regarding the true 
motive behind the lockout.  The Board, however, expressly 
accepted the ALJ's finding that the lockout was implemented 
"in reprisal" for the inside game, ALJ Decision at 22, 1998 
WL 600788, at *35, CIPS, slip op. at 2, 1998 WL 600788, at 
*2, but then found the motive was "not ... impermissible," 
CIPS, slip op. at 4, 1998 WL 600788, at *5.  The ALJ based 
his motive finding on statements by company management 
that it would have "preferred" and been "better off with" a 
strike or lockout than with the inside game strategy, under 
which unit employees "were getting the best of both worlds" 
by "putting pressure on the Company while still getting their 
paycheck for the daytime work."  ALJ Dec. at 65 [App. 848].  
Neither this testimony nor the finding itself is at odds with 
the Board's finding that CIPS implemented the lockout as an 
economic response to the inside game, which CIPS viewed as 
economically injurious.  The Board's principal factual dispute 
with the ALJ was on how to construe the text of the May 20, 
1993 letters and the Board decision sufficiently explains its 
differing, and we believe more defensible, interpretation of 
the letters' language.  See Mathews Readymix, Inc. v. 
NLRB, 165 F.3d 74, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("Board's findings of 
fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence," 
provided it "make clear the basis of its disagreement" when 
reversing ALJ) (citing Avecor, Inc. v. NLRB, 931 F.2d 924, 
928 (D.C. Cir. 1991);  United Food & Commercial Workers 
Int'l Union, Local 152 v. NLRB, 768 F.2d 1463, 1470 (D.C. 
Cir. 1985)).

     Finally, Local 128 challenges the Board's finding that its 
members were locked out in order to obtain a contract on the 
ground that agreement on a contract with Local 128 (as 
distinct from Local 702) was imminent.  We accept the 
Board's finding as supported by the facts.  The record estab-
lishes that Local 128 acted in unison with Local 207 in 
planning and implementing the inside game and that, even 

after CIPS terminated the lockout of Local 128, its members 
stayed away from work in support of Local 702 (as they might 
well have done ab initio if CIPS had not locked them out).  It 
was therefore not unreasonable for CIPS and the Board to 
treat the two locals as a single bargaining force.  In fact, 
given the unified actions of the two locals, lockout of only one 
might well have suggested unlawful discrimination under the 
Board's decisions in Riverside and Thrift Drug.  See supra p. 
12.
