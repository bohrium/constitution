     Before:  Edwards, Williams and Sentelle, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  Plaintiff-appellants Monmouth 
Medical Center and Staten Island University Hospital are 
acute-care facilities that receive payments under Medicare 
Part A for services to Medicare beneficiaries.  Since 1983, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services has made payments 
to cover hospital operating costs for inpatient care under the 
Prospective Payment System ("PPS"), which reimburses ac-
cording to a uniform national rate schedule.  See 42 U.S.C. 
s 1395ww(d).  The two hospitals, because they serve a dis-
proportionate share of low-income Medicare recipients, are 
eligible for "disproportionate share hospital" ("DSH") adjust-
ments to their PPS payments.  See 42 U.S.C. 
s 1395ww(d)(5)(F).  Monmouth and Staten Island sought the 
aid of the district court in an attempt to have their fiscal year 
("FY") 1993 and FY 1994 DSH payments recalculated, assert-
ing jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. s 1395oo(a)(1)(a), 28 U.S.C. 
s 1331, and 28 U.S.C. s 1361.  The district court decided that 
the hospitals failed to follow the statutorily mandated proce-
dure for appealing their payments, that 42 U.S.C. s 1395ii 
precluded other review, and that, accordingly, it lacked sub-
ject matter jurisdiction.  We reverse.

                             *  *  *

     The Secretary of HHS has delegated authority to adminis-
ter the Medicare Act to the Health Care Financing Adminis-
tration ("HCFA").1  Determinations of payment amounts are 
in turn often delegated to fiscal intermediaries, generally 

__________
     1 HCFA was recently renamed and became the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services.  We will continue to use the desig-
nation HCFA in this opinion to maintain consistency with the 
record below.

private insurers that manage the payments for the Secretary.  
See 42 U.S.C. s 1395h.  Estimated payments are made peri-
odically and an annual accounting is done by the intermediary 
in the form of a Notice of Provider Reimbursement ("NPR") 
based on a cost report submitted by the provider after the 
close of each fiscal year.

     The Medicare Act has detailed instructions on the proce-
dures for seeking review of payment determinations.  Under 
42 U.S.C. s 1395oo(a)(1)(A) a dissatisfied provider may ap-
peal two types of "final determinations" to the Provider 
Reimbursement Review Board ("Board").  Clause (i) covers a 
fiscal intermediary's final reimbursement decision, commonly 
the NPR, and clause (ii) covers a final determination of the 
Secretary regarding payments under 42 U.S.C. ss 1395ww(b) 
or (d), including the DSH payments.  Appeals are to be filed 
within 180 days of notice of the final determination.  Id. 
s 1395oo(a)(3).  In either case, the decision of the Board is 
then reviewable by filing in district court within 60 days of 
notice of the decision, or by the Secretary's own motion.  Id. 
s 1395oo(f).  Section 1395ii generally forecloses other ave-
nues of review by incorporating the review-limiting provision 
of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. s 405(h):

     The findings and decision of the [Secretary of HHS] 
     after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who 
     were parties to such hearing.  No findings of fact or 
     decision of the [Secretary of HHS] shall be reviewed by 
     any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as 
     herein provided.  No action against the United States, 
     the [Secretary of HHS], or any officer or employee 
     thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of 
     title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this sub-
     chapter.
     
42 U.S.C. s 405(h).

     The Secretary's regulations provide three additional chan-
nels of administrative review.  Under 42 CFR s 405.1841(b), 
a late-filed request for Board review may be considered by 
the Board, provided that good cause is shown and the request 
is filed no more than three years after the NPR.  The 

regulations also provide two possibilities for the reopening of 
a determination, again with a three-year limit.  42 CFR 
s 405.1885(a) provides for reopening, at the discretion of the 
decisionmaker, on the motion of the provider.  Subsection (b) 
of that same regulation, which ultimately controls here, man-
dates reopening in one special circumstance.  It directs that 
the decision

     shall be reopened and revised by the intermediary if ... 
     the [HCFA] notifies the intermediary that such determi-
     nation or decision is inconsistent with the applicable law, 
     regulations, or general instructions issued by the 
     [HCFA].
     
42 CFR s 405.1885(b) (emphasis added).

     Under the statute authorizing DSH adjustments, eligibility 
for and calculation of the payment require the summing of 
two fractions.  The numerator of one of these fractions calls 
for the number of inpatient days of patients who "were 
eligible for medical assistance under a State plan [i.e., Medic-
aid]."  42 U.S.C. s 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(II) (emphasis added).  
The Secretary promulgated a regulation on how to make the 
calculation and has repeatedly amended it.  See 42 CFR 
s 412.106 (1993) (version in force when original DSH calcula-
tions were made).  At the same time, the Secretary published 
an interpretation of that rule in the Federal Register as part 
of the notice and comment rulemaking implementing the PPS.  
See 51 Fed. Reg. 16,772, 16,777 (May 6, 1986);  51 Fed. Reg. 
31,454, 31,460 (September 3, 1986).  Reading "who were 
eligible" as " 'who (for such days) were eligible' " the Secre-
tary declared that "Medicaid covered days will include only 
those days for which benefits are payable."  51 Fed. Reg. at 
16,777/2-3 (emphasis added).  This interpretation had the 
effect of reducing payments by limiting adjustments for pa-
tients who were "eligible" for Medicaid benefits under the 
natural reading of the word, but who, because of a particular 
state's program, were not receiving such benefits on a given 
day.

     Neither hospital timely availed itself of the right to appeal 
the NPRs in question.  But other providers did.  The Secre-

tary's interpretation fared poorly, being struck down in four 
of our sister circuits.  See Cabell Huntington Hosp. v. Shala-
la, 101 F.3d 984 (4th Cir. 1996);  Legacy Emanuel Hosp. & 
Health Ctr. v. Shalala, 97 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir. 1996);  Deacon-
ess Health Serv. Corp. v. Shalala, 83 F.3d 1041 (8th Cir. 
1996);  Jewish Hosp., Inc. v. Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, 19 F.3d 270 (6th Cir. 1994).  In light of these 
decisions, the Administrator of HCFA issued a ruling that 
rescinded the Secretary's challenged interpretation nation-
wide.  See Health Care Financing Administration Ruling 
97-2 (February 27, 1997) ("HCFAR 97-2").  The ruling es-
tablished a new interpretation more favorable to hospitals, 
providing that Medicaid-eligible days would be counted 
"whether or not the hospital received payment for those 
inpatient hospital services."  Id.  The new interpretation was 
to be effective in the month of its publication and applied to 
all as yet unsettled cost reports and all cases in which 
"jurisdictionally proper" appeals were still pending.  See id.  
The ruling explicitly foreclosed retrospective application:  
"We will not reopen settled cost reports based on this issue."  
Id.  Like all such rulings, HCFAR 97-2 was issued without 
notice or opportunity for comment.

     The hospitals nonetheless sought recalculation of their 
DSH payments, filing with their intermediaries for reopening 
well within the three years required by s 405.1885.  Their 
respective intermediaries denied the requests, citing HCFAR 
97-2.  Both hospitals also sought Board review in attempts to 
satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of 42 U.S.C. s 1395oo.  
They filed their appeals within 180 days of the publication of 
HCFAR 97-2, but the intermediaries objected that the trig-
ger event was each hospital's NPR, not HCFAR 97-2.  In 
response, the hospitals invoked s 405.1841(b), which allows 
extension of the time limit for "good cause."  They argued 
that the delay was unavoidable because they could not have 
anticipated HCFAR 97-2's refusal to grant reopening.  In 
separate letters to the providers, the Board stated that "your 
rationale for late filing does not constitute good cause" and 
that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeals.  Both hospitals 
sought review in the district court.  We review the district 

court's jurisdictional determination de novo.  See Moore v. 
Valder, 65 F.3d 189, 196 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  Although we 
eventually conclude that we have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. 
s 1361, we must first examine all other possible avenues of 
relief to ensure that the hospitals have fully exhausted those 
which were available.

                             *  *  *

     The hospitals first invoke the jurisdiction of the district 
court under 42 U.S.C. s 1395oo(f) to review the Board's 
denial of their appeals.  Having acknowledged that their 
appeals were untimely with respect to the NPRs, they frame 
the appeals here as challenges to the reopening prohibition in 
HCFAR 97-2.  At issue is whether the Board could properly 
consider such an attack.  As noted above, clause (i) of 
s 1395oo(a)(1)(A), the prerequisite for district court jurisdic-
tion under s 1395oo(f), gives the Board jurisdiction to review 
final reimbursement determinations by intermediaries.  But 
it appears that neither of the hospitals attacked its intermedi-
ary's non-reopening decision in its appeal to the Board, and 
an HCFA Ruling is not the action of an intermediary.  Staten 
Island did not even request reopening until three months 
after it sought Board review.  And Monmouth, while it tried 
for reopening before making its appeal to the board, made 
absolutely no mention of its intermediary or its reopening 
request in its appeal to the Board.

     Clause (ii), which applies to final determinations of the 
Secretary regarding a provider's PPS calculations, brings 
jurisdiction no nearer.  In Washington Hosp. Center v. Bow-
en, 795 F.2d 139 (D.C. Cir. 1986), we determined that a pre-
NPR challenge could be brought where the Secretary had 
firmly established "the only variable factor in the final deter-
mination as to the amount of payment under s 1395ww(d)." 
Id. at 147.  There the Secretary had determined the individu-
al hospitals' "target amount," the erstwhile variable factor, 
thereby fixing their payment amounts under the PPS.  Even 
after concluding, as we do below, that HCFAR 97-2 triggered 
mandatory reopening under s 405.1885(b), we fail to see how 
an attempt by the Secretary to establish a general policy 
against reopening in any way resembles a final determination 

"as to the amount of payment," the only kind of determina-
tion for which clause (ii) creates a right of appeal to the 
Board.  The hospitals argue that the blanket application of 
the ruling is irrelevant, because it directly affects their claims 
specifically.  That may be true, but the ruling does not itself 
either establish or alter their "disproportionate patient per-
centage" or the amount of payment they receive under PPS.

     Our conclusion that the hospitals' appeals to the Board fit 
neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) is at least consistent with, if 
not required by, the Supreme Court's recent opinion in Your 
Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v. Shalala, 525 U.S. 449 
(1999).  In that case, the Court reviewed a discretionary 
decision under s 405.1885(a) not to reopen a clause (i) deter-
mination, finding that such a refusal did not itself qualify as a 
clause (i) determination.  It relied on Califano v. Sanders, 
430 U.S. 99 (1977), in which it held that judicial review is not 
available for the Secretary's decision not to reopen a claim for 
benefits under the Social Security Act.  Sanders, the Court 
pointed out, relied in turn on two factors:  "that the opportu-
nity to reopen a benefit adjudication was afforded only by 
regulation and not by the Social Security Act itself;  and that 
judicial review of a reopening denial would frustrate the 
statutory purpose of imposing a 60-day limit on judicial 
review of the Secretary's final decision."  Your Home, 525 
U.S. at 454.  The Your Home Court also concluded that the 
absence of Board review would not deprive petitioners there 
of a suitable opportunity for " 'retroactive corrective adjust-
ment[ ]' " because they had an initial opportunity to appeal 
their NPRs, plus a chance to secure discretionary reopening 
by the intermediary.  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. 
s 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii)).

     One might argue that where a provider is seeking reopen-
ing under s 405.1885(b), the Sanders concern about the finali-
ty of decision is lessened, inasmuch as such cases will be 
relatively few in number;  they arise only if the HCFA 
informs intermediaries that a prior decision or set of decisions 
is inconsistent with applicable law.  But it would still remain 

unclear how this distinction would change the character of the 
reopening decision itself from "not a final determination" to 
"final determination."  And of course it should make no 
difference if the analysis arises out of clause (i) or clause (ii).  
In any event, we reserve our own final determination on this 
issue for a case in which it is more clearly presented;  here 
HCFAR 97-2 can in no way be mistaken for a final determi-
nation for the purposes of judicial review under ss 1395oo(a) 
& (f).

     The hospitals nonetheless argue that our opinion in Wash-
ington Hospital Center and the HCFA's application of it in 
National Medical Enterprises Malpractice PPS Group Ap-
peal, Case No. 87-5050G, HCFA Adm. Dec. (Oct. 5, 1988), 
together compel the interpretation that clause (ii) creates a 
right to Board review 180 days after the "issuance, modifica-
tion, or invalidation of a HCFAR."  App. Open. Br. at 48.  
They do no such thing.  Washington Hospital Center held 
invalid HCFAR 84-1, which had barred appeal of PPS deter-
minations until after an NPR was issued.  Providers in 
National Medical Enterprises sought Board review for their 
payments in the wake of that case, but submitted their appeal 
more than 180 days from the issuance of our decision.  The 
Administrator's decision did indeed suggest that a more 
timely appeal would have been successful, but that conclusion 
was dependent on the peculiar operation of HCFAR 84-1, 
which had previously operated as a bar on properly filed 
appeals of right.  See National Medical Enterprises at 3.  In 
the absence of HCFAR 97-2 the hospitals would not have had 
recourse to the Board, as they have already acknowledged.

     The hospitals next seek jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. s 1331 
for review of the reopening preclusion in HCFAR 97-2.  Such 
review could not be more plainly off limits under 42 U.S.C. 
s 405(h), which explicitly withholds s 1331 jurisdiction for 
"any claim arising under this title."  The Supreme Court has 
consistently interpreted this phrase broadly, such that juris-
diction is barred when " 'both the standing and the substan-
tive basis for the presentation' of the claims" is the Medicare 
Act.  Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 615 (1984) (quoting 
Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 760-61 (1975)).  Thus, in 

Ringer, the Court declared that plaintiffs seeking to overturn 
an HCFA ruling that would limit their recovery for a particu-
lar type of surgery could do so only in the context of the 
statutorily authorized process for review.  This applied with 
equal force to the plaintiff who had not yet undergone the 
surgery and therefore had, as yet, no claim for reimburse-
ment.  See id. at 620.  That the plaintiffs there were not 
seeking a specific monetary award was irrelevant.  The ulti-
mate goal for those plaintiffs, as for the hospitals here, was 
the recovery of additional sums under the Medicare Act.  See 
id. at 615-16.

     The hospitals make a plausible argument that jurisdiction 
may be had under the limited exception to s 405(h) carved 
out by Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 
476 U.S. 667 (1986), as interpreted by Shalala v. Illinois 
Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1 (2000).  In 
Michigan Academy the Court, concluding that Congress had 
incorporated s 405(h) mutatis mutandis into the Medicare 
Act, allowed a challenge to certain Medicare procedural regu-
lations, reading s 405(h) as limiting review of determinations 
but not of "the Secretary's instructions and regulations."  476 
U.S. at 680.  Illinois Council, however, clarified "Michigan 
Academy as holding that s 1395ii does not apply s 405(h) 
where application of s 405(h) would not simply channel re-
view through the agency, but would mean no review at all."  
529 U.S. at 19.  The hospitals here argue that, because they 
no longer have jurisdictionally valid claims before the Board 
and because HCFAR 97-2 would not in any event apply to 
them if they did, they will never have the opportunity to 
challenge that ruling.  That seems like a plausible outcome.  
But despite the intermediaries' reliance on HCFAR 97-2, the 
ruling is separate from their denials of reopening, and under 
the Secretary's regulations, only the intermediaries have the 
jurisdiction to reopen.  42 C.F.R s 405.1885(c).  Jurisdiction 
to review the ruling would do nothing to provide jurisdiction 
over the intermediaries' denials, which would stand un-
changed and no longer susceptible to automatic reopening, 
given the expiration of the three-year period for reopenings 
under s 405.1885(b).

     The hospitals lastly seek mandamus jurisdiction under 28 
U.S.C. s 1361 and relief ordering the intermediaries to re-
open their determinations.  The Supreme Court has on sever-
al occasions expressly reserved the question of whether 
s 1361 jurisdiction is precluded by s 405(h).  See Your 
Home, 525 U.S. at 456-57 n.3;  Ringer, 466 U.S. at 616-17.  
But this court has previously determined that s 1361 jurisdic-
tion is not barred, see Ganem v. Heckler, 746 F.2d 844, 850-
52 (D.C. Cir. 1984), joining the virtual unanimity of circuit 
courts.  See, e.g., Burnett v. Bowen, 830 F.2d 731, 737-38 
(7th Cir. 1987);  Belles v. Schweiker, 720 F.2d 509, 511-13 (8th 
Cir. 1983).  Of course, to maintain an action under s 1361, a 
plaintiff must both exhaust available remedies and show a 
clear non-discretionary duty.  Ringer, 466 U.S. at 616-17.

     Neither party questions our ability to provide relief in the 
absence of the intermediaries as parties to this lawsuit, but 
we note that their non-joinder does not undermine our juris-
diction.  The intermediaries are agents of the Secretary 
charged with the relevant duties under the Medicare Act and 
its regulations, and, as such, they may properly be bound by a 
writ of mandamus against the Secretary.  See United States 
ex rel. Rahman v. Oncology Associates, 198 F.3d 502, 511 
(4th Cir. 1999);  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d).

     The hospitals argue that 42 CFR s 405.1885(b) was trig-
gered by HCFAR 97-2 and that the intermediaries therefore 
had a non-discretionary duty to reopen their determinations.  
The Secretary responds that the choice of whether or not to 
advise providers that a regulation is "inconsistent with the 
applicable law" is committed to the non-reviewable discretion 
of the Secretary.  But the issue is not whether we may 
review the choice to advise or not advise as to consistency 
with applicable law;  it is whether the Secretary, acting 
through the HCFA Administrator, in effect announced a 
finding of inconsistency (even while purporting to veto re-
opening).

     To be sure, HCFAR 97-2 studiously avoided using the 
magic words "inconsistent with the applicable law," and in-

stead called the earlier interpretation "contrary to the appli-
cable law in four judicial circuits."  HCFAR 97-2.  The 
Secretary argues that HCFAR 97-2 merely "acquiesced pro-
spectively," in the interests of national uniformity, without 
actually admitting its illegality.  But HCFAR 97-2 also pur-
ports to change an existing interpretation, and under the law 
of this circuit altering an interpretive rule (interpreting an 
agency regulation) requires notice and opportunity for com-
ment unless, of course, the original interpretation was invalid 
and therefore a nullity (as discussed below).

     The Medicare Act places notice and comment requirements 
on the Secretary's substantive rulemaking similar to those 
created by the APA.  See 42 U.S.C. s 1395hh(b);  5 U.S.C. 
s 553(b).  We have not had an opportunity to decide whether 
the Medicare Act requirement of notice and comment for 
"changes [of] a substantive legal standard" creates a more 
stringent obligation than the APA or whether it somehow 
changes the dividing line between legislative and interpretive 
rules.2  But it seems fair to infer that, as the Medicare Act 
was drafted after the APA, s 1385hh(c)'s reference to "inter-
pretive rules" without any further definition adopted an ex-
emption at least similar in scope to that of the APA.  See 
Warder v. Shalala, 149 F.3d 73, 79 n.4 (1st Cir. 1998).  We 
see no reason to explore the possibility of a distinction here, 
as HCFAR 97-2 appears to have none of the indicia that 
would lead us to think it a legislative rule under the APA.  
See, generally, American Mining Congress v. Mine Safety & 
Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1108-12 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  In 
the absence of HCFAR 97-2 or its predecessor interpreta-
tion, there would still be an "adequate legislative basis for ... 
agency action."  Id. at 1112.  The definition of eligible inpa-
tient days is merely an "elucidation of rights and duties 
created by Congress" and the Secretary's legislative rule.  

__________
     2 Although no explicit exception to those requirements is made for 
"interpretive rules," an exception is implicit in the provision for 
periodic publication for such rules, see 42 U.S.C. s 1395hh(c), and 
courts generally have assumed the exception.  See Health Ins. 
Ass'n of America, Inc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412, 422-23 (D.C. Cir. 
1994).

Health Ins. Ass'n of America, Inc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412, 
423 (citing American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1109-10).

     But characterization as an interpretive rule does not relieve 
the Secretary of notice and comment requirements when a 
valid interpretation exists.  In Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-
ica v. D.C. Arena L.P., 117 F.3d 579, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1997), we 
concluded that:  "Once an agency gives its regulation an 
interpretation, it can only change that interpretation as it 
would formally modify the regulation itself:  through the 
process of notice and comment rulemaking."  See also Alaska 
Professional Hunters Ass'n v. Federal Aviation Administra-
tion, 177 F.3d 1030, 1033-34 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  Shell Offshore 
Inc. v. Babbitt, 238 F.3d 622, 629 (5th Cir. 2001).  Here, a 
valid rule interpreting a regulation was clearly in play, and it 
was modified by HCFAR 97-2.

     The new interpretation established by HCFAR 97-2 would 
therefore be unlawful absent notice and comment rulemaking, 
unless the original interpretation was itself invalid.  See 
Dixon v. United States, 381 U.S. 68, 74 (1965) ("A regulation 
which ... operates to create a rule out of harmony with the 
statute, is a mere nullity.") (internal citations omitted).  As a 
general rule, it is for the courts to determine whether or not a 
regulation is invalid.  But as four circuits had already done 
so, it certainly can't have been improper for the Secretary to 
concede the invalidity nationally.  See Independent Petrole-
um Ass'n of America v. Babbitt, 92 F.3d 1248, 1260 n.3 (D.C. 
Cir. 1996).

     Concluding that the Secretary did in fact give notice of the 
interpretation's inconsistency with applicable law, we also find 
that s 405.1885(b) imposed a clear duty on intermediaries to 
reopen DSH payment determinations for the hospitals.  The 
portion of HCFAR 97-2 that conflicts with that duty is simply 
a nullity.  In addition, we think it insignificant that, because 
of the Secretary's own three year limitation, reopening would 
not be available if sought today.  Although mandamamus is 
classified as a legal remedy, its issuance is largely controlled 
by equitable principles.  See Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, 
245 U.S. 308, 312 (1917).  Since both hospitals were within 

the three-year mark when they made their requests for 
reopening, they are entitled to the reopening that was due 
them at that time.  Cf. Burnett v. Bowen, 830 F.2d 731, 736-
41 & n.7 (7th Cir. 1987).

     The Secretary argues that the hospitals have failed to 
exhaust their remedies, because they failed to file proper 
appeals of their NPRs under s 1395oo(a).  But that fact is 
hardly relevant here.  The question is whether they have 
done all they can to vindicate their right to reopening.  We 
have already shown above how all other avenues of relief are 
either foreclosed or futile.

     Finally, the Secretary half-heartedly suggests that the 
hospitals may have waived mandamus jurisdiction by failing 
to specify s 1361 as one of the bases for jurisdiction until 
their response to the Secretary's motion to dismiss.  But the 
Secretary does not contend (apart from the arguments reject-
ed above) that the hospitals failed to allege sufficient facts to 
support their mandamus claim, the essential test for legal 
sufficiency.  See Richardson v. U.S., 193 F.3d 545, 549 (D.C. 
Cir. 1999).  Nor does the Secretary argue that the govern-
ment was in any way prejudiced by the trustees' failure to list 
s 1361 in their complaints.  The government has at best 
identified a procedural failing that would easily have been 
remedied by a request to amend the complaints that in no 
way affects our authority to consider issuance of a writ.  See 
Caribbean Broadcasting System, Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless 
P.L.C., 148 F.3d 1080, 1083-84 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Fed R. Civ. 
P. 15(a).  Indeed courts can treat certain requests for manda-
tory injunctions as petitions for a writ of mandamus, see, e.g., 
National Wildlife Federation v. U.S., 626 F.2d 917, 918 n.1 
(D.C. Cir. 1980), and habeas petitions as ones for mandamus, 
see, e.g., United States ex rel. Schonbrun v. Commanding 
Officer, 403 F.2d 371, 374 (2d Cir. 1968);  Long v. Parker, 390 
F.2d 816, 818-819 (3d Cir. 1968).

     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed 
and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.

                                                                  So ordered.
