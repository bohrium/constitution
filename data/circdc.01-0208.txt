     Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge 
Williams.

     Williams, Senior Circuit Judge:  In 1994 the Federal Com-
munications Commission auctioned off a group of Interactive 
Video and Data Service ("IVDS") licenses.  In 1997 it 
changed the rules governing grace periods for winning bid-
ders who made late installment payments.  Celtronix, a win-
ning bidder for such a license, alleges that the change was 
unlawfully retroactive.  We affirm the Commission's decision.

                             *  *  *

     In a June 1994 auction Celtronix (then known as Communi-
ty Teleplay, Inc.) won an IVDS license for the Norfolk-
Virginia Beach Metropolitan Service Area.  As a small busi-
ness, Celtronix was allowed to pay its winning bid in install-
ments over the term of the license.  47 C.F.R. s 1.2110(d) 
(1994).  The regulation provided that any payment would be 
in default after 90 days delinquency, but allowed a licensee to 
request a three-to-six-month grace period.  Id. 
s 1.2110(d)(4)(i), (ii).  In considering whether to grant the 
grace period, the Commission could consider the licensee's 
payment history, the reasons for default, the licensee's finan-
cial condition, and other circumstances.  Id.  Though its 
regulations were not exactly clear on the availability of addi-
tional grace periods, the Commission issued a public notice 
claiming discretion to "extend or grant additional grace peri-
ods where circumstances warrant."  Public Notice, "Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau Staff Clarifies 'Grace Period' 
Rule for IVDS 'Auction' Licensees Paying By Installment 
Payments," 10 FCC Rcd 10724 (1995).

     In 1997 the Commission changed its grace period rule in 
the Third Report and Order and Second Further Notice of 
Proposed Rule Making, 13 FCC Rcd 374 (1997) ("Grace 

Period Order").  Under the new regulation, a licensee who 
missed a payment would automatically have 90 extra days to 
do so without being considered delinquent.  47 C.F.R. 
s 1.2110(f)(4)(i) (1998).  This came at the price of a 5% late 
fee on the amount past due.  Id.  Failure to make payment at 
the end of the first 90-day period would result in a second 
automatic 90-day grace period and a 10% late fee.  Id. 
s 1.2110(f)(4)(ii). (Formerly, there had been an interest 
charge, amortized over the term of the license.)  Any licensee 
failing to make payment after 180 days delinquency (or failing 
to pay the late fee) would then be in default.  Id. 
s 1.2110(f)(4)(iii), (iv).1

     Celtronix filed a petition for reconsideration of the Grace 
Period Order in January 1998 and, in July of that year, an 
emergency motion for stay pending review of the petition.  
But in September 1998, just before the final date on which 
Celtronix's license would have been permanently defaulted, 
the Commission announced a notice of a proposed rulemaking 
aimed at introducing new flexibility for spectrum occupied by 
IVDS licensees;  to reflect the change it immediately redesig-
nated the service as the "218-219 Mhz Service."  Amendment 
of Part 95 of the Commission's Rules to Provide Regulatory 
Flexibility in the 218-219 MHz Service, Order, Memorandum 
Opinion and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 13 
FCC Rcd 19064 p 16 (1998).  For the duration of that rule-
making the Commission suspended all installment payments 
for licensees who were paid up through March 16, 1998 or had 
properly filed grace period requests.  Id. p 13.

     In its final order on the 218-219 Mhz Service, Amendment 
of Part 95 of the Commission's Rules to Provide Regulatory 
Flexibility in the 218-219 MHz Service, Report and Order 
and Memorandum Opinion and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 1497 
(1999) ("218-219 MHz Service Order"), the Commission dis-
missed Celtronix's grace period requests and its emergency 
stay motion, saying that parties that had properly filed grace 

__________
     1  The current version of the rule provides that the grace period 
shall be a quarter year, rather than 90 days, but is otherwise similar 
in substance.  47 C.F.R. s 1.2110(g)(4)(i) (2000).

period requests had already received "an extended grace 
period."  Id. p p 45, 133.  It also provided three options for 
licensees in Celtronix's situation:  (1) reamortization and the 
resumption of installment payments;  (2) amnesty, under 
which the licensee could return the license, have its debt 
forgiven, and receive a partial refund of prior payments;  and 
(3) prepayment of the entire amount.  Id. p 34.  Additionally, 
the Commission provided that the former 5-year term would 
be extended to 10 years.  Id. p p 25-32.

     Celtronix sought reconsideration of the 218-219 MHz Ser-
vice Order in December 1999.  While that was pending, the 
Commission denied Celtronix's petition for reconsideration of 
the Grace Period Order.  Amendment of Part 1 of the 
Commission's Rules--Competitive Bidding Procedures, Order 
on Reconsideration of the Third Report and Order, Fifth 
Report and Order, and Fourth Further Notice of Proposed 
Rule Making, 15 FCC Rcd 15293, p 27 (2000).  Then, in 
December 2000, the Commission denied reconsideration of 
the 218-219 MHz Service Order, and reaffirmed that IVDS 
licensees must decide among the three options of amnesty, 
resuming repayment, or prepayment of the entire amount.  
See Amendment of Part 95 of the Commission's Rules to 
Provide Regulatory Flexibility in the 218-219 MHz Service, 
Second Order on Reconsideration, 15 FCC Rcd 25020, p p 1, 
34 (2000).  It rejected Celtronix's proposal of a fourth option 
under which licensees could disaggregate, i.e., could retain 
part of their 218-219 Mhz spectrum for a given market and 
return the rest to the Commission.  Id. at p p 14-20.

     Celtronix chose to return the license to the Commission for 
amnesty, subject to its claim for a disaggregation alternative.  
It filed a petition for reconsideration of this order, which is 
still pending before the Commission.

     As to the Grace Period Order, Celtronix filed a petition for 
review under s 402(a) of the Communications Act (No. 00-
1401) and an appeal under s 402(b) (No. 00-1400).  Since 
these jurisdictional provisions are mutually exclusive, see 
Freeman Engineering Associates, Inc. v. FCC, 103 F.3d 169, 

177 (D.C. Cir. 1997), and because Celtronix's case falls into 
none of the categories in s 402(b)(1) through (8), we dismiss 
appeal No. 00-1400 and take jurisdiction for No. 00-1401 
under s 402(a).

     There is another jurisdictional concern.  Given Celtronix's 
election of amnesty in the event that its disaggregation 
proposal does not prevail (either by Commission change of 
heart or by judicial reversal of the Commission), there is a 
distinct chance that Celtronix would not benefit from a victo-
ry here;  absent disaggregation, it would simply take its 
amnesty and depart.  But we do not see this possibility as 
impairing its standing.  Compare a standard two-issue case:  
If a plaintiff presents two or more alternative grounds as 
routes to its hoped-for ultimate victory, a court does not lose 
jurisdiction over the second claim once it has ruled in the 
plaintiff's favor on the first claim;  victory on the first claim 
doesn't moot the second.  Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l v. UAL 
Corp., 897 F.2d 1394, 1397 (7th Cir. 1990).  Conversely, if a 
party must prevail on both of two theories to achieve a 
meaningful win (e.g., knock out a regulation), its loss on the 
first does not moot the second.  Worldcom, Inc. v. FCC, 246 
F.3d 690, 695 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  For both situations, the 
continued exercise of jurisdiction by the court is based on a 
practical consideration:  Disposition of both bases has the 
potential of achieving judicial economies, as higher-level re-
view might remove the first basis for the outcome.  See id.

     Just as the contingent character of the ruling on the second 
issue in the above cases does not spell mootness, so too the 
fact that here Celtronix's ultimate success may depend on the 
outcome of pending administrative litigation should not be 
seen as rendering the harm inflicted on it by the Commis-
sion's grace period decision too "conjectural" for purposes of 
standing.  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 
(1983).  Otherwise, a party requiring victory on two fronts in 
two fora could easily lose his chance for review on the first 
claim to be put forward for adjudication, see 28 U.S.C. s 2344 
(requiring petition for review to be filed within 60 days), thus 
destroying his chance of prevailing, regardless of the merits.

                             *  *  *

     Celtronix argues that the new grace period rule, 47 C.F.R. 
s 1.2110(g)(4), violates the Administrative Procedure Act, 
which limits "rules" to agency prescriptions of "future effect."  
5 U.S.C. s 551(4);  see Bowen v. Georgetown University 
Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 216-25 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring);  
Bergerco Canada v. U.S. Treasury Department, 129 F.3d 189, 
192-93 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (treating Justice Scalia's concurring 
opinion as substantially authoritative, though noting that 
"[t]he Bowen majority, to be sure, neither embraced nor 
rejected Justice Scalia's view").  To a large extent Celtronix 
invokes the criteria applied in Landgraf v. USI Film Prod-
ucts, 511 U.S. 244 (1994), a case that explored the question of 
what sort of retroactivity was subject to the longstanding 
presumption against retroactive statutes.  Id. at 263-80.  
Here, of course, there is no issue of intent at all:  the 
Commission indisputably intended its new grace period rule 
to apply to payment delays occurring after the rule's adoption 
but in connection with previously issued licenses.  Nonethe-
less, the tests formulated in Landgraf are indeed pertinent to 
the APA issue.  See, e.g., Bergerco Canada, 129 F.3d at 193;  
DIRECTV v. FCC, 110 F.3d 816, 825-26 (D.C. Cir. 1997).

     According to Justice Scalia, a retroactive rule forbidden by 
the APA is one which "alter[s] the past legal consequences of 
past actions."  Bowen, 488 U.S. at 219.  In Landgraf, the 
Court said that retroactivity occurred where a statute "would 
impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a 
party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with 
respect to transactions already completed."  511 U.S. at 280.

     It seems impossible to characterize the rule change here as 
"alter[ing] the past legal consequences" of a past action.  It 
altered the future effect of the initial license issuance, to be 
sure, but that could not be viewed as "past legal conse-
quences."  Nor could the change be said to impair rights 
possessed by Celtronix when it acted, as it could have had no 
grace period rights before it "acted" to acquire the license, 
and any payment delay covered by the new rule, i.e., any 
delay not already excused, necessarily occurred after the rule 

change.  If the rule could be viewed as "impos[ing] new 
duties" at all (in the sense of making the duty to pay 
installments more stringent), it would run afoul of Landgraf's 
concept only if it imposed them with regard to a "transac-
tion[ ] already completed."  That would be so if the "transac-
tion" at issue were the issuance of the license itself, as 
Celtronix urges, rather than the delay in payments.

     The examples used in the cases make clear that we should 
focus on the payment delays and not on initial issuance of the 
license.  As Justice Scalia noted in Landgraf, a new ban on 
gambling would not involve retroactivity in its application to 
existing casinos (which presumably would have been licensed 
by a state), because the "relevant retroactivity event is the 
primary activity of gambling, not the primary activity of 
constructing casinos."  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 293 n.3 (Scalia, 
J., concurring).  Similarly, Justice Scalia made clear in Bow-
en that there would be no violation of the APA's insistence on 
rules of "future effect" if the Secretary there had promulgat-
ed new reimbursement formulas for future services, even 
though the hospitals in question were operating under long-
term contracts negotiated in reliance on a prior, more gener-
ous rule.  488 U.S. at 220.

     Celtronix claims to have had a "vested right" to keep 
requesting additional grace periods and to force the Commis-
sion to consider any unique circumstances.  To this end, it 
cites Landgraf's statement that the judicial clear statement 
rule would apply where a statute would otherwise "impair 
rights a party possessed when he acted."  511 U.S. at 280.2 
But Celtronix never explains where this vested right came 
from.  The pre-auction license system offered no vested right 

__________
     2  The passage cited by Celtronix in fact makes no reference to 
"vested" rights, but other parts of the opinion do.  See 511 U.S. at 
268-69 & n.23 (quoting "vested rights" language from Justice 
Story's opinion in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 
2 Gall. 105, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814), and 
from Sturges v. Carter, 114 U.S. 511, 519 (1885));  id. at 275 n.29;  
see also id. at 290-94 (Scalia, J., concurring) (critiquing "vested 
rights" usage).

to any specific terms.  Rather, it is undisputed that the 
Commission always retained the power to alter the term of 
existing licenses by rulemaking.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Storer Broadcast Co., 351 U.S. 192, 205 (1956);  National 
Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 225 (1943);  
Committee for Effective Cellular Rules v. FCC, 53 F.3d 1309, 
1319-20 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  WBEN, Inc. v. FCC, 396 F.2d 601, 
617-18 (2d Cir. 1968).

     The introduction of auctions made no change in this aspect 
of the licensing regime.  In fact, Congress provided both that 
the Commission would retain its authority "to regulate or 
reclaim spectrum licenses," 47 U.S.C. s 309(j)(6)(C), and that 
nothing in the use of auctions would "be construed to convey 
any rights ... that differ from the rights that apply to other 
licenses...."  Id. s 309(j)(6)(D).

     Of course the grace period change may have altered the 
value of the rights Celtronix acquired by its winning bid and 
commitment to make the required payments.  This sort of 
retroactivity--characteristic of a rule having exclusively "fu-
ture effect" but affecting the desirability of past transac-
tions--has become known as "secondary retroactivity."  See 
Bowen, 488 U.S. at 219-20 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Under 
our authority to set aside rules that are arbitrary and capri-
cious, we review such rules to see whether they are reason-
able, "both in substance and in being made retroactive."  
U.S. Airwaves, Inc. v. FCC, 232 F.3d 227, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2000) 
(emphasis added).

     Here it's easy to find the rule reasonable in both respects.  
The Commission merely replaced the possibility of two (or 
maybe more) three-month grace periods, available only on a 
successful appeal to the Commission's discretion, with the 
assurance of two 90-day periods subject to 5% and 10% 
penalties on the delayed payments.  Looking at licensees as a 
class, there is no reason to think the change disadvantageous.  
Indeed, the Commission described the change as a "liberaliza-
tion."  Grace Period Order, p 108.  Nor does Celtronix sug-
gest that the rule change would inflict material injuries on 
any set of licencees (such as ones whose circumstances made 

receipt of Commission grace especially likely) that would 
offset its beneficial effects, or indeed that the Commission has 
ever exercised its discretion favorably.  Moreover, it seems 
utterly improbable that the old grace provisions could have 
induced reliance, either in the form of higher bids by licen-
sees at the bidding stage (as the change is so trivial and likely 
beneficial), or of any different conduct thereafter (as both old 
and new rule provide substantially equal motivations to avoid 
default).  See Bergerco, 129 F.3d at 195.  In sum, when one 
considers both the interests of licensees generally and of the 
Commission, the rule change's harms (the amorphous injury 
to hypothetical successful pleaders for discretionary grace, 
and the penalty fees) seem outweighed by its benefits (the 
certainty and clarity for all concerned and the elimination of a 
possibly long and costly decisionmaking process under vague 
criteria).  So, at least, the Commission could reasonably have 
concluded.

     Celtronix also urges a somewhat makeshift argument that 
the FCC's rule change was a breach of contract, citing United 
States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839 (1996).  But there the 
government had contractually bound itself to bear the risk of 
specified regulatory change adverse to certain firms that had 
acquired failed saving and loan associations in reliance on that 
promise.  Id. at 868-71.  Here, far from there being any such 
promise, there was, as we've noted, a long tradition of Com-
mission authority to change rules governing already-issued 
licenses and congressional provision for the application of the 
prior understandings to licenses acquired by auction.
