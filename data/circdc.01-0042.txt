     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Williams, Ginsburg, 
Henderson, Rogers, and Tatel, Circuit Judges.*

     Opinion for the Court en banc filed Per Curiam. 

     Per Curiam:  On December 22, 2000, then-President Clin-
ton granted a full and unconditional pardon to Archibald R. 
Schaffer III, for his conviction in the District Court of 
violating the anti-bribery provision of the Meat Inspection 
Act, 21 U.S.C. s 622 (1994).  Schaffer now moves this court 
to dismiss the case as moot.

__________
     * Judges Sentelle, Randolph, and Garland did not participate in 
this matter.

     The parties agree that the pardon rendered moot the 
ongoing appeals.  They are quite right on this point.  Accord-
ingly, under well-established principles governing the disposi-
tion of cases rendered moot during the pendency of an 
appeal, we hereby vacate the disputed panel decision in this 
case and all underlying judgments, verdicts, and decisions of 
the District Court.

                                I.

     Because this case has had a long and curious history, we 
offer a brief chronicle of the record leading to the instant 
motion:

     In the early summer of 1998, a jury found Schaffer guilty 
on two counts of a seven count indictment--one for violating 
the anti-bribery provision of the Meat Inspection Act and one 
for providing unlawful gratuities to a public official.  Persuad-
ed that the prosecution had submitted insufficient evidence to 
sustain the verdict, the District Court granted Schaffer's 
motion for acquittal on both counts, United States v. Schaffer, 
Cr. No. 96-0314 (D.D.C. Sept. 22, 1998) (order), and condi-
tionally denied his request for a new trial, Schaffer, Cr. No. 
96-0314 (D.D.C. Oct. 6, 1998) (order).  The independent 
counsel appealed.  On July 23, 1999, a panel of this court 
affirmed the District Court's judgment of acquittal on the 
unlawful gratuities charge, reversed and reinstated the jury 
verdict on the Meat Inspection Act charge, and remanded for 
sentencing on the latter charge.  Schaffer, 183 F.3d 833 (D.C. 
Cir. 1999) ("Schaffer I").

     Before this court's decision in Schaffer I was issued, Schaf-
fer filed a second motion for a new trial, this time pursuant to 
Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Schaf-
fer cited the newly-found and arguably exculpatory testimony 
of former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Al-
phonso Michael Espy, which had become available following 
Espy's own acquittal in a related prosecution.  Subsequently, 
after the decision in Schaffer I issued, the District Court 
granted Schaffer's Rule 33 motion for a new trial on the Meat 

Inspection Act charge.  Schaffer, 83 F. Supp. 2d 52 (D.D.C. 
1999).

     The independent counsel again appealed, this time chal-
lenging the trial court's order granting a new trial.  On June 
27, 2000, a different panel of this court reversed the order 
granting a new trial, reinstated the jury verdict on the Meat 
Inspection Act charge, and remanded the case for sentencing.  
Schaffer, 214 F.3d 1359 (D.C. Cir. 2000) ("Schaffer II").

     This court's ruling in Schaffer II set in motion two distinct 
trajectories of response.  First, the panel granted the inde-
pendent counsel's unopposed motion to expedite issuance of 
the panel's mandate to the District Court without, as would 
be the normal case, waiting for any potential petitions for 
rehearing and rehearing en banc to run their course.  Schaf-
fer, No. 99-3153 (D.C. Cir. July 17, 2000) (per curiam order).  
On remand, Schaffer moved the trial court to delay sentenc-
ing pending the outcome of his petitions for rehearing and en 
banc review in the Court of Appeals.  The District Court 
denied the motion and, on September 25, 2000, sentenced 
Schaffer to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day.  
Schaffer, 121 F. Supp. 2d 29 (D.D.C. 2000).

     Second, on July 19, 2000, Schaffer filed petitions for rehear-
ing and rehearing en banc of the Schaffer II decision.  The 
Schaffer II panel denied the petition for rehearing three 
months later.  Schaffer, 229 F.3d 284 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (per 
curiam order).  Shortly thereafter, on November 22, 2000, the 
full court granted Schaffer's petition for rehearing en banc, 
vacated the panel's June 27, 2000 Schaffer II decision, and 
scheduled oral argument for April 4, 2001.  Schaffer, 234 F.3d 
36 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (en banc) (per curiam order).  In a 
separate order, the court recalled the July 27, 2000 expedited 
mandate, which had set in motion the September 25, 2000 
sentencing.  Schaffer, No. 99-3153 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 1, 2000) 
(en banc) (per curiam order).  On December 14, 2000, the full 
court granted defendant's motion to continue his release 
pending appeal.  Schaffer, No. 99-3153 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 14, 
2000) (en banc) (per curiam order).

     On December 22, 2000, then-President Clinton granted a 
full and unconditional pardon to Schaffer.  Schaffer filed an 
unopposed motion and memorandum to dismiss all pending 
appeals as moot on January 4, 2001.  In a supplemental 
memorandum filed the next day, Schaffer urged this court to 
remand the case to the District Court so that it might 
determine what action, if any, should be taken to reconcile the 
"unreversed" new trial order and the preceding conviction.

                               II.

     The independent counsel, the appellant in this case, con-
cedes that "these appeals are moot and that the Presidential 
pardon ends all litigation."  Response of United States to 
Schaffer's Supplemental Memorandum at 2.  We agree.  In 
making this concession, however, the prosecutor advances the 
odd suggestion that Schaffer's conviction is established as a 
matter of law.  We disagree.  Final judgment never has been 
reached on this issue, because the appeals process was termi-
nated prematurely.

     Certainly, a pardon does not, standing alone, render Schaf-
fer innocent of the alleged Meat Inspection Act violation.  See 
In re North, 62 F.3d 1434, 1437 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (citing 
United States v. Noonan, 906 F.2d 952, 960 (3d Cir. 1990)).  
In fact, acceptance of a pardon may imply a confession of 
guilt.  See North, 62 F.3d at 1437 (citing Burdick v. United 
States, 236 U.S. 79, 91, 94 (1915)).  In the present case, the 
pardon states only that Schaffer receive

     A Full and Unconditional Pardon for his conviction in the 
     United State District Court for the District of the Dis-
     trict [sic] of Columbia of the charge of violation of 
     Section 622, Title 21, United States Code, as set forth in 
     an indictment (Criminal Action No. 96-0314 (JR)), for 
     which he was sentenced on September twenty-fifth, 2000, 
     to one year and one day's imprisonment and fined five 
     thousand dollars ($5000).
     
Pres. William J. Clinton, Executive Grant of Clemency (Dec. 
22, 2000).  In other words, the pardon acts on Schaffer's 

supposed conviction, without purporting to address Schaffer's 
innocence or guilt.

     Nevertheless, the independent counsel is wrong to suggest 
that Schaffer's conviction is a fait accompli.  Finality was 
never reached on the legal question of Schaffer's guilt.  The 
District Court ordered a new trial following Espy's acquittal;  
the prosecutor exercised a legitimate right to appeal that 
order;  a panel of this court reversed the order of the trial 
court;  the court expedited issuance of the mandate in Schaf-
fer II;  and Schaffer was sentenced on September 25, 2000.  
However, the matter was never actually put to rest, because 
this court granted Schaffer's petition for en banc review and 
recalled the mandate on December 1, 2000.  And in agreeing 
to en banc review, this court vacated the panel decision in 
Schaffer II.  It was at that uncertain juncture that then-
President Clinton pardoned Schaffer, thus rendering the case 
moot.

     When a case becomes moot on appeal, whether it be during 
initial review or in connection with consideration of a petition 
for rehearing or rehearing en banc, this court generally 
vacates the District Court's judgment, vacates any outstand-
ing panel decisions, and remands to the District Court with 
direction to dismiss.  See U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. 
Bonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25, 29 (1994);  United States 
v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950);  Clarke v. 
United States, 915 F.2d 699, 706-08 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en 
banc);  Flynt v. Weinberger, 762 F.2d 134, 135-36 (D.C. Cir. 
1985).  Because the present mootness results not from any 
voluntary acts of settlement or withdrawal by Schaffer, but 
from the unpredictable grace of a presidential pardon, vaca-
tur is here just and appropriate.  See U.S. Bancorp, 513 U.S. 
at 24-25.

     Given this posture of the case, the efficacy of the jury 
verdict against Schaffer remains only an unanswered question 
lost to the same mootness that the independent counsel so 
readily concedes.  The same is true of Schaffer's claim of 
innocence.  That claim will never again be tried.

     We hereby vacate all opinions, judgments, and verdicts of 
this court and the District Court relating to the Meat Inspec-
tion Act charge.  The matter will be remanded to the District 
Court with directions to dismiss the case as moot.

                                                                 So ordered.
