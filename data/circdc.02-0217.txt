     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  The sentence imposed by the 
district court in this case included an upward adjustment 
because the defendant, Leon Samuel, committed an offense 
while on release for another crime.  Samuel contends that 
this sentencing enhancement violated the rule, announced by 
the Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey, that "any fact 
that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory 
maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt."  530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).  Samuel argues 
that his sentence contravenes Apprendi because the fact that 
he was on release at the time of the second crime was neither 
proved to a jury nor specified in his plea agreement.  We 
reject this argument and affirm the judgment of the district 
court.

                                I

     On January 22, 1998, Samuel attempted to sell crack co-
caine to an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.  He was arrested and charged with conspira-
cy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute 50 
grams or more of cocaine base, a violation of 21 U.S.C. s 846.  
Samuel pled guilty to that offense on March 26, 1998, and was 
released pending sentencing by the district court.  While on 
release, Samuel was again arrested on a narcotics charge.  
This time, the arrest followed an investigation by the Cus-
toms Service.  On September 1, 1999, Samuel was taken into 
custody and subsequently indicted for possessing with intent 
to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine, a violation of 21 
U.S.C. s 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).  On July 18, 2000, Samu-
el pled guilty to that charge as well.

     On February 22, 2001, the district court sentenced Samuel 
for both crimes.  Although the maximum statutory sentence 

for a person convicted of a drug crime involving 50 grams or 
more of cocaine base is life imprisonment,1 the court's applica-
tion of the United States Sentencing Guidelines2 resulted in a 
lower sentence.  Based solely on the weight of the drugs 
involved and certain applicable adjustments, Samuel's guide-
lines offense level would have been 31.  This, together with 
his criminal history category of I, would have yielded a 
guideline sentencing range of 108-135 months.  See U.S. 
Sentencing Guidelines Manual ("U.S.S.G.") ch. 5, pt. A.  
However, because Samuel committed his second offense while 
on release pending sentencing, Guideline s 2J1.7 ("Commis-
sion of Offense While on Release") dictated a three-level 
increase in his offense level, which resulted in a range of 151-
188 months.  The government recommended, and the court 
imposed, a sentence at the bottom of that range:  concurrent 
terms of 151 months for each of his two convictions.  Follow-
ing the instruction of s 2J1.7, cmt. n.2, the court apportioned 
that total sentence as follows:  108 months for the drug 
crimes, plus an additional 43 months attributable to the 
enhancement for committing an offense while on release.3

__________
     1 See 21 U.S.C. ss 846, 841(a)(1) & (b)(1)(A)(iii).  These provi-
sions also provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  
However, the district court found that Samuel met the criteria of 18 
U.S.C. s 3553(f), which permits a court in specified circumstances 
to "impose a sentence pursuant to [the applicable guidelines] with-
out regard to any statutory minimum sentence."  See also U.S. 
Sentencing Guidelines Manual ("U.S.S.G.") s 5C1.2(a).

     2 The district court used the 1998 edition of the United States 
Sentencing Guidelines Manual, which is the edition to which we 
refer in this opinion.

     3 Note 2 of Guideline s 2J1.7 states that the sentencing court 
"should divide the sentence on the judgment form between the 
sentence attributable to the underlying offense and the sentence 
attributable to the enhancement."  U.S.S.G. s 2J1.7, cmt. n.2.  The 
court must, however, "ensure that the 'total punishment' (i.e., the 
sentence for the offense committed while on release plus the 
sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. s 3147) is in accord with the 
guideline range for the offense committed while on release, as 
adjusted by the enhancement in this section."  Id.

     At his sentencing hearing, Samuel unsuccessfully objected 
to the 43-month enhancement on the ground that it was 
barred by the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi.  Samu-
el raises the Apprendi claim again on appeal.  Because he 
made the appropriate objection in the district court, we 
review that claim under the harmless error standard of 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).  To reverse a 
conviction under that standard, "there must be (1) error, (2) 
that 'affect[s] substantial rights'--i.e., that is prejudicial."  
United States v. Perkins, 161 F.3d 66, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1998) 
(citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731, 734).  We 
consider the first question, whether the district court commit-
ted constitutional error in enhancing Samuel's sentence, de 
novo.  See United States v. Glover, 153 F.3d 749, 757 (D.C. 
Cir. 1998);  United States v. Sanchez, 269 F.3d 1250, 1272 
(11th Cir. 2001).4

                                II

     In Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Supreme Court held:  
"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that 
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maxi-
mum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt....  [I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature 
to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase 
the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defen-
dant is exposed."  530 U.S. at 490 (internal quotation marks 
omitted);  see Ring v. Arizona, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 2432 (2002).  
This court and the other courts of appeals have held that 
Apprendi's rule does not apply to offense characteristics that 
enhance a defendant's sentence under the Sentencing Guide-

__________
     4 In addition to his Apprendi argument, Samuel argued in the 
district court and reasserts here that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. s 3B1.2, 
his offense level should have been reduced by two levels because he 
was only a minor participant in the second offense.  As we have 
previously said, "[t]he application of section 3B1.2 is inherently fact-
bound and largely committed to the discretion of the trial judge."  
United States v. Caballero, 936 F.2d 1292, 1299 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  
We have examined Samuel's arguments and the record evidence 
and discern no abuse of discretion by the district court.

lines, but that do not increase the sentence above the statuto-
ry maximum for the offense of conviction.  See United States 
v. Webb, 255 F.3d 890, 896 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  United States v. 
Fields, 251 F.3d 1041, 1043-44 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (collecting 
other circuits' cases);  In re Sealed Case, 246 F.3d 696, 698-99 
(D.C. Cir. 2001).5  Samuel does not dispute that view and, 
just last month, the Supreme Court confirmed it.  See Harris 
v. United States, 122 S. Ct. at 2406, 2420 (2002);  id. at 2415, 
2418-19 (plurality opinion of Kennedy, J.);  id. at 2420-21 
(Breyer, J., concurring).

     Samuel contends, however, that s 2J1.7 is unlike other 
Sentencing Guidelines enhancements because it does not in-
dependently increase a defendant's offense level, but rather 
does so only by reference to the violation of another statutory 
provision:  18 U.S.C. s 3147.  Guideline s 2J1.7 states:

     If an enhancement under 18 U.S.C. s 3147 applies, add 3 
     levels to the offense level for the offense committed while 
     on release as if this section were a specific offense 
     characteristic contained in the offense guideline for the 
     offense committed while on release.
     
Section 3147, in turn, provides:

     A person convicted of an offense while released under 
     this chapter shall be sentenced, in addition to the sen-
     tence prescribed for the offense to--
     
          (1) a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years 
          if the offense is a felony....
          
18 U.S.C. s 3147.  Samuel contends that, because s 2J1.7 
applies only "[i]f an enhancement under 18 U.S.C. s 3147 
applies," a district court may not apply the three-level en-
hancement without first finding that the defendant violated 18 
U.S.C. s 3147.  Such a finding, he insists, requires either a 
jury verdict or an express plea to having committed the 
offense while on release--neither of which occurred here.  
__________
     5 See also Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 481 ("We should be clear that 
nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges 
to exercise discretion--taking into consideration various factors 
relating both to offense and offender--in imposing a judgment 
within the range prescribed by statute.").

Samuel further contends that, as a result of the court's 
application of s 2J1.7, he was sentenced to 43 months more 
than he would have been sentenced on the drug crimes to 
which he did plead, and exposed to a penalty of up to 10 years 
more than the statutory maximum for those crimes.  All of 
this, he argues, violates the rule of Apprendi.

     In response to Samuel's contentions, the government first 
asserts that 18 U.S.C. s 3147 is not an offense at all, but 
merely a sentencing provision that applies to convictions for 
other offenses.  We are not so sure.  Although we have found 
no reported case in which the government charged a defen-
dant with a violation of 18 U.S.C. s 3147, that section is not 
dissimilar in structure to 18 U.S.C. s 924(c), a provision that 
is often charged as a separate offense.6  Moreover, the legis-
lative history of s 3147 is ambiguous as to whether the 
section authorizes an independent criminal offense.7

__________
     6 18 U.S.C. s 924(c)(1)(A)(i) states:

          ... [A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of 
          violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a 
          firearm ... shall, in addition to the punishment for such 
          crime of violence or drug trafficking crime--
          
               (I) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 
               5 years....
          
     7 The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 initially enacted 
a version of s 3147 like that now in force, except that it provided for 
"a term of imprisonment of not less than two years and not more 
than ten years if the offense is a felony."  Pub. L. No. 98-473, tit. 
II, s 203(a), 98 Stat. 1976, 1983 (emphasis added).  Congress 
simultaneously provided, however, that s 3147 would be amended 
by deleting the italicized phrase upon implementation of the Sen-
tencing Guidelines.  See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 
No. 98-473, tit. II, ch. 2, ss 222(g), 235(a)(1), 98 Stat. 1987, 2028-29, 
2031-32.  The Senate Report states that this amendment "elimi-
nat[es] the mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing 
sentencing guidelines."  S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 186 (1983).  Al-
though the Sentencing Commission interprets this language as 
indicating that "18 U.S.C. s 3147 is an enhancement provision, 
rather than an offense," U.S.S.G. s 2J1.7, cmt. n.1;  see id. at cmt. 
background, the language could as easily be read as authorizing a 

     But whether or not Samuel could have been separately 
charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. s 3147, the fact is that 
he was not.  Both the indictment and the judgment refer only 
to the narcotics offenses to which Samuel pled guilty.  Hence, 
Samuel's record does not reflect a conviction for a crime to 
which he neither pled nor was convicted.  Instead, the district 
court merely sentenced him under the Sentencing Guidelines 
for the narcotics offenses to which he did plead, considering 
the fact that Samuel committed an offense while on release 
just as the court would have considered any other specific 
offense characteristic that adjusts an offense level upward.  
See U.S.S.G. ch. 2, introductory cmt. (noting that "[e]ach 
offense has a corresponding base offense level and may have 
one or more specific offense characteristics that adjust the 
offense level upward or downward").8

     Samuel argues that Guideline s 2J1.7 is not an ordinary 
sentencing enhancement.  Rather, because it applies only "[i]f 
an enhancement under 18 U.S.C. s 3147 applies," Samuel 
contends that a predicate for a s 2J1.7 enhancement is a 
conviction for violating s 3147.  But that view ignores the 
balance of the language of s 2J1.7, which directs the court to 
"add 3 levels to the offense level for the offense committed 
while on release as if this section were a specific offense 
characteristic contained in the offense guideline for the of-
fense committed while on release."  U.S.S.G. s 2J1.7 (empha-
sis added).  Moreover, Samuel's position is contrary to the 
view of the Sentencing Commission, which treats "18 U.S.C. 
s 3147 [as] an enhancement provision, rather than an of-
fense," and explains that Guideline s 2J1.7 merely "provides 
a specific offense characteristic to increase the offense level 
for the offense committed while on release."  U.S.S.G. 
s 2J1.7, cmt. n.1.  The Sentencing Commission's interpreta-
tion of its own guideline is binding on this court, unless that 
interpretation violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or 

__________
separate offense, the penalty for which is determined by the guide-
lines without reference to the previous two-year mandatory mini-
mum.

     8 See, e.g., U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(b)(1) (listing possession of a firearm 
as a specific offense characteristic, and increasing the offense level 
for drug offenses if the defendant possessed a firearm).

is inconsistent with or a plainly erroneous reading of the 
guideline.  Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993).  
None of those caveats applies.9

     The fact that the offense characteristic at issue here--
committing the offense while on release for another crime--is 
specified by statute does not disturb our conclusion.  See 
Harris, 122 S. Ct. at 2419 (plurality opinion of Kennedy, J.) 
("The judge may select any sentence within the range, based 
on facts not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury--
even if those facts are specified by the legislature, and even if 
they persuade the judge to choose a much higher sentence 
than he or she otherwise would have imposed." (emphasis 
added));  see id. at 2420 (Breyer, J., concurring).10  Nor does 
it matter that the offense characteristic may also be treated 
as an independent crime.11  To the contrary, many of the 
offense characteristics that enhance offense levels under the 
guidelines may be charged as separate crimes.12  In Sealed 

__________
     9 Although the Commission's interpretation of Guideline s 2J1.7 
is binding on us, its view of whether 18 U.S.C. s 3147 may be 
charged as an independent crime is not.  However, as discussed 
above, we do not need to decide whether s 3147 could be charged 
as an independent offense in order to decide this case.  See supra 
note 7 and accompanying text.

     10 See also 28 U.S.C. s 994(h) (directing the Sentencing Commis-
sion to assure that the guidelines include terms of imprisonment "at 
or near the maximum term authorized" for categories of defendants 
specified in the statute);  Federal Criminal Code and Rules 1283-
97 (West 2002) (collecting session laws that, inter alia, direct the 
Sentencing Commission to include specified sentencing enhance-
ments in the guidelines).

     11 Cf. Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 397 (1995) (holding 
that when uncharged conduct is used to arrive "at a sentence within 
the statutorily authorized punishment range," the defendant "is 
punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only for the offense of 
which the defendant is convicted," notwithstanding that the un-
charged conduct may also constitute a distinct offense).

     12 Compare, e.g., U.S.S.G. s 2A2.2(b)(2)(B) (increasing the offense 
level for an aggravated assault if a firearm was used), with 18 

Case, for example, the defendant pled guilty to unlawful 
possession of a firearm, and the district court enhanced the 
sentence (under U.S.S.G. s 2K2.1(b)) after finding that the 
defendant had threatened to shoot someone with that firearm.  
246 F.3d at 697-98.  Although we noted that the threat was 
"a separate felony," we nonetheless held Apprendi inapplica-
ble to the enhancement of the underlying offense.  Id.

     Finally, contrary to Samuel's contention, the district court's 
application of s 2J1.7 neither increased his sentence above 
the statutory maximum for the drug offenses to which he pled 
guilty, nor exposed him to the possibility of such an increase.  
The former point is obvious, as Samuel's actual sentence of 
108 months was considerably lower than the statutory maxi-
mum sentence of life imprisonment applicable to each drug 
offense.  The latter point is equally obvious, as application of 
Guideline s 2J1.7 could not have exposed Samuel to a sen-
tence greater than life in prison, as there is no greater 
sentence (other than capital punishment) in the federal sys-
tem.13  Thus, the impact of s 2J1.7 was limited to determin-

__________
U.S.C. s 924(c)(1)(A) (making it unlawful to use or carry a firearm 
during and in relation to a crime of violence);  U.S.S.G. s 2B3.1(4), 
(5) (increasing the offense level for robbery if kidnapping or car-
jacking was involved), with 18 U.S.C. s 1201 (defining the offense of 
kidnapping), and id. s 2119 (defining the offense of carjacking);  
U.S.S.G. s 3A1.2(b) (increasing the offense level for any offense if 
the defendant assaulted a law enforcement officer during the of-
fense), with 18 U.S.C. s 111 (making it an offense to assault a 
government officer);  U.S.S.G. s 3B1.1 (increasing the offense level 
for any offense if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a 
criminal activity that involved five or more participants), with 18 
U.S.C. s 371 (criminalizing conspiracy to commit any offense 
against the United States);  U.S.S.G. s 3C1.1 (increasing the offense 
level for any offense if the defendant obstructed justice during the 
course of the prosecution of the offense), with 18 U.S.C. s 1512(b) 
(making it an offense to obstruct official proceedings).

     13 Samuel contends that, as a consequence of 18 U.S.C. s 3147, he 
was exposed to a sentence of life plus 10 years, rather than merely 
to the statutory maximum of life.  However, because Congress has 
abolished parole for federal prisoners, see Sentencing Reform Act 

ing where, within that statutory maximum, Samuel should be 
sentenced.

     Moreover, this limit upon s 2J1.7 applies not only to defen-
dants like Samuel, whose underlying offenses carry maximum 
sentences of life, but also to defendants whose offenses of 
conviction carry substantially lower statutory maxima.  Un-
der the Sentencing Guidelines, a court may impose a sentence 
anywhere within the applicable guideline range, "provided 
that the sentence ... is not greater than the statutorily 
authorized maximum sentence."  U.S.S.G. s 5G1.1;  see 
Fields, 251 F.3d at 1046.  The government contends, and we 
agree, that this limit applies even though 18 U.S.C. s 3147(1) 
states that a person convicted of an offense while on release 
"shall be sentenced, in addition to the sentence prescribed 
for the offense to ... a term of imprisonment of not more 
than ten years" (emphasis added).  Where a defendant has 
not been separately convicted of an offense under s 3147, but 
instead has merely had his offense level increased under 
Guideline s 2J1.7, the Sentencing Guidelines decree that the 
maximum term to which he may be sentenced is the maxi-
mum authorized for the underlying offense.  See U.S.S.G. 
s 5G1.1;  see also id. s 2J1.7, cmt. background ("This guide-
line is drafted to enable the court to determine and imple-
ment a combined 'total punishment' consistent with the over-
all structure of the guidelines....").  Accordingly, application 
of s 2J1.7 can neither increase a defendant's sentence above 
the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction, nor 
expose him to the possibility of such an increase.

     For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district 
court did not commit Apprendi error when it enhanced 
Samuel's sentence because he committed the second of his 
narcotics offenses while he was on release for the first.  In 

__________
s 218, 98 Stat. at 2027, neither we nor the government can discern 
any difference between a sentence of life and a sentence of life plus 
10 years--even if some trial judges have included such sentences in 
their judgments.  Nor does Samuel suggest any difference, other 
than to speculate that someday Congress may pass a statute that 
differentiates between the two.

reaching that conclusion, we note that we are in accord with 
the other circuits that have addressed the question. See 
United States v. Randall, 287 F.3d 27, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2002);  
United States v. Ellis, 241 F.3d 1096, 1104 (9th Cir. 2001);  
see also United States v. Parolin, 239 F.3d 922, 930 (7th Cir. 
2001) (on review for plain error).

     We further note that, even if the enhancement of Samuel's 
sentence were error under Apprendi, it would at most be 
harmless error and hence not grounds for reversal.  First, 
because Samuel's actual sentence fell below the statutory 
maximum for his drug trafficking offenses, Samuel was not 
prejudiced by the alleged Apprendi error.  See Webb, 255 
F.3d at 898.  Second, because Samuel did not and could not 
contest the fact that he was on release at the time he 
committed his second offense,14 his failure to plead to that 
point expressly was likewise harmless, even if the fact that he 
was on release were properly regarded as the equivalent of 
an offense element.  See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 
19 (1999) (holding that the failure to submit an element to the 
jury was harmless because the "defendant did not, and appar-
ently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted 
element").

                               III

     Leon Samuel asks this court to hold that, when the govern-
ment seeks to enhance a defendant's sentence for an offense 
because he committed it while on release for an earlier crime, 
that circumstance is functionally an element and must either 
be proved to a jury or pled to by the defendant.  Such a 
ruling in Samuel's favor would grant him only a theoretical 

__________
     14 According to his plea, Samuel committed the second offense on 
September 1, 1999.  The district court's records reflect both that he 
was released pending sentencing for the first offense on March 26, 
1998, and that sentencing on that offense had not been completed 
on September 1, 1999.  Moreover, although Samuel's attorney 
argued at sentencing that these facts had to be found by a jury, she 
conceded that "the record is abundantly clear that he was on 
release" at the time of the second offense.  2/16/01 Tr. at 21.

victory, as the evidence is incontrovertible that he was on 
release at the time of his second offense.  See supra note 14.  
It could, however, be deeply damaging to other defendants, 
because if the existence of that circumstance were the equiva-
lent of an element, the government would be permitted--
indeed required--to put before the jury facts that are unre-
lated to the underlying crime and normally regarded as quite 
prejudicial.  See United States v. Crowder, 141 F.3d 1202, 
1203 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (holding that a defendant cannot pre-
clude the government from introducing evidence establishing 
an element of an offense by stipulating to that element).

     Apprendi does not require us to impose such a burden 
either on the government or on those it accuses of crimes.  
Because Guideline s 2J1.7 does no more than direct the court 
to the applicable sentencing range within the statutory maxi-
mum set by Congress, the fact that the defendant was on
