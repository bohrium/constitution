     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  The Public Utilities Commission of 
the State of California ("CALPUC") seeks review of orders 
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowing the 
California Independent System Operator ("ISO") to enter 
into "Reliability Must-Run" ("RMR") contracts with genera-
tors owned by entities not subject to the Commission's rate 
jurisdiction, and to pass through the costs of such contracts in 
the ISO's rates without filing under s 205 of the Federal 
Power Act ("FPA").  See 16 U.S.C. s 824d (1994).  Because 
it considered the ISO's tariff to be satisfactory as a formula 
rate, the Commission rejected the argument that a s 205 
filing was required.  CALPUC contends that the ISO tariff 
does not meet the Commission's standards for formula rates, 
and alternatively, that even if it is a valid formula rate, s 205 
requires re-filing when the formula is changed, which 
CALPUC maintains occurs when the ISO adds a new compo-
nent by entering a new RMR contract.  Additionally, 
CALPUC maintains that the Commission's reliance on s 206 
of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. s 824e (1994), is misplaced because the 
availability of review under s 206 does not abrogate the 
s 205 filing requirement.  We hold that the Commission 
could properly determine that although the RMR contracts 
are components of the formula rate or affect the ultimate 
rates charged pursuant to the formula, s 205 filing was not 
required and s 206 affords an adequate statutory remedy.  
Accordingly, we deny the petition.

                                I.

     The State of California has restructured its electric supply 
operations, as implemented in large part by Commission 
decisions, so that the ISO now operates portions of the 
transmission systems of three California investor-owned utili-
ties, referred to as Responsible Utilities:  Pacific Gas & 
Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company 
("SoCal Edison"), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company.  
See Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 91 F.E.R.C. p 63,008, at 65,102 
(2000) ("Southern").  In providing transmission services, the 
ISO is required to maintain transmission system reliability.  
See Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,322, at 62,486 
(1997).  The ISO accomplishes this in part by use of RMR 
contracts to ensure ancillary services, voltage support, and 
energy to support the reliability of the ISO-controlled grid.1  
See Southern, 91 F.E.R.C. at 65,103.  Under the RMR struc-
ture approved by the Commission, see Cal. Indep. Sys. Oper-
ator Corp., 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,229 (1999);  Cal. Indep. Sys. 
Operator Corp., 87 F.E.R.C. p 61,250 (1999);  see generally 
Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,122, at 61,554-58 

__________
     1  The Commission has explained:

     Under the RMR contracts, the ISO pays the RMR unit a 
     portion of its fixed costs to stand ready to deliver an hourly 
     minimum energy requirement set by the ISO (annual availabili-
     ty payment).  When generating to ensure reliability, the con-
     tracts also allow the RMR unit to receive for the energy it 
     produces either the variable cost payment included in the 
     contract or market prices.
     
Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 90 F.E.R.C. p 61,345, at 62,135 
(2000).  Before the Commission, the Northern California Power 
Agency ("NCPA") stated that the ISO is unable to rely on the 
market to ensure that RMR units are on line when needed, because 
the ISO market is

     [a] market burdened by price caps and restrictions ... 
     mak[ing] it particularly difficult to count on the dispatch of 
     RMR units, because units that are needed for only a few hours 
     a year must command very high prices if they are to recover 
     their costs.  Price caps prevent this, making RMR contracts a 
     necessity.
     
(1997), the cost responsibility for the RMR contracts is re-
flected in s 5.2.8 of the ISO tariff.2  Pursuant to its tariff, the 
ISO passes through to the Responsible Utilities the costs of 
RMR contracts in each utility's service area.  See supra n.2;  
see also Southern, 91 F.E.R.C. at 65,102-03.  CALPUC's 
concern arises because the costs are then passed along by the 
utilities to California retail ratepayers.

     Insofar as CALPUC is concerned, the problem arose after 
the Commission approved Amendment 22 to the ISO tariff.  
The ISO requested the amendment, in September 1999, in 
order to enhance its ability to support reliability of the ISO-
controlled grid.  Relevant here is the provision allowing the 

__________
     2  Section 5.2.8 of the ISO tariff provides in relevant part:

     [T]he costs incurred by the ISO under each [RMR] Contract 
     shall be payable to the ISO by the Responsible Utility in whose 
     Service Area the [RMR] Generating Units covered by such 
     [RMR] Contract are located, or, where a [RMR] Generating 
     Unit is located outside the Service Area of any Responsible 
     Utility, by the Responsible Utility or Responsible Utilities 
     whose Service Area are contiguous to the Service Area in 
     which the Generating Unit is located, in proportion to the 
     benefits that each such Responsible Utility receives, as deter-
     mined by the ISO.  Where costs incurred by the ISO under a 
     [RMR] Contract are allocated among two or more Responsible 
     Utilities pursuant to this section, the ISO will file the allocation 
     under Section 205 of the [FPA].

ISO to enter into RMR contracts with generating units that 
are outside the service area of any Responsible Utility and 
that make no jurisdictional sales of power.  See FPA s 201.  
The Commission conditionally approved Amendment 22 on 
November 24, 1999.  Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 89 
F.E.R.C. p 61,229, at 61,680 (1999).  The Commission declined 
to require that the ISO make a s 205 filing every time it 
seeks to pass through RMR contract costs involving a non-
jurisdictional entity.  See id. at 61,683-84.  Responding to 
concerns expressed by CALPUC and SoCal Edison, the 
Commission noted, however, that the ISO's proposal did not 
explain how the ISO would allocate RMR costs between 
Responsible Utilities if more than one was contiguous with an 
RMR unit.  Id. at 61,684.  The Commission stated:  "As the 
ISO is, in effect, proposing a formula rate, this lack of 
specificity is unacceptable."  Id.  The Commission therefore 
required the ISO to make a separate filing under s 205 
whenever it sought to allocate RMR costs where more than 
one Responsible Utility was contiguous to an RMR unit, and 
to revise its tariff accordingly.  Id.

     CALPUC (and others) sought rehearing regarding, as rele-
vant here, the necessity of s 205 filings for RMR contracts 
with non-jurisdictional entities.  CALPUC asserted that "[i]n 
the absence of such a requirement California ratepayers will 
be subject to paying RMR contract costs which have been 
negotiated by the ISO without any public, consumer, or 
ratepayer input, and with no regulatory review."  CALPUC 
argued that the charging of RMR costs to a Responsible 
Utility by the ISO was a jurisdictional sale under s 205 and, 
therefore, the Commission was obligated to ensure that such 
charges were just and reasonable.  The Commission denied 
rehearing, responding:

     The recovery of RMR costs under the ISO's tariff is 
     through a formula rate.  The ISO purchases RMR ser-
     vices under the contracts and passes through the costs to 
     Responsible Utilities under the formula rate.  The filed 
     rate in this circumstance is the formula.  SoCal Edison, 
     [CALPUC], and others may challenge the costs recov-
     
     ered under this formula by filing a complaint under FPA 
     Section 206, and such challenges to costs recovered un-
     der a formula rate are not limited to prospective relief.  
     Accordingly, we see no purpose to also requiring the 
     filing under FPA Section 205 of each contract the ISO 
     enters into with a non-jurisdictional entity.

                               II.

     On appeal, CALPUC contends that the Commission has 
violated both the FPA and its obligation to engage in rea-
soned decisionmaking.  Essentially, CALPUC maintains that 
s 205 filing of the non-jurisdictional RMR contracts is re-
quired because RMR contract costs significantly affect the 
ISO's s 5.2.8 RMR rate, and thus must be filed under FPA 
ss 205(c) and (d).  The court reviews the Commission's or-
ders under the Administrative Procedure Act's arbitrary and 
capricious standard.  See Sithe/Independence Power Part-
ners, L.P. v. FERC, 165 F.3d 944, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  5 
U.S.C. s 706(2)(A) (1994).  "Because '[i]ssues of rate design 
are fairly technical and, insofar as they are not technical, 
involve policy judgments that lie at the core of the regulatory 
mission,' our review of whether a particular rate design is 
'just and reasonable' is highly deferential."  Id. (quoting 
Town of Norwood v. FERC, 962 F.2d 20, 22 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).  
Thus, for CALPUC to prevail, the court must be able to 
conclude that the Commission was required to review the 
RMR contracts with non-jurisdictional entities pursuant to 
s 205 before allowing the pass through of RMR costs and 
could not rely on possible investigation, review, and refund 
proceedings under s 206.  Cf. La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. 
FERC, 174 F.3d 218, 231 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

     It can hardly be doubted at this late date that the Commis-
sion "need not confine rates to specific, absolute numbers but 
may approve a tariff containing a rate 'formula' or a rate 
'rule'...."  Transwestern Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 897 F.2d 
570, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The Commission has been accept-

ing formula rates since the early 1970s.  See Me. Yankee 
Atomic Power Co., 42 F.E.R.C. p 61,307, at 61,923 (1988).  As 
defined by the Commission, a formula rate specifies the cost 
components that form the basis of the rates a utility charges 
its customers.  Hampshire Gas Co., 6 F.E.R.C. p 61,249, at 
61,607 (1979).  The Commission's acceptance of formula rates 
is premised on the rate design's "fixed, predictable nature," 
Ocean State Power II, 69 F.E.R.C. p 61,146, at 61,552 (1994), 
which both allows a utility to recover costs that may fluctuate 
over time and prevents a utility from utilizing excessive 
discretion in determining the ultimate amounts charged to 
customers.  See id.  Thus, " '[w]hen the Commission accepts 
a formula rate as a filed rate, it grants waiver of the filing 
and notice requirements of [s 205] [, and] [t]he utility's rates, 
then, can change repeatedly, without notice to the Commis-
sion, provided those changes are consistent with the formu-
la.' "  Ala. Power Co. v. FERC, 993 F.2d 1557, 1567-68 (D.C. 
Cir. 1993) (quoting San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 46 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,363, at 62,129-30 (1989)).  As further explained, because 
"the formula itself is the rate, not the particular components 
of the formula, ... periodic adjustments made in accordance 
with the Commission-approved formula do not constitute 
changes in the rate itself and accordingly do not require [s] 
205 filings."  Ocean State Power II, 69 F.E.R.C. at 61,544-45 
(footnote omitted).3

__________
     3  Contrary to the positions taken by SoCal Edison and NCPA, 
CALPUC argued before the Commission that the filed rate doctrine 
did not apply to RMR costs arising from contracts with non-
jurisdictional entities which had not been reviewed by the Commis-
sion pursuant to s 205.  Consequently, CALPUC cannot now chal-
lenge s 5.2.8's pass through of such costs on the ground that it 
violates the filed rate doctrine.  See, e.g., Platte River Whooping 
Crane Critical Habitat Maint. Trust v. FERC, 962 F.2d 27, 34-35 
(D.C. Cir. 1992);  see also 16 U.S.C. s 825l(b) (1994).  In any event, 
the court has rejected the notion that charges assessed pursuant to 
a formula rate violate the filed rate doctrine;  rather, the formula 
itself is the filed rate that provides sufficient notice to ratepayers 
for purposes of the doctrine.  See Transwestern, 897 F.2d at 577-
78.

     The Commission has required s 205 filings, as CALPUC 
points out, for matters that are central to the determination 
of a level of payments that affect the rate charged for 
jurisdictional service.  See, e.g., Cent. & S.W. Servs., Inc., 48 
F.E.R.C. p 61,197, at 61,733-34 (1989), reh'g denied, 49 
F.E.R.C. p 61,118 (1989) (collectively "Central");  infra n.5.  
Yet it is the norm not dispute, not to require s 205 filing of 
contracts that merely affect jurisdictional rates.  Most perti-
nent here, the Commission has explained:

     For example, a formula rate may have a component 
     covering labor costs.  Obviously, if the public utility 
     enters into a new wage agreement, this will affect the 
     rate to be charged.  However, the wage agreement 
     would not need to be filed with the Commission, although 
     it might have to be produced in the course of discovery in 
     a litigated case or in an audit.
     
Prior Notice and Filing Requirements Under Part II of the 
Federal Power Act, 64 F.E.R.C. p 61,139 app. at 61,988 n.3 
(1993) ("Prior Notice and Filing").

     CALPUC acknowledges that the ISO must enter into RMR 
contracts in order to ensure grid reliability and to carry out 
the ISO's own jurisdictional transmission services.  It does 
not contend that any non-jurisdictional RMR costs are unjust 
or unreasonable, or unfairly charged to the Responsible Utili-
ties.  Further, it makes no claim that the ISO has changed 
the manner in which it enters into RMR contracts since the 
Commission approved Amendment 22 or otherwise changed 
its methodology for calculating or charging rates for the 
RMR service it procures.  Cf. Ocean State Power II, 69 
F.E.R.C. at 61,543.  Given the bid-based process used by the 
ISO to identify and enter into low-bid RMR contracts, it 
would appear to follow that the Commission could properly 
rely on a previously approved formula rate and s 206 pro-
ceedings to ensure just and reasonable rates.4  CALPUC has 

__________
     4  CALPUC's reliance on cases like Northern Natural Gas Co. 
v. FERC, 929 F.2d 1261 (8th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that the 

three responses:  (1) The ISO's s 5.2.8 rate cannot be justi-
fied as a formula rate because it lacks the necessary specifici-
ty;  (2) the Commission abused its discretion under s 205(c) 
by failing to require s 205 filing inasmuch as the RMR 
generating units have undisputed locational market power 
and can and have used that market power to their advantage 
in negotiating RMR contracts;  and (3) the availability of 
review under s 206 does not excuse failure to require filing 
under s 205 in the first instance.  Each response is unper-
suasive.

     First, exactly how much detail is necessary, and the nature 
of that detail, for a particular formula rate will vary.  While 
there is undoubtedly some irreducible minimum of detail 
needed for a valid formula rate, cf. City of Cleveland, Ohio v. 
FERC, 773 F.2d 1368, 1376-77 (D.C. Cir. 1985), with some 
formulae being lengthy, see, e.g., Holyoke Water Power Co. v. 
FERC, 799 F.2d 755, 756 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the amount of the 
detail in a formula rate is not the dispositive consideration.  
Cf. La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 174 F.3d at 230-31;  Prior Notice 
and Filing, 64 F.E.R.C. at 61,988 n.3.  As the court observed 
in considering a challenge to a compliance filing alleged to be 
impermissibly vague, the court's concern is not whether the 
challenged provisions fall short "of some absolute prescribed 
standard literally set forth in the statute and regulations," but 
"of the minimum specificity that the Commission could rea-
sonably require."  City of Cleveland, 773 F.2d at 1376.  So 
too here.

     Contrary to CALPUC's contention, the fact that the ISO 
has discretion about RMR contracting with non-jurisdictional 

__________
bundling of the rates for jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional service 
makes the non-jurisdictional service one component of the jurisdic-
tional rate is misplaced.  As the Commission observes in its Brief at 
15, that case confirmed that the Commission may regulate rates 
charged for non-jurisdictional gathering service when performed in 
connection with jurisdictional interstate transportation service, 
Northern Natural, 929 F.2d at 1263, not that it "must regulate all 
non-jurisdictional services if somehow connected to a jurisdictional 
service."

entities does not make the ISO's formula rate any more of a 
"blank check" than other formula rates allowing recovery of 
costs incurred under contracts with non-jurisdictional enti-
ties.5  See Prior Notice and Filing, 64 F.E.R.C. at 61,988 n.3.  
The ISO functions within a statutory and regulatory context 
that requires it to select RMR contracts as a result of the 
Local Areas Reliability Service ("LARS") solicitation process, 
which is designed to lower RMR costs by designating as 
RMR units those generating units that can provide needed 
RMR service at the lowest cost.  Although Amendment 22 
changed the circumstances under which the ISO operates, its 
purpose, as relevant here, was to enable the ISO to meet 
reliability requirements.  Furthermore, assuming as 
CALPUC contends, that prior to Amendment 22, s 5.2.8 was 
originally intended only to allocate to Responsible Utilities 
the RMR rates determined in other s 205 proceedings, the 
Commission was not thereby precluded from treating s 5.2.8 
as a formula rate.  CALPUC's reliance on the detailed nature 
of fuel cost adjustment clauses, moreover, does not demon-
strate that s 5.2.8 fails to provide purchasers with protection 
equivalent to that which they receive pursuant to such claus-
es.6  Insofar as s 5.2.8 does not require the ISO to notify 

__________
     5  CALPUC relies on Central.  In that case, the Commission 
required the utility to specify its planning reserve in its operating 
agreement because, absent such a requirement, the utility would 
have had unfettered discretion to set the level of the reserve which, 
in turn, affected rates ultimately charged.  See 48 F.E.R.C. at 
61,733-34;  see also 49 F.E.R.C. p 61,118.  By contrast, the ISO 
must pass through 100% of RMR costs under s 5.2.8, see supra n.2;  
see also Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 90 F.E.R.C. at 62,042, and, 
therefore, does not possess the unbridled discretion which the 
Commission found problematic in Central.

     6  CALPUC has not suggested that fuel cost adjustment clauses, 
as a general matter, limit the amount that a component may 
increase, or decrease, without prior s 205 filing and review by the 
Commission.  In Missouri Public Service Co., 48 F.E.R.C. p 61,011 
(1989), the Commission observed:

     The fuel adjustment clause is intended to keep utilities whole 
     with respect to changes in the cost of their fuel.  It allows 
     
customers when a new RMR contract is added to the formula, 
the court has rejected the view that a formula rate does not 
provide sufficient notice of the rate to ratepayers.  See 
Transwestern, 897 F.2d at 577-78.

     For similar reasons, CALPUC's contention that each new 
RMR contract constitutes a new, separate component of the 
ISO's formula rate requiring a new s 205 filing has been 
rejected by the Commission, consistent with its position that 
"periodic adjustments [in costs] made in accordance with the 
Commission-approved formula do not constitute changes in 
the rate itself and accordingly do not require [additional] 
[s] 205 filings."  Ocean State Power II, 69 F.E.R.C. at 
61,544-45;  cf. Wisc. Pub. Serv. Corp., 69 F.E.R.C. p 61,209, at 
61,829 (1994).  CALPUC's reliance on three recent orders of 
the Commission shows not that the Commission acted unlaw-
fully in the orders on review, but rather that the Commission 
responded differently in different circumstances.7  Moreover, 

__________
     utilities to pass through to their ratepayers increases or de-
     creases in the cost of their fuel, without having to make 
     separate rate filings to reflect each change in fuel cost, and 
     without having to obtain Commission review of each change in 
     fuel cost.
     
Id. at 61,078 (footnote omitted);  see also Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. 
FERC, 600 F.2d 944, 952 (D.C. Cir. 1979).  The ISO's 100% pass 
through of RMR contract costs under s 5.2.8 operates in a similar 
fashion and serves a similar purpose.

     7  See Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 91 F.E.R.C. p 61,205, at 
61,723-24 (2000), order accepting in part and rejecting in part 
compliance filing, 93 F.E.R.C. p 61,104, at 61,287-89 (2000) (collec-
tively "TAC Cases");  City of Vernon, California, 93 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,103 (2000).  In none of these orders did the Commission 
require contract-by-contract review of agreements between the ISO 
and third parties, as CALPUC maintains is required here.  Rather, 
in each order the Commission reviewed the rates of otherwise non-
jurisdictional governmental utilities that sought to join the ISO as 
participating transmission owners.  In the TAC Cases, the Commis-
sion, after rejecting a proposed amendment to the ISO tariff that 
contained no mechanism for Commission review of the rates of 
governmental utilities to become a part of the ISO, 91 F.E.R.C. at 

assuming CALPUC could show that the ISO's formula rate 
was defective in some manner, the remedy would not neces-
sarily be to require RMR contracts with non-jurisdictional 
entities to be filed under s 205;  an obvious alternative would 
be the development of a better formula, and the court would 
leave that option to the Commission's expertise in rate de-
sign.

     Second, the Commission has long been aware of the loca-
tional market power issues inherent in the ISO's efforts to 
contract for RMR service.  See Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 81 
F.E.R.C. at 61,557.  The Commission has also been aware of 
the need to protect against market distortions in the realm of 
the ISO's RMR operations and resulting contracts with gen-
erating units.  Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 87 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,250, at 61,968 (1999).  In conditionally approving the 
ISO's operations in 1997, the Commission supported the 
ISO's "least-cost" approach in selecting RMR units.  See Pac. 
Gas & Elec. Co., 81 F.E.R.C. at 61,555, 61,557-58.  In seeking 
approval of Amendment 22, the ISO explained to the Com-
mission that "excluding Generating Units that were not in the 
Service Area of any Responsible Utility from consideration in 
the LARS process could result in higher RMR costs, and 
would be inconsistent with one of the primary goals of the 
LARS process--lowering RMR costs by designating as RMR 
Units those Generating Units that can provide needed RMR 
services at the lowest cost."  The Commission's prior en-
dorsement of the ISO's cost-efficient approach to procuring

61,723-24, accepted a compliance filing permitting Commission re-
view of decisions of the ISO's internal Revenue Review Panel or, 
alternatively, allowing non-jurisdictional participating transmission 
owners to voluntarily submit their proposed rates for Commission 
review.  93 F.E.R.C. at 61,287-89.  Then, pursuant to the rate 
review procedures established in the TAC Cases, the Commission 
reviewed the City of Vernon's voluntarily submitted municipal 
utility rate proposal.  City of Vernon, 93 F.E.R.C. at 61,285-86.  
The Commission's decision to review the rates of non-jurisdictional 
entities seeking to join the ISO ensures that non-jurisdictional 
entities join the ISO on the same terms as jurisdictional utilities 
that are participating transmission owners.  Cf. id. at 61,286.

RMR service along with its orders approving various aspects 
of the ISO's RMR operations, rebut CALPUC's suggestion 
that the Commission has been lax in approving Amendment 
22.

     Finally, there is no basis for CALPUC's contention that the 
Commission's reliance on s 206, Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator 
Corp., 90 F.E.R.C. at 62,042, is misplaced.  In approving 
formula rates, the Commission has relied on s 206 as a 
mechanism to ensure that the rates are just and reasonable, 
see, e.g., Wisc. Pub. Serv. Corp., 69 F.E.R.C. at 61,829 n.15;  
Yankee Atomic Elec. Co., 60 F.E.R.C. p 61,316, at 62,096 
(1992), and its reliance on s 206 has survived judicial scruti-
ny.  See La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FERC, 688 F.2d 357, 361 
(5th Cir. 1982);  cf. La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 174 F.2d at 230-
31.  In suggesting that the ISO has expressed the view that 
s 206 review would be limited to challenging the allocation of 
RMR costs, CALPUC takes the ISO's statement out of 
context.  When the ISO made that statement before the 
Commission, it was responding to concerns that had been 
raised about the ISO's allocation proposal.  Because relief can 
be sought pursuant to s 206 in the event a pass through of 
non-jurisdictional RMR contract costs results in unjust and 
unreasonable rates, the Commission's acceptance of the ISO's 
formula rate without additional s 205 filings does not leave 
CALPUC or ratepayers without any statutory recourse.8

     Accordingly, we deny the petition.

     8  Having failed to raise before the Commission the issue of the 
ISO's being a non-profit with no money to pay refunds in a s 206 
proceeding, CALPUC cannot do so here.  See 16 U.S.C. s 825l(b);  
see also Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maint. 
Trust v. FERC, 876 F.2d 109, 112-13 (D.C. Cir. 1989).
