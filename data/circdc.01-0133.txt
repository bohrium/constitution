                            ---------

     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Ginsburg and Tatel, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge Edwards.

     Edwards, Chief Judge:  In United States v. Fields, 242 F.3d 
393 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("Fields I"), issued on March 13, 2001, 

the sentences of defendants Thomas "Woozie" Fields and 
Bernard "Tadpole" Johnson were vacated and the case was 
remanded to the District Court for resentencing.  The Gov-
ernment now petitions for rehearing, claiming that Fields I 
misapplied Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), in 
holding "the jury was required to find beyond a reasonable 
doubt that defendants were responsible for the quantity of 
drugs attributed to them for purposes of determining their 
base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines."  Govern-
ment's Pet. for Reh'g at 1.  We agree that there is some loose 
language in Fields I which can be read to exceed the bounds 
of the Supreme Court's holding in Apprendi.  We therefore 
grant the Government's petition for rehearing so that we may 
clarify the court's holdings in Fields I.

                             * * * *

     In Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that, "[o]ther than 
the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the 
penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maxi-
mum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt."  530 U.S. at 490.  Therefore, as we held in 
Fields I, it "follows that drug quantity is an element of the 
offense where a factual determination of the amount of drugs 
at issue may result in a sentence that exceeds a maximum 
sentence prescribed in the applicable statute."  242 F.3d at 
395 (emphasis in original).  Apprendi therefore applies to 
sentences predicated on drug quantity where progressively 
higher statutory maximums are triggered by findings of 
progressively higher quantities of drugs.  Id. at 396;  In re 
Sealed Case, No. 00-3057, 2001 WL 409116, at *2 (D.C. Cir. 
Apr. 24, 2001).  Thus, as noted in Fields I, in drug cases 
charged under 21 U.S.C. ss 841 and 846, where the pre-
scribed statutory maximum depends upon the amount of 
drugs involved, before a defendant can be sentenced to a 
higher statutory maximum, "the Government must state the 
drug type and quantity in the indictment, submit the required 
evidence to the jury, and prove the relevant drug quantity 
beyond a reasonable doubt."  242 F.3d at 396.

     Fields I goes awry in suggesting that Apprendi also applies 
to a Sentencing Guidelines enhancement that results in a 
sentence within the statutory range.  For example, Fields I 
states that "[t]he Government was required to convince the 
jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants pos-
sessed enough of a controlled substance for the District Court 
to adjust the base offense level to 38," id. at 397, and that 
"the issue of leadership [role] must be charged in an indict-
ment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt."  Id. at 398.  These passages overstate the holding of 
Apprendi.  As this court recently has held, Apprendi does 
not apply to sentencing findings that elevate a defendant's 
sentence within the applicable statutory limits.  See In re:  
Sealed Case, 2001 WL 409116, at *2-*3.  In other words, 
Apprendi does not apply to enhancements under the Sentenc-
ing Guidelines when the resulting sentence remains within 
the statutory maximum.  This understanding of Apprendi is 
shared by our sister circuits.  See, e.g., United States v. Caba, 
241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001);  United States v. Jackson, 
240 F.3d 1245, 1249 (10th Cir. 2001);  United States v. Garcia, 
240 F.3d 180, 182-84 (2d Cir. 2001);  United States v. 
Williams, 235 F.3d 858, 862-63 (3d Cir. 2000);  United States 
v. Doggett, 230 F.3d 160, 166 (5th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 
S. Ct. 1152 (2001);  Talbott v. Indiana, 226 F.3d 866, 869-70 
(7th Cir. 2000).  Any language to the contrary in Fields I is in 
error and is not the law of this circuit.

     With these legal principles in mind, we will now reconsider 
our application of the law to the facts in Fields I.

                             * * * *

     The Government concedes that, under Apprendi, the Dis-
trict Court committed plain error in this case in imposing life 
sentences on the drug conspiracy count in the absence of jury 
findings as to drug quantity.  The Government claims, howev-
er, that in assessing whether this constituted reversible error 
under the plain error doctrine,"[t]he right question" is wheth-
er there was "overwhelming proof" that defendants' crimes 

involved 50 or more grams of cocaine base, or 1 kilogram or 
more of phencyclidine ("PCP") mixture, or at least 1,000 
kilograms of marijuana.  Government's Pet. at 10.  The 
Government is right as to the amounts of drugs required by 
statute to authorize a life sentence, but wrong in its claim that 
the District Court relied on "overwhelming proof" that the 
conspiracy involved these amounts.

     As noted in Fields I, defendants Fields and Johnson were 
convicted on 40 and 16 counts, respectively, including convic-
tions for Narcotics Conspiracy (Count 1), RICO Conspiracy 
(Count 3), and kidnaping, gang rape, and attempted murder 
(Counts 12-18).  At defendants' sentencing hearing, the Dis-
trict Court adopted the calculations in the Presentence Inves-
tigation Report ("PIR"), as well as the Government's pro-
posed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and found that 
"well above" a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated 
that 1,670 grams of crack cocaine, 11,388 grams of PCP, and 
3,490 kilograms of marijuana were "directly attributable to 
defendant Thomas Fields."  United States v. Fields, Crim. 
No. 98-071-01, Mem. Op. at 16 (D.D.C. Oct. 8, 1999).  The 
District Court also found that 1,670 grams of crack, 11,328 
grams of PCP, and 2,182 kilograms of marijuana were "rea-
sonably foreseeable and part of jointly undertaken activity by 
defendant Johnson, and therefore are appropriately attribut-
able to him."  United States v. Johnson, Crim. No. 
98-071-06, Mem. Op. at 8 (D.D.C. Oct. 13, 1999).  The life 
sentences imposed on defendants were predicated on these 
calculations.  It is undisputed, however, that these drug 
quantities were never proven to a jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt;  indeed, most of the asserted quantities are not based 
on any concrete proof.  While the jury verdict form required 
specified findings that defendants distributed specific quanti-
ties of controlled substance in connection with Count 2 (Con-
tinuing Criminal Enterprise), the jury deadlocked on this 
count in the case of both defendants.  In short, the jury did 
not make any finding at all as to the amount of drugs 
involved, let alone a finding that defendants possessed, be-
yond a reasonable doubt, enough of a controlled substance to 

impose a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. s 841.  The life 
sentences therefore contravened Apprendi.

     Though the District Court erred in imposing the life sen-
tences based on drug quantity, neither defendant objected at 
trial to the failure to submit drug quantity to the jury.  At 
sentencing, defendants objected only on the grounds that the 
calculations were speculative and based on trial testimony of 
various individuals who had entered into agreements with the 
Government.  Hence, as noted in Fields I, our review is for 
plain error.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);  United States v. Wolff, 
195 F.3d 37, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  We may exercise our 
discretion to correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) only 
when an "error" is "plain" or "obvious" under current law, 
affects substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness, 
integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  John-
son v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997);  United 
States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-35 (1993).

     The Government argues that, although the life sentences 
imposed on defendants based on drug quantities resulted in 
plain error, no relief is warranted because the error did not 
affect defendants' substantial rights.  We disagree.  The 
Government maintains that the District Court correctly de-
termined that the quantity of drugs involved exceeded the 
amount required under the applicable provision of 
s 841(b)(1).  However, the Government has no good basis 
upon which to rest such a claim.  The District Court relied 
heavily on the imprecise testimony of various witnesses who 
were cooperating with the Government.  In its petition for 
rehearing, the Government once again points to this testimo-
ny as well as admissions from Fields that he "made a living 
selling crack," sold or supplied marijuana to ten named 
individuals, "worked selling marijuana four to five days a 
week," and "had no idea how much marijuana he had sold."  
Government's Pet. at 10 n.4.  Apart from this vague testimo-
nial evidence, the only other "evidence" to which the Govern-
ment can point is that provided by a DEA chemist who 
testified to the chemical analysis of approximately 7 grams 
(i.e., .007 kilograms) of cocaine base and over twenty kilo-
grams of marijuana that had been seized in the case.  Id.  

This evidence is far from "overwhelming proof" that defen-
dants' crimes involved the drug quantities necessary to trig-
ger a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. s 841(b)(1)(A).  And 
given the gravity of the sentence and the lack of any "over-
whelming" evidence to support it, we have no basis for 
concluding that the error did not "seriously affect[ ] the 
fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed-
ings."  Johnson, 520 U.S. at 469-70.

                             * * * *

     The Government argues, in the alternative, that defendants 
should not prevail under the plain error standard, because the 
life sentence on the RICO conspiracy count was a "statutorily 
available sentence" under Apprendi.  In support of this claim, 
the Government cites United States v. Meshack, 225 F.3d 556, 
577 (5th Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom. Parker v. United 
States, 121 S. Ct. 834 (2001), amended on reh'g, 244 F.3d 367 
(5th Cir. 2001), in which the court held that even if a 10-year 
sentence on a marijuana count was unlawful under Apprendi, 
there was no plain error warranting reversal where the 
defendant was not challenging a greater 324-month concur-
rent sentence on another count.  The decision in Meshack 
was based on the court's conclusion that the defendant would 
receive no meaningful benefit from having his infirm sentence 
vacated, because he would not serve less time as a result of 
resentencing, and no collateral consequences would flow from 
the court's failure to correct the sentence.  244 F.3d at 368.

     The "concurrent sentence" thesis enunciated in Meshack is 
premised on the fact that, quite apart from the infirm sen-
tence, there was an unchallenged and longer concurrent 
sentence on a different count.  In this case, the Government 
asserts that, because the District Court could have sentenced 
defendants to life based on the jury conviction for armed 
kidnaping, defendants' challenges to the life sentences im-
posed on the drug conspiracy count do not warrant reversal 
for plain error.  In other words, the Government says that, 
by finding defendants guilty of Racketeering Act 21, which 
alleged an armed kidnaping under the D.C. Code, the jury 

found all of the facts needed to make life a statutorily 
available sentence as to the RICO conspiracy count.

     The problem with the Government's argument is that, 
although it is true that the District Court imposed concurrent 
life sentences on the RICO conspiracy count, there is no clear 
finding by the trial court that it intended to impose life 
sentences under RICO for Racketeering Act 21 (i.e., armed 
kidnaping).  Indeed, the Government does not suggest other-
wise.  The Government's entire argument rests on the claim 
that there is a possibility of a life sentence on the RICO 
conspiracy count, because of the defendants' convictions for 
armed kidnaping.

     The Government may be correct that life is a "statutorily 
available sentence" on the RICO conspiracy count;  but this is 
a far cry from Meshack, which involved a concurrent sentence 
based on known and uncontested grounds.  In this case, we 
cannot comprehend the District Court's basis for the life 
sentences on the RICO conspiracy count and "[w]e will not 
permit our result to be guided by idle speculation as to the 
sentence that might be imposed by the district court on 
remand."  United States v. Jones, 235 F.3d 1231, 1238 (10th 
Cir. 2000);  see also United States v. Bradford, No. 99-3018, 
2001 WL 363912 (8th Cir. Apr. 13, 2001).  Accordingly, we 
remand to afford the District Court the opportunity in the 
first instance to recalculate the defendants' sentences in a 
manner consistent with our decision here and in Fields I.  On 
remand, the Government will be free to argue to the District 
Court that life sentences should be imposed on the RICO 
conspiracy count premised on the defendants' convictions for 
armed kidnaping.

                             * * * *

     With respect to leadership enhancement, the Government 
is correct that Fields I incorrectly holds that Apprendi 
applies to enhancements based on role-in-offense findings 
under the Guidelines.  A finding of leadership role can raise a 
defendant's offense level under the Guidelines and the result-
ing sentence;  it cannot, however, elevate that sentence above 

the applicable statutory maximum.  Indeed, the Guidelines 
themselves recognize as much.  See U.S. Sentencing Guide-
lines Manual s 5G1.1 (1998).  Thus, a leadership enhance-
ment based on a role-in-offense finding is not a "fact that 
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed 
statutory maximum."  See, e.g., United States v. Gallego, No. 
97-5293, 2001 WL 369783, at *4 (11th Cir. Apr. 13, 2001);  
Caba, 241 F.3d at 101;  Jackson, 240 F.3d at 1249.

                             * * * *

     In sum, Fields I is clarified as indicated above.  The case is 
hereby remanded to the District Court for resentencing 
consistent with this opinion.
