     Before:  Williams, Rogers and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  PMD Produce Brokerage Corpora-
tion challenges the dismissal, as untimely, of its appeal of an 
administrative law judge's decision that it violated the Perish-
able Agricultural Commodities Act, 7 U.S.C. 
ss 499a-s ("PACA").1  PMD contends that the Secretary of 
Agriculture's Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicato-
ry Proceedings, see 7 C.F.R. ss 1.142(c), 1.145(a) (2000), are 
ambiguous regarding the time to appeal and, further, that it 
reasonably relied on statements of the Administrative Law 
Judge and the Hearing Clerk regarding the deadline for filing 
an administrative appeal.  Because ss 1.142(c) and 1.145(a) 
are ambiguous, as confirmed by contrary interpretations 
within the Department of Agriculture, we hold that the 
Secretary did not give fair notice of his interpretation of 
s 1.142(c)(2) as requiring an appeal to be filed within 30 days 
of issuance of an administrative law judge's oral decision.  
Accordingly, because the Secretary was arbitrary and capri-
cious in dismissing PMD's appeal, we grant the petition.

                                I.

     The Secretary, acting through the Associate Deputy Ad-
ministrator, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, Agricultural 
Marketing Service, filed an administrative complaint on No-
vember 16, 1998, alleging that PMD had violated s 2(4) of 
PACA, 7 U.S.C. s 499b(4), by willfully failing repeatedly to 
make full payment promptly to 18 sellers of 633 lots of 
perishable agricultural commodities that it had purchased and 
received.  On November 12, 1999, the Department filed a 
motion for a bench decision, a proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, and a proposed order, in accordance with 
s 1.142(b) of the Secretary's Rules of Practice, 7 C.F.R. 
s 1.142(b).2  After hearing testimony, the Administrative

D-99-0004 (Dep't of Agric. March 31, 2000);  In re PMD Brokerage 
Corp., PACA Docket No. D-99-0004, 2000 WL 202696 (Dep't of 
Agric. Feb. 18, 2000).

     2  Section 1.142(b) provides, in relevant part:

Law Judge orally announced his decision.  The Judge found 
that PMD had violated PACA and recommended revocation 
of PMD's license as a dealer and merchant of perishable 
agricultural products under PACA, 7 U.S.C. ss 499c, 499h(a).  
The Judge directed that his decision and order be published 
pursuant to the Rules of Practice and stated:  "This decision 
will become final without further proceedings 35 days after 
service of this decision, unless [PMD] appeals this decision, 
pursuant to section 1.145 of the Rules of Practice (7 C.F.R. 
s 1.145)."  The Judge thereafter excerpted his oral decision 
and filed the written excerpt on November 30, 1999.

     By letter dated December 1, 1999 to PMD's counsel, the 
Hearing Clerk enclosed "a copy of the Bench Decision, issued 
... on November 30, 1999."  The letter stated that "[e]ach 
party has thirty (30) days from the service of this decision 
and order in which to file an appeal to the Department's 
Judicial Officer."  The letter also instructed PMD "to consult 
s 1.145 of the Uniform Rules of Practice (7 C.F.R. s 1.145) 
for the procedure for filing an appeal."

     On January 7, 2000, PMD filed with the Department's 
Judicial Officer a petition seeking reversal of the Judge's 
decision, and, alternatively, a new hearing.  Following receipt 
of the Department's response, the Judicial Officer denied 
PMD's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The Judicial Officer, 
relying on ss 1.142(c)(2) & (4) of the Rules of Practice, found 
that the Judge's oral decision was issued on November 17, 
1999 and became effective 35 days thereafter, on December 
22, 1999.  Because PMD's appeal was not filed before the 
decision became effective, the Judicial Officer ruled that he 
lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, citing Department 
precedent under the Rules of Practice.3  Because he lacked 

__________
     Prior to the Judge's decision, each party shall be afforded a 
     reasonable opportunity to submit for consideration proposed 
     findings of fact, conclusions, order, and brief in support thereof.
     
7 C.F.R. s 1.142(b) (2000).

     3  The Judicial Officer noted that the Secretary's interpretation 
of his Rules of Practice, treating time limits as jurisdictional, is 
consistent with the judicial construction of Federal Rule of Appel-

jurisdiction to hear PMD's appeal, the Judicial Officer issued 
an order that the Judge's oral decision of November 17, 1999 
was the final administrative order.  The Judicial Officer 
denied PMD's petition for reconsideration.

                               II.

     On appeal, PMD contends that the Secretary's Rules of 
Practice, specifically ss 1.142(c)(4) and 1.145(a), are internally 
inconsistent.4  The ambiguity arises, PMD maintains, because 
the Rules of Practice do not indicate that "issuance" of an 
oral decision under ss 1.142(c)(2) and (4) is to be considered 
"receiving service" under s 1.145(a).  PMD points out that 
s 1.142(c)(4) provides that an oral decision becomes effective 
35 days after issuance, while s 1.145(a) provides that a party 
has 30 days after "receiving service" of the Judge's decision 
to appeal.  "Clearly," PMD contends, "receiving service of 
the Judge's decision is a form of notice of entry requirement, 
that requires serving a copy of the written decision on the 
parties before the time to appeal begins to run."  In addition, 
PMD contends that it reasonably relied on the statements by 
the Judge and the Hearing Clerk that the Judge's opinion did 
not become effective until 35 days after service because they 
would not intentionally misinform a party about the time to 
appeal.  The court reviews the Secretary's decision dismiss-
ing PMD's appeal to determine whether it was arbitrary, 
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-
dance with law.  See 5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A).

late Procedure 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(5)(A) and the Administrative Orders 
Review Act, see 28 U.S.C. s 2344, as interpreted in Illinois Central 
Gulf Railroad Co. v. ICC, 720 F.2d 958, 960 (7th Cir. 1983).  See 
Kidd v. District of Columbia, 206 F.3d 35, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2000);  
Energy Probe v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 872 
F.2d 436, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1989);  see also Marine Mammal Conser-
vancy, Inc. v. USDA, 134 F.3d 409, 410-11 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

     4  Although PMD's brief refers to s 1.142(a)(4), there is no such 
subsection and it is obvious that PMD intends to refer to 
s 1.142(c)(4).

     The Secretary states that he has consistently interpreted 
the Rules of Practice to divest the Judicial Officer of jurisdic-
tion to hear an appeal of an administrative law judge's 
decision that has become effective.  See, e.g., In re Toscony 
Provision Co., 43 Agric. Dec. 1106, 1108-09 (Dep't of Agric. 
1984) (order denying late appeal) and Department orders 
cited.  Further, he states that PMD had actual notice from 
the Judge's oral ruling on November 17, 1999 that his deci-
sion would be final in 35 days unless an appeal was filed 
pursuant to s 1.145.  Having failed to file an appeal before 
December 22, 1999, the Secretary maintains that PMD's 
contention that the court should disregard the jurisdictional 
nature of s 1.142(c)(4) is meritless.  In other words, although 
not expressly stated in his Rules of Practice, the Secretary 
has interpreted "issuance" of an oral decision under 
s 1.142(c)(4) to mean "receiving service" for purposes of 
s 1.145(a).

     The Secretary explains, in his brief on appeal, that the 
bench decision procedures of s 1.142 are designed to allow 
expedited proceedings in disciplinary cases where the viola-
tion is so patent that "the usual opportunity for the parties to 
submit written findings of fact and conclusions of law is 
unnecessary."  Under these circumstances, the Secretary 
contends, "[n]o good reasons exist for delaying the imposition 
of the order of the [J]udge."  Perhaps not.  Indeed, on the 
basis of this rationale, the court could readily view the 
Secretary's interpretation of s 1.142(c)(4) as reasonable.  Cf. 
Veg-Mix, Inc. v. USDA, 832 F.2d 601, 608-09 (D.C. Cir. 
1987).  The question before the court, however, is not wheth-
er the Secretary's interpretation of the Rules of Practice is 
reasonable, but whether the Secretary has given fair notice of 
his interpretation that "issuance" of an oral opinion pursuant 
to s 1.142(c)(2) is "receiving service" for purposes of taking 
an appeal under s 1.145(a).  See United States v. Chrysler 
Corp., 158 F.3d 1350 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Rollins Envtl. Servs. 
(NJ) Inc. v. EPA, 937 F.2d 649 (D.C. Cir. 1991);  Gates & Fox 
Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 790 
F.2d 154 (D.C. Cir. 1986).

     The dismissal of PMD's appeal implicates the Secretary's 
obligation to give fair notice because the sanction of dismissal 
of its appeal petition as untimely forecloses relief from revo-
cation of its license under PACA.  In Satellite Broadcasting 
Co. v. FCC, 824 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the court explained:

     Traditional concepts of due process incorporated into 
     administrative law preclude an agency from penalizing a 
     private party for violating a rule without first providing 
     adequate notice of the substance of the rule.  The dis-
     missal of an application, we have held, is a sufficiently 
     grave sanction to trigger this duty to provide clear 
     notice.
     
Id. at 3 (citations omitted).  In that case, an applicant for 
FCC licenses had failed to file its application in the proper 
location.  See id. at 2-3.  The court observed that the rules, 
taken as a whole, were conflicting.  Id. at 2.  Thus, while an 
"agency's interpretation [of its own rule] is entitled to defer-
ence, [ ] if it wishes to use that interpretation to cut off a 
party's right, it must give full notice of its interpretation."  
Id. at 4.  Because the FCC had not provided fair notice of its 
interpretation of the relevant rules, the court held that it had 
acted arbitrarily and capriciously in dismissing the license 
applications, and that the applicant was entitled to reinstate-
ment of the applications nunc pro tunc.  See id.

     Similarly, in General Electric Co. v. EPA, 53 F.3d 1324 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), the court deferred to the agency's reasonable 
interpretation of its rules but held that the agency could not 
fine a private party for failure to comply with a rule interpre-
tation that was "so far from a reasonable person's under-
standing of the regulations that [the regulations] could not 
have fairly informed GE of the agency's perspective."  Id. at 
1330.  Most recently, in Trinity Broadcasting of Florida, Inc. 
v. FCC, 211 F.3d 618 (D.C. Cir. 2000), the court rejected the 
agency's contention that its regulation requiring an entity to 
be "minority-controlled," id. at 628, provided fair notice of its 
interpretation of the regulation as mandating that non-profit 
organizations demonstrate de facto minority control and not 
simply a majority-minority board.  See id. at 625, 628-30.  
The court likewise rejected the agency's contentions that 
agency statements and other agency action provided fair 
notice of its interpretation.  See id. at 628-31.  Therefore, the 

court reversed the denial of an application for renewal of a 
broadcast license.  See Trinity Broad., 211 F.3d at 632.

     Here, the question is whether the Secretary's rules gave 
PMD fair notice of the time within which it had to appeal the 
Judge's decision.5  Two sections of the Secretary's Rules of 
Practice are implicated.  Section 1.142, addressing when an 
Administrative Law Judge's decision becomes effective, pro-
vides in relevant part:

     The Judge's decision shall become effective without fur-
     ther proceedings 35 days after the issuance of the deci-
     sion, if announced orally at the hearing, or if the decision 
     is in writing, 35 days after the date of service thereof 
     upon the respondent, unless there is an appeal to the 
     Judicial Officer by a party to the proceeding pursuant to 
     s 1.145;  Provided, however, that no decision shall be 
     final for purposes of judicial review except a final deci-
     sion of the Judicial Officer upon appeal.
     
7 C.F.R. s 1.142(c)(4) (2000) (emphasis added).6  Section 
1.145, addressing appeals, provides in relevant part:

__________
     5  On appeal, the Secretary has abandoned the Judicial Officer's 
alternative position, in denying reconsideration, that PMD's appeal 
was untimely because it was filed 31 days after PMD was furnished 
a copy of the Bench Decision by the Hearing Clerk. PMD claims 
first, that it did not receive the Bench Decision until December 7, 
1999, and second, that under agency precedent, the Judicial Officer 
can grant an extension of time "if an appeal [i]s inadvertently filed 
up to 4 days late, e.g., because of a delay in the mail system...."  
In re Scamcorp, Inc., 55 Agric. Dec. 1395, 1996 WL 678862, at *6 
(Dep't of Agric. Nov. 7, 1996);  see also id. at *7.

     6  Section 1.142 also provides:

     If the [Administrative Law Judge's] decision is announced 
     orally, a copy thereof, excerpted from the transcript or record-
     ing, shall be furnished to the parties by the Hearing Clerk.  
     Irrespective of the date such copy is mailed, the issuance date 
     of the decision shall be the date the oral decision was an-
     nounced.
     
7 C.F.R. s 1.142(c)(2) (2000).

     Within 30 days after receiving service of the Judge's 
     decision, a party who disagrees with the decision, or any 
     part thereof, or any ruling by the Judge or any alleged 
     deprivation of rights, may appeal such decision to the 
     Judicial Officer by filing an appeal petition with the 
     Hearing Clerk.
     
7 C.F.R. s 1.145(a) (2000) (emphasis added).

     As the Secretary points out, ss 1.142(c)(2) & (4) clearly 
describe when a Judge's opinion, whether oral or written, 
becomes effective.  Similarly, s 1.145(a) clearly states there 
is a 30-day period within which to appeal the Judge's deci-
sion.  But the triggering event under s 1.145(a) is "receiving 
service," and the Rules of Practice at no point state that 
"issuance" of an oral opinion under s 1.142(c)(2) is deemed 
"receiving service" for purposes of s 1.145(a).  In other 
words, the Secretary's Rules of Practice are silent regarding 
whether "issuance" of an oral decision under s 1.142(c)(2) is 
"receiving service" for purposes of noting an appeal under 
s 1.145(a).  Thus, PMD could not simply read the Rules of 
Practice and know that this was so.  Nor would the purpose 
of expedition, which the Secretary asserts is the underlying 
rationale for the procedures in s 1.142(c), compel an interpre-
tation of the regulations, much less give fair notice, that 
"issuance" is to be equated with "receiving service" under 
s 1.145(a).  Cf. Trinity Broad., 211 F.3d at 629-30.  At oral 
argument, the Secretary agreed that the period after which 
an opinion becomes effective is different from the period in 
which a party may note an appeal.

     Of course, the Secretary may utilize means other than the 
language of his Rules of Practice to give adequate notice of 
his interpretation.  See, e.g., General Elec., 53 F.3d at 1329.  
However, the Secretary points to no action, such as public 
statements or pre-enforcement efforts, that would have in-
formed PMD of the Secretary's interpretation.  Instead, the 
statements by the Judge and the Hearing Clerk demonstrate 
that the Rules of Practice were ambiguous regarding the time 

period for appealing an oral bench decision.  See id. at 1330-
32.  Each statement erroneously referred to "service" as the 
event triggering the 30-day appeal period and, consequently, 
neither statement informed PMD that the appeal period had 
been triggered by the Judge's oral issuance of his opinion on 
November 17, 1999.  Such statements, it could be argued, 
justify application of a "unique circumstances" exception.  
Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc. v. Fitch, 966 F.2d 981, 984-86 
(5th Cir. 1992) (construing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a));  cf. Moore v. 
South Carolina Labor Bd., 100 F.3d 162, 164 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  
Under the unique circumstances doctrine, "appellate courts 
will excuse an untimely notice of appeal where the appellant 
could have filed a timely notice but was mislead to delay filing 
by a court order or ruling which purportedly extended or 
tolled the appeal deadline."  Id. at 163.

     In denying PMD's petition for reconsideration, the Judicial 
Officer made three principal points.  First, he noted that 
PMD had been furnished with a copy of the Secretary's Rules 
of Practice, which are also published in the Federal Register, 
and that PMD's reliance on the statement of the Hearing 
Clerk was "misplaced."  Yet the Rules themselves were, at 
best, unclear on the critical point for PMD.  The lack of 
clarity was exacerbated by the Judge's statement, which 
appeared to be consistent with the statement of the Hearing 
Clerk.

     Second, the Judicial Officer emphasized that the only deci-
sion issued by the Judge was announced at the November 17, 
1999 hearing.  The written Bench Decision later received by 
PMD was merely an excerpt from the transcript of the earlier 
hearing. Hence, the Judicial Officer concluded that the refer-
ence to "this decision" in the Judge's Bench Decision fur-
nished to PMD, as well as the references in the Hearing 
Clerk's December 1, 1999 letter, were all references to the 
oral decision issued on November 17, 1999.  The Judicial 
Officer also recognized, however, that the references to the 
Judge's decision were "not without ambiguity."  Further, the 
fact that the only decision in the case was the Judge's oral 
decision begs the question.  The question is whether the 
Rules of Practice, or other action by the Secretary, provided 

fair notice of which event--"issuance" or "receiving ser-
vice"--triggered the appeal time under s 1.145(a).

     Third, the Judicial Officer found that the statements by the 
Judge and the Hearing Clerk that the decision would become 
effective 35 days after service, rather than after issuance, 
were "error" because the only decision in the case was the 
oral decision issued on November 17, 1999.  Acknowledging 
further that there was an ambiguity in the statements made 
to PMD by the Judge and the Hearing Clerk because both 
failed to distinguish between the November 17, 1999 oral 
decision and the written Bench Decision when informing 
PMD of the period to appeal, the Judicial Officer nevertheless 
appeared to conclude that a simple reading of the Rules of 
Practice sufficed to give fair notice to PMD.  In that regard, 
for reasons already discussed, he erred.  Moreover, any 
similarity between the Secretary's interpretation of s 1.145(a) 
as a jurisdictional bar and judicial construction of Federal 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 and the Administrative Orders 
Review Act, 28 U.S.C. s 2344, as presenting jurisdictional 
bars to untimely appeals, see supra n.3, does not address 
whether the Secretary provided fair notice of his interpreta-
tion of s 1.142(c).

     Accordingly, because neither the Secretary's Rules of Prac-
tice nor any other action by the Secretary provided fair notice 
to PMD that "issuance" of the Judge's oral decision under 
s 1.142(c) was "receiving service" for purposes of noting an 
appeal under s 1.145(a), we grant the petition.
