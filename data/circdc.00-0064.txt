Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  The Washing-
ton Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) appeals 
judgments rendered against it in a suit brought by Judy J. 
Jones alleging discriminatory and retaliatory refusal to pro-
mote, discharge and failure to reinstate in violation of the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. ss 621 
et seq., and of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 
U.S.C. ss 2000e et seq.  The district court awarded Jones 
compensatory and liquidated damages under the ADEA, pur-
suant to a jury verdict, and reinstatement, back pay (includ-
ing prejudgment interest) and retroactive promotion under 
Title VII.  In addition, the court awarded attorney's fees and 
injunctive relief under each statute.  WMATA challenges the 
both the ADEA and the Title VII judgments.  We vacate the 
ADEA damage award because WMATA is immune from 
liability therefor under the Eleventh Amendment to the Unit-
ed States Constitution.  We affirm the Title VII award in 
toto.

     Jones began working for WMATA as a bus driver in 1974 
and in 1984 rose to the position of first-line TS-3 rail opera-
tions supervisor (TS-3) in WMATA's Department of Rail 
Service (Department).  This dispute began on June 18, 1985 
when Jones and four subordinates wrote a letter to Fady 
Bassily, WMATA assistant general manager in charge of the 
Department, complaining of employment discrimination 
against "white women."  Joint Appendix (JA) 254.  At Bassi-
ly's direction, Mark Miller, then his general deputy, and John 
Kirin, the Department's third ranking employee, met with 

Jones on August 6, 1985.  According to Jones, during their 
meeting Miller told her that her job was "in jeopardy" and 
asked her to resign.  JA 400.

     In 1986 the Department promoted several other TS-3 
supervisors to a newly created TS-4 position.  According to 
WMATA personnel records, Jones was "disqualified" from 
consideration because of a "recent disciplinary action."  JA 
293.

     In January 1987 a screening panel recommended Jones and 
thirteen other employees for promotion to TS-4.  Kirin, who 
had switched positions with Miller, rejected the panel's list of 
candidates and asked Miller to draft a new one, taking into 
account factors he believed the panel had not adequately 
considered.  Jones's name did not appear on Miller's list.  In 
a letter to Jones dated October 30, 1987 Miller cited as 
reasons for not recommending her promotion:  (1) her "mar-
ginal" score on a written exam and (2) her failure to follow 
WMATA policies and procedure, specifically by "trans-
mit[ting] [her] personal views to [her] subordinates, (when in 
conflict with those of the Authority)," which he characterized 
as "unprofessional," and by giving a customer a cash refund 
from a farecard machine "contrary to station policy."  JA 
305.1

     Meanwhile, on September 11, 1987 Jones filed a complaint 
with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission 
(EEOC) alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, 
age and sex and retaliation.

     In September 1988 Jones again applied for a TS-4 position.  
The panel, headed by Miller, who was aware of Jones's 
pending EEOC claim, again rejected her despite her high 
ratings on objective job criteria.  At trial, Miller indicated she 
was not recommended because she did "very, very poorly" 
during her interview.  JA 558.

__________
     1 Also in 1987 Jones applied unsuccessfully for promotion to a 
TS-5 position as Quality Assurance Inspector.  She claimed below 
that her rejection resulted from gender discrimination.  This claim 
is not at issue on appeal.

     On March 1, 1989 Jones filed this lawsuit alleging discrimi-
natory and retaliatory failure to promote in violation of Title 
VII and the ADEA.  After her lawyer became ill the lawsuit 
"stalled" until she retained new counsel in February 1991.  
Jones v. WMATA, 946 F. Supp. 1023, 1029-30 (D.D.C. 1996).

     On March 6, 1991 Jones was directed to meet with Allen 
Brown, one of Bassily's deputies, who was investigating a 
recent employee protest in which Jones had participated.  
Brown had previously questioned Jackie Rhodes, one of 
Jones's subordinates, at great length about the protest, press-
ing for information about Jones's role in it.  Familiar with 
Rhodes's experience, Jones refused to meet Brown without 
her lawyer and subsequently refused a request from Miller as 
well to meet in his office.  After a confrontation with Miller in 
the lunch room, Jones called her division superintendent, Al 
Yorro, to tell him she was going home sick.  Later that 
afternoon Jones received a call at home from Yorro, directing 
her to report for a medical examination by 6:00 p.m., which 
she did.  Following the exam, Aubrey Burton, General Super-
intendent of the Department's Rail Transportation office, 
recommended to Bassily that Jones be fired, after consulting 
with WMATA's personnel director and its Office of General 
Counsel.  Bassily approved the discharge and signed Jones's 
termination form on March 7, 1991.  In a certified letter to 
Jones, Brown identified as the cause for Jones's discharge 
"insubordination" in refusing orders to meet with Miller and 
himself.  JA 252-53.  After unsuccessfully requesting rein-
statement in a letter to WMATA's Office of General Counsel, 
Jones amended her complaint to claim retaliatory discharge 
and failure to reinstate.

     On August 6, 1993 the district court granted partial sum-
mary judgment in favor of Jones on her claim of retaliatory 
failure to reinstate in violation of both Title VII and the 
ADEA.  The court reserved "[t]he issue of appropriate relief 
for this claim" to "be tried together with the remaining claims 
in this case."  JA 74.

     The ADEA claims were tried before a jury in October 1994.  
On October 20, 1994 the jury returned a verdict awarding 
Jones $50,000 in compensatory damages on the ADEA retali-

ation claims--$10,000 for the 1988 failure to promote to TS-4 
and $20,000 each for the termination and failure to reinstate 
in 1991.  In addition, the jury found that the ADEA violations 
were willful.  Accordingly, the district court immediately 
entered a judgment on the verdict in the amount of $50,000.

     In an opinion and order filed October 15, 1996 the court 
also found for Jones on three of her Title VII claims:  retalia-
tory failure to promote both in 1987 (in retaliation for signing 
the 1985 letter complaining of discrimination) and in 1988 (for 
filing the 1987 EEOC complaint) and retaliatory discharge in 
1991 (for filing and prosecuting the Title VII lawsuit).2  At 
the same time, in accord with its own findings and with the 
jury's, the court entered a final judgment ordering the follow-
ing relief:  (1) reinstatement and retroactive promotion to TS-
4 effective October 1, 1987 under both the ADEA and Title 
VII;  (2) back pay under Title VII (consisting of the difference 
between what Jones was actually paid after October 1, 1987 
and what she would have been paid at the TS-4 level) plus 
prejudgment interest;  (3) liquidated damages under the 
ADEA, 29 U.S.C. s 626(b) (equal to the back pay owed after 
February 2, 1989, the date the jury found Jones was "willful-
ly" deprived of the TS-4 promotion);  (4) a permanent injunc-
tion prohibiting WMATA "from taking any form of retaliatory 
action against Jones for engaging in activity protected by 
Title VII or the ADEA";  and (5) "reasonable" expenses and 
attorney's fees.  946 F. Supp. at 1032-34.

                               II.

     WMATA has challenged the district court's judgments on 
various grounds but, in light of the posture of the case and of 

__________
     2 The court decided the Title VII claims, based on evidence 
presented in a short bench trial as well as the evidence submitted 
both during and before the jury trial, because the acts giving rise to 
Jones's claims occurred before the effective date of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. s 1981a(c), which first authorized jury trials 
for such claims.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244 
(1994).

our disposition, we need address only three of them.  We 
discuss each separately.

                      A. Sovereign Immunity

     We first consider WMATA's contention that state entities 
(including WMATA) are immune under the Eleventh Amend-
ment from ADEA liability.  Because the United States Su-
preme Court recently resolved this question in favor of 
immunity,3 we agree that the ADEA damages awards must 
be vacated.

     Under the Eleventh Amendment, " 'an unconsenting State 
is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own 
citizens as well as by citizens of another State.' "  Morris v. 
WMATA, 781 F.2d 218, 222-23 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting 
Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974)).  "Moreover, 
though the immunity is that of the state, 'some agencies 
exercising state power have been permitted to invoke the 
Amendment in order to protect the state treasury from 
liability that would have had essentially the same practical 
consequences as a judgment against the State itself.' "  Id. at 
223 (quoting Lake Country Estates v. Tahoe Regional Plan-
ning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 400-01 (1979)).  WMATA was 
created by a compact enacted by the Congress and to which 
the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland and the 
District cf Columbia are signatories.  We have consistently 
recognized that in signing the WMATA Compact, Virginia 
and Maryland each conferred its immunity upon WMATA, 
which therefore enjoys, to the same extent as each state, 
immunity from suit in federal court based on its performance 
of governmental functions.4  See, e.g., Morris v. WMATA, 

__________
     3 After oral argument we ordered this appeal held in abeyance 
pending the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Bd. of 
Regents, which issued on January 11, 2000 and which we discuss 
infra.

     4 The WMATA Compact provides:

     The Authority shall be liable for its contracts and for its torts 
     and those of its Directors, officers, employees and agents 
     
supra;  Souders v. WMATA, 48 F.3d 546, 548 (D.C. Cir. 
1995);  Beebe v. WMATA, 129 F.3d 1283, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 
1997);  see also Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 
U.S. 30, 52, 50 n.20 (1994) (noting "decision in Morris is 
compatible with our approach" to determining multi-state 
authority's Eleventh Amendment immunity vel non).  We 
have also held that WMATA's "governmental function" immu-
nity encompasses "the hiring, training, and supervision of 
WMATA personnel," which is the kind of conduct for which 
Jones seeks to hold WMATA liable under the ADEA.  See 
Burkhart v. WMATA, 112 F.3d 1207, 1217 (D.C. Cir. 1997);  
accord Beebe v. WMATA, supra.  The determinative question 
therefore is whether, as Jones has argued, in enacting the 
ADEA the Congress abrogated the states' (and consequently 
WMATA's) Eleventh Amendment immunity from ADEA lia-
bility.  Since oral argument, the United States Supreme 
Court has definitively answered this question in the negative.  
In Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000), the 
Court held that, although the ADEA contains a statement of 
congressional intent to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amend-
ment immunity, the attempted abrogation exceeds the Con-
gress's authority under s 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  
Under Kimel, therefore, we conclude the ADEA award of 
compensatory and liquidated damages against WMATA must 
be vacated because its "practical result ... would be payment 
from the treasuries of Maryland and Virginia."  Morris, 781 
F.2d at 225.5

WMATA Compact, Pub. L. No. 89-774, s 80, 80 Stat. 1324, 1350 
(1966).

     5 Because we vacate the ADEA awards based on the jury's 
verdict, we need not address WMATA's objections to the admissibil-
ity of certain evidence (namely evidence of the entry of partial 
summary judgment, of the discrimination judgment against WMA-
TA in Townsend v. WMATA, 746 F. Supp. 178 (D.D.C. 1990), and of 
WMATA's alleged discrimination against several witnesses), or its 

                      B. Title VII Judgment

     We next address WMATA's challenge to the district court's 
Title VII judgment.  WMATA contends that the evidence 
does not support the court's findings that WMATA unlawfully 
retaliated against Jones in 1987 and in 1988 when it failed to 
promote her and in 1991 when it discharged her.6  We must 
uphold the district court's factual findings unless they are 
clearly erroneous.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a);  see also Pullman-
Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 290 (1982).  We perceive no 
clear error here.

     Under the framework laid out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), Jones was required first to 
establish a prima facie case of retaliation by demonstrating 
that "(1) [she] engaged in protected activity, (2) [she] was 
subjected to adverse action by the employer and (3) there 
existed a causal link between the adverse action and the 
protected activity."  Thomas v. National Football League 
Players Ass'n, 131 F.3d 198, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing 
Mitchell v. Baldrige, 759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  Such 

__________
challenges to the court's failure to instruct the jury that Jones was 
not entitled to have her lawyer present during attempted interviews 
preceding her discharge and that as a supervisor Jones did not 
engage in protected activity when she signed the 1985 letter to 
Bassily.

     6 Although the court expressly made the latter two findings "in 
reliance upon the verdict of the jury on Jones' ADEA claim," in 
each case the court also "note[d] that it would have reached the 
same conclusion independent of the jury, based upon the filings and 
oral argument of counsel, and the testimony and other evidence in 
the record." 946 F. Supp. at 1029, 1030.  On the 1987 promotion 
claim, the court "ma[de] its findings under Title VII independent of 
the jury's determinations under the ADEA."  Id. at 1028. On 
Jones's claim of failure to reinstate, we need not resolve WMATA's 
challenge to the district court's summary judgment since the only 
relief it supports--reinstatement and back pay--would have been 
awarded in any event under the court's wrongful discharge finding, 
which we uphold and which the district court made clear "would be 
the same even in the absence of the summary judgment determina-
tion."  946 F. Supp. at 1030.

a showing raises a "rebuttable presumption of unlawful dis-
crimination" and shifts to the defendant the burden to "rebut 
the presumption by asserting a legitimate, non-discriminatory 
reason for its actions."  Id. (citing Texas Dep't of Community 
Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981)).  If the defen-
dant meets this burden of production, "the presumption of 
discrimination dissolves" and the plaintiff assumes the burden 
"to persuade the trier of fact that the defendant's proffered 
reason was not the actual or sole basis for the disputed 
action."  Id.

     On the 1987 promotion claim, WMATA does not dispute 
that Jones established a prima facie case, as the district court 
found, but does contend that Jones failed to rebut as pretex-
tual WMATA's proffered legitimate reasons for not promot-
ing Jones.  We conclude the evidence supports the district 
court's finding of pretext.  Of the three reasons Miller of-
fered in his October 30, 1987 letter for not promoting Jones, 
the district court reasonably rejected as pretextual two:  
Jones's "marginal" test score, because it was higher than the 
score of another employee who was promoted, and the in-
stance when she gave a cash refund to a customer, because 
the court found her action consistent both with the Metrorail 
Handbook and with a Department directive.  946 F. Supp. at 
1028.  In contrast, the court accepted Miller's third reason, 
that Jones had "transmit[ted] [her] personal views to [her] 
subordinates," as "more plausible--but violative of Title VII" 
because it reflected retaliation for protected activity, namely, 
the 1985 letter to Bassily complaining of Department discrim-
ination.  Because the court's findings of pretext and of retali-
ation as to the promotion claim are supported by the evi-
dence, they are not clearly erroneous.

     We also reject WMATA's contention that there is no record 
evidence that those responsible for firing Jones were aware 
she had hired new counsel in January 1991, thereby reinvigo-
rating her dormant lawsuit and prompting a retaliatory dis-
charge.  See JA 138-39.  In its opinion denying WMATA's 
post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district 
court noted the undisputed fact that Department members, 
including Bassily, knew that the lawsuit was pending and that 

WMATA's Office of General Counsel was aware she had 
retained new counsel who had successfully had the suit 
restored to the court's active docket.  Jones v. WMATA, 946 
F. Supp. 1011, 1022 (D.D.C. 1996);  see also JA 581-87.  
Further, Rhodes testified that Brown asked her about Jones's 
lawyers when he questioned her one week before the firing, 
JA 477, and Bassily testified that before recommending 
Jones's discharge Burton consulted with WMATA's Office of 
General Counsel, which "concurred" in the dismissal.  JA 628.  
This evidence supports the court's finding that WMATA 
decision makers fired Jones with knowledge she had retained 
new counsel.

     Finally, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to find 
pretextual WMATA's claim it fired Jones for "insubordina-
tion" in violation of Department procedure, namely for refus-
ing orders to meet with Brown and Miller.  As evidence of 
pretext, the court cited Jones's willingness to meet with 
Yorro, WMATA's own violation of its procedures in firing her 
without affording her an opportunity to explain her behavior 
and other instances of unlawful retaliation by Department 
management, both against Jones in connection with her 1987 
and 1988 promotion denials and against other employees who 
had complained of discrimination, see 946 F. Supp. at 1026.  
This evidence suffices.

                     C. Prejudgment Interest

     Finally, WMATA claims Eleventh Amendment immunity 
from the court's award of prejudgment interest on the back 
pay award.  Relying on Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 
U.S. 310 (1986), WMATA maintains that, because Title VII 
does not expressly waive the states' immunity from prejudg-
ment interest, they retain their Eleventh Amendment immu-
nity from such awards.  WMATA's reliance is misplaced.  In 
Shaw the Supreme Court held that the "no-interest rule," 
under which interest can be awarded against the United 
States only pursuant to an express waiver of immunity from 
interest, forecloses recovery of an enhanced attorney fee 

award in a Title VII action against the United States.7  The 
Court has since made clear that abrogation of the states' 
Eleventh Amendment immunity does not require the same 
level of specificity.  In Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274 
(1989), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment does not 
bar enhancement of an attorney's fees award against states 
under 42 U.S.C. s 1988 to compensate for delay, noting that 
Shaw had "equated compensation for delay with prejudgment 
interest."  Id. at 282 n.3.  Shaw's "observations" about pre-
judgment interest, the Court explained, "cannot be divorced 
from the context of the special 'no-interest rule' that was at 
issue in Shaw" and "[t]hat rule, which is applicable to the 
immunity of the United States and is therefore not at issue 
here, provides an 'added gloss of strictness' only where the 
United States' liability for interest is at issue." 491 U.S. at 
282 n.3 (quoting Shaw, 478 U.S. at 318).  Because the no-
interest rule does not apply to state liability, we see no bar to 
awarding pre-judgment interest on back pay assessed against 
a state under Title VII, as to which the Congress expressly 
and effectively abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity, see 
Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), and which has long 
been recognized, in the absence of immunity, to authorize 
prejudgment interest as part of its back pay remedy, see 
Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U.S. 549, 557 (1988).  Accord Pegues v. 
Mississippi State Employment Serv., 899 F.2d 1449 (5th Cir. 
1990) ("Congress has the power under section 5 of the 
Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate the state's immunity to 
enforce the Amendment's protections. Congress exercised 
this power in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964.") (foot-
note omitted).8  We therefore affirm the district court's 

__________
     7 Since Shaw was decided, the Congress has added to Title VII an 
express waiver of immunity from interest.  42 U.S.C. s 2000e-
16(d).

     8 Because we vacate the ADEA liquidated damages award, we 
need not address WMATA's argument that awarding both liqui-
dated damages and prejudgment interest provides a "double recov-
ery."

award of prejudgment interest on the Title VII back pay 
award.9

     For the preceding reasons, we vacate the plaintiff's awards 
of compensatory, and liquidated damages under the ADEA 
and affirm the relief awarded under Title VII--including 
reinstatement, promotion, back pay, prejudgment interest, 
injunctive relief and expenses and attorneys fees.  According-
ly, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this 
decision.

                                                      So ordered.
