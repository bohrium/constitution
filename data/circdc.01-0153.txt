     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  This case presents questions aris-
ing from the Supreme Court's opinion in Apprendi v. New 
Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), including the impact of Apprendi 
on the interpretation of the career offender provision of the 
United States Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1.  Den-
nis Webb appeals from his conviction on three counts of 
distributing and one count of possessing with intent to dis-
tribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. s 841.  Webb 
contends that because a judge, rather than a jury, determined 
facts concerning drug quantity and prior criminal convictions, 
his sentence was imposed in violation of both the Constitution 
and the Sentencing Guidelines.  For the reasons discussed 
below, we reject those challenges.  We also reject Webb's 
subsidiary claims that the trial court erred in failing to credit 
him with accepting responsibility for his offenses, in admit-
ting evidence of Webb's prior drug transactions, and in 
denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a 
search of his apartment.

                                I

     In the spring of 1998, the government began investigating 
Webb for his suspected involvement in dealing cocaine base 
("crack" cocaine) in Washington, D.C., and for his ties to a 
New York drug supplier.  The government recruited Danon 
Johnson, a convicted drug dealer with whom Webb previously 
had done business, to arrange several controlled purchases 
from Webb.  Webb sold Johnson cocaine base on May 14, 18, 
and 28, 1998.  Each of these transactions was preceded by 
negotiations that were recorded on audiotape.  The first two 
transactions took place in Johnson's apartment;  the third 
transpired in a government car and was recorded on video 
and audiotape.  Government laboratory reports showed that 
the quantity of cocaine base purchased on these occasions was 
22.5, 34.7, and 53.5 grams, respectively.  Following the sales, 
on July 28, 1998, a federal grand jury handed down a sealed 

indictment charging Webb with three counts of distributing 
cocaine base.

     The government's investigation into Webb resumed on 
September 3, 1998, when investigators asked Johnson to 
attempt another purchase from Webb.  Johnson contacted 
Webb, but Webb told Johnson that he did not have any crack 
for sale.  Soon thereafter, the government obtained a search 
warrant for Webb's apartment, seeking documents related to 
Webb's drug business.  The search warrant was executed on 
September 15, 1998, and investigators found 6.52 grams of 
crack, $15,114 in cash, drug packaging supplies, and a piece of 
paper with the name and pager number of the New York 
supplier sought by the government.

     On December 3, 1998, a four-count superseding indictment 
was filed against Webb.  The indictment charged him with 
one count of distribution for each of the three May drug 
purchases:  Counts One and Two each charged Webb with 
distributing 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 
21 U.S.C. s 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii), and Count Three 
charged him with distributing 50 grams or more of cocaine 
base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. s 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).  A 
fourth count, relating to the drugs seized from his apartment, 
charged Webb with possessing with intent to distribute a 
detectable amount of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 
s 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).

     Webb's case went to trial on April 27, 1999.  Webb filed 
pretrial motions to bar the government from introducing 
evidence of his past drug transactions with Johnson, and to 
suppress evidence collected from the search of his apartment.  
The district court denied both motions.  At trial, the govern-
ment's evidence included the testimony of Johnson, as well as 
that of investigators who surveilled the transactions between 
the two men and who participated in the search.  A govern-
ment chemist testified and introduced lab reports that speci-
fied the weight of the cocaine base recovered from each 
transaction and the search.  Webb neither testified nor pre-
sented witnesses in his defense.

     Consistent with then-prevailing precedent in this circuit, 
the trial court did not instruct the jury that it must find the 
drug quantities recited in the indictment;  instead, it instruct-
ed that "the government need not prove that the defendant 
distributed any particular numerical amount of cocaine, but it 
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant 
distributed a detectable or measurable amount of cocaine."  
4/29/99 Tr. at 48.  Similarly, the jury verdict form did not 
specify quantities for any of the charges.  See App. 202.  On 
May 4, 1999, the jury convicted Webb on all counts.

     Based upon the presentence report ("PSR"), the district 
court found that Webb had two prior felony drug convictions, 
that he was on parole for one at the time of the offenses 
charged in the indictment, that the quantities of cocaine base 
involved in the indictment's four counts were as specified 
above, and that the total quantity was 116.82 grams.1  This 
would ordinarily have given Webb a criminal history category 
of IV and an offense level of 32, which would have fixed his 
sentencing range at 168 to 210 months.  See U.S.S.G. 
s 2D1.1(c)(4);  id. s 4A1.1(a), (d);  id. ch. 5, Pt. A.  However, 
because of his two prior narcotics convictions, Webb qualified 
as a career offender.  See U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1.2  Under the 
career offender guideline, Webb received a criminal history 
category of VI and an offense level of 37.  PSR p 18.  These 
figures exposed Webb to a sentencing range of 30 years to 

__________
     1  The PSR apparently made a mathematical error in totalling 
drug quantity;  the total should have been 117.22 grams.

     2  Section 4B1.1 provides that:  "A defendant is a career offend-
er if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time 
the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction, (2) the 
instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of 
violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has 
at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or 
a controlled substance offense."  U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1.  If a defendant 
meets these criteria, his offense level is determined by using a table 
set forth in s 4B1.1--if the table produces a higher offense level 
than that which the defendant would otherwise receive under the 
guidelines.  Id.  All defendants qualifying as career offenders re-
ceive a criminal history Category of VI.  Id.

life.  See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.  On August 13, 1999, the court 
sentenced Webb to 30 years' imprisonment and 10 years of 
supervised release.

                                II

     Webb's principal challenge to his sentence is that it is 
contrary to the rule announced in Apprendi, that "any fact 
that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed 
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt."  530 U.S. at 490.  Specifically, 
Webb first contends that, because the jury merely found him 
responsible for a detectable amount of cocaine base and made 
no findings concerning his prior convictions, his 30-year 
sentence exceeds the 20-year maximum constitutionally au-
thorized by the jury's findings.  See 21 U.S.C. s 841(b)(1)(C).  
Second, Webb contends that even if his sentence of 30 years 
did not exceed the lawful maximum, the district court commit-
ted error by sentencing him, under the career offender 
provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1, to a 
sentence greater than that justified by the jury's determina-
tion alone.  We consider these contentions in Parts B through 
D below.  We begin with an explication of the relevant 
statutory provisions, and with a discussion of the case law 
leading to, and following from, the Supreme Court's opinion 
in Apprendi.

                                A

     Section 841(a) of Title 21 of the United States Code makes 
it "unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally" to 
distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled 
substance.  Section 841(b) specifies sentences for "any person 
who violates subsection (a)."  For violations involving cocaine 
base, s 841(b) establishes three categories of penalties, de-
pending upon the amount of the drug involved:  s 841(b)(1)(A) 
sets a maximum sentence of life in prison for violations 
involving 50 grams or more;  s 841(b)(1)(B) sets a maximum 
sentence of 40 years for violations involving 5 grams or more 
(or life, if the defendant has a prior felony drug conviction);  

and s 841(b)(1)(C) sets a maximum sentence of 20 years for 
any other amount (or 30 years, if the defendant has a prior 
felony drug conviction).3

     Until 2000, well-established precedent in this circuit held 
that drug quantity was a sentencing factor to be determined 
by the trial court by a preponderance of the evidence, and not 
an element of the s 841 offense to be determined by a jury 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Williams, 194 F.3d 100, 102 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  United States v. 
Lam Kwong-Wah, 966 F.2d 682, 685 (D.C. Cir. 1992);  United 
States v. Patrick, 959 F.2d 991, 995-96 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  
That precedent was consistent with the rule in the other 
circuits.  See Lam Kwong-Wah, 966 F.2d at 685 (collecting 
cases).  The fact of a defendant's prior conviction was also 
treated as a sentencing factor and, in Almendarez-Torres v. 
United States, the Supreme Court confirmed that prior con-
viction could constitutionally be determined by a judge rather 
than a jury.  523 U.S. 224, 226-27 (1998).  In accord with this 
precedent, standard practice in the district court was for the 
judge at sentencing, rather than the jury at trial, to make the 
necessary findings about drug quantity and prior conviction.  
This was the procedure the district court followed in Webb's 
case.

     In Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227 (1999), the Supreme 
Court considered the statute that makes carjacking a federal 
crime, 18 U.S.C. s 2119.  That statute has a tripartite struc-
ture, with a base penalty of imprisonment for a maximum of 
15 years, and greater penalties dependent upon whether the 
offense involved the injury or death of a victim.  The Court 
suggested that it could well be unconstitutional for Congress 
to remove those latter determinations from a jury's consider-
ation, pursuant to the principle that "under the Due Process 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial 
guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than 

__________
     3  Section 841(b)(1)(A) and (B) establish different quantity 
thresholds for other drugs.  They also establish mandatory mini-
mum sentences, but Webb raises no claim concerning the mandato-
ry minimum penalties on this appeal.  See generally United States 
v. Camacho, 248 F.3d 1286, 1288-89 & n.5 (11th Cir. 2001).

prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a 
crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, 
and proven beyond a reasonable doubt."  Jones, 526 U.S. at 
243 n.6.  To avoid doubt about the constitutionality of s 2119, 
the Court construed the statute "as establishing three sepa-
rate offenses by the specification of distinct elements, each of 
which must be charged by indictment, proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict."  
Id. at 252.

     The next Term, the Supreme Court decided Apprendi v. 
New Jersey.  Confirming what the Court said it had "fore-
shadowed" in Jones, Apprendi held that due process requires 
that, "[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that 
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed 
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt."  530 U.S. at 476, 490.  Such a 
fact, the Court said, was the "functional equivalent of an 
element of a greater offense than the one covered by the 
jury's guilty verdict."  Id. at 494 n.19.  In Apprendi, the 
defendant had pled guilty to a state firearms charge that 
exposed him to a sentencing range of 5 to 10 years' imprison-
ment.  Id. at 469-70.  However, pursuant to a separate state 
statute enhancing punishment for hate crimes, a defendant's 
maximum sentence could be increased to 20 years if the 
sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, 
that the offense was motivated by racial bias.  Id. at 470.  
The judge made that finding and sentenced Apprendi to 12 
years' imprisonment.  Id. at 471.  The Supreme Court held 
this sentence unconstitutional, because it exceeded the statu-
tory maximum for the firearms offense based upon the 
judge's factfinding concerning racial bias.

     Apprendi contained two important caveats.  First, the 
Court confirmed that Almendarez-Torres was still good law, 
and hence that a judge rather than a jury could continue to 
determine whether a defendant had prior convictions, regard-
less whether that determination increased the defendant's 
sentence above a statutory maximum.  Id. at 489-90.  The 
Court added, however, that it is "arguable that Almendarez-
Torres was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application 

of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue 
were contested."  Id.  Second, the Court made clear that it 
was not suggesting "that it is impermissible for judges to 
exercise discretion--taking into consideration various factors 
relating both to offense and offender--in imposing a judg-
ment within the range prescribed by statute."  Id. at 481.  In 
so doing, Apprendi expressly preserved the holding of 
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79 (1986), that sentenc-
ing factors that determine where a defendant's sentence falls 
within a statutory maximum need not be proven to a jury.
Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13, 494 & n.19.  Indeed, the
Court suggested that it would be permissible for a legislature
to set a crime's maximum sentence at, 34for example, 50 years
and [to] giv[e] judges guided discretion as to a few specially
selected factors within that range.34 Id. at 490 n.16.

     Apprendi did not address the interpretation or constitu-
tionality of  s 841.   Apprendi itself involved two 34separate
statute[s].34  Id. at 468-69.  One fixed a 10-year maximum
sentence for possessing a firearm for an unlawful purpose.
The other--the hate crime law--increased the maximum sen-
tence for any crime (with certain exceptions) where a judge
found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant
committed the offense out of racial bias.  Id. Section 841, by
contrast, is a single statute with two subsections.  One   sub-
section, s 841(a), is entitled "Unlawful acts" and specifies that 
it is unlawful to knowingly or intentionally distribute a con-
trolled substance.  The other, s 841(b), is entitled "Penalties" 
and specifies three categories of sentences for "any person 
who violates subsection (a)."  See s 841(b)(1)(A), (B), (C).4  
Following the logic of Apprendi, if s 841 were interpreted as 
a unitary statute--establishing a single crime with a statutory 
maximum of life in prison and three sentencing factors depen-
dent upon drug quantity--then drug quantity in a particular 
case may be decided by a judge.  However, if s 841 were 
interpreted as a tripartite statute--establishing three sepa-

__________
     4  Section 841(b) includes a fourth category, s 841(b)(1)(D), 
which applies to offenses involving (inter alia) less than 50 kilo-
grams of marijuana and which is not applicable here.

rate crimes with three different statutory maxima depending 
upon the drug quantity categories of s 841(b) (hereinafter the 
(A), (B), and (C) offenses)--then the drug quantity thresholds 
effectively are elements that must be decided by a jury.

     Since Apprendi was decided, numerous circuits have held 
that Apprendi requires that the drug quantity thresholds of 
s 841(b) be treated as offense elements and thus "charged in 
the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt."  United States v. Promise, No. 99-4737, 2001 WL 
732389, at *5 (4th Cir. June 29, 2001).5  In several cases, 
including the instant case, the government has conceded the 
point.  Br. for Gov't at 11-12.6  Subsequent to the oral 
argument in this case, another panel of this court agreed, 
holding in United States v. Fields that, "[i]n light of Appren-
di, it is now clear that, in drug cases under 21 U.S.C. ss 841 
and 846, before a defendant can be sentenced to any of the 
progressively higher statutory maximums that are based on 
progressively higher quantities of drugs specified in subsec-
tions 841(b)(1)(A) or (B), the Government must state the drug 
type and quantity in the indictment, submit the required 
evidence to the jury, and prove the relevant drug quantity 
beyond a reasonable doubt."  United States v. Fields, 242 
F.3d 393, 396 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("Fields I"), aff'd and amended 
on reh'g, 251 F.3d 1041, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("Fields II");

1282 (11th Cir. 2000);  United States v. Meshack, 225 F.3d 556, 575 
(5th Cir. 2000).

     7  Although failure to follow these requirements constitutes er-
ror, it is not reversible error if it is either "harmless" under Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) or not "plain" under Federal Rule 

Fields also held, however, that "Apprendi does not apply to 
enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines when the 
resulting sentence remains within the statutory maximum."  
Fields II, 251 F.3d at 1043-44;  see United States v. King, No. 
00-3023, 2001 WL 739813, at *4 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2001);  In 
re Sealed Case, 246 F.3d at 698-99;  see also Fields II, 251 
F.3d at 1044 (collecting cases from other courts of appeals).  
These holdings are now the law of the circuit.

     As will be evident in our discussion below, in order to 
decide this case it is important to know whether s 841 is 
properly interpreted as a unitary (one crime with a life 
maximum) or tripartite (three crimes with three increasing 
maxima) statute.  The defendant argues that it is the latter.  
Although the Fields court did not explicitly address the 
question, it must have understood s 841 to be tripartite.  
Otherwise, and contrary both to Fields' holding and to the 
government's concession in this case, drug quantity would not 
need to be decided by a jury because a judge's determination 
would not increase the penalty beyond the prescribed statuto-
ry maximum--life imprisonment.8  Accordingly, the question 
of the statute's structure is not open for us to consider de 

__________
of Criminal Procedure 52(b).  See Fields II, 251 F.3d at 1045;  infra 
Parts II.B-D.

     8  In her dissent in Apprendi, Justice O'Connor wrote that 
"[t]he actual principle underlying the Court's decision may be that 
any fact (other than prior conviction) that has the effect, in real 
terms, of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise 
applicable range must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt."  530 U.S. at 543-44 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).  
Such a principle, Justice O'Connor said, would also apply "to all 
determinate-sentencing schemes in which the length of a defen-
dant's sentence within the statutory range turns on specific factual 
determinations (e.g., the federal Sentencing Guidelines)."  Id. at 
544.  But this expansive reading of Apprendi would effectively 
overrule McMillan, a step the majority expressly stated it was not 
taking.  See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13.  As noted above, this 
circuit has taken a narrower view of the meaning of Apprendi.  See 
Fields II, 251 F.3d at 1043-44;  In re Sealed Case, 246 F.3d at 698-
99.

novo, and we therefore accept for purposes of our analysis 
that it is tripartite, without examining the indicia of legislative 
intent ourselves.

                                B

     Webb's first challenge to his sentence is that, because the 
jury did not determine drug quantity, he may not lawfully be 
sentenced to a term greater than that authorized for the (C) 
offense--the only one of the three s 841(b) offenses for which 
drug quantity is not an element.  See 21 U.S.C. 
s 841(b)(1)(C);  United States v. Allen, 960 F.2d 1055, 1058 
(D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that s 841(b)(1)(C) is satisfied if the 
defendant's violation involves "any detectable amount" of 
cocaine base).  Further contending that the maximum sen-
tence under the (C) offense is 20 years' imprisonment, Webb 
argues that, in light of Apprendi, he should not have been 
sentenced to any more than 20 years.

     Webb did not raise this objection below, and the parties 
agree that as a consequence we must review it under the 
four-pronged plain error standard of Federal Rule of Crimi-
nal Procedure 52(b).  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);  Fields II, 
251 F.3d at 1045;  In re Sealed Case, 246 F.3d at 698.  Under 
that standard, "before an appellate court can correct an error 
not raised at trial, there must be (1) 'error,' (2) that is 'plain,' 
and (3) that 'affect[s] substantial rights.' "  Johnson v. United 
States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997) (quoting United States v. 
Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).  "If all three conditions are 
met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to 
notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error 'seriously 
affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings.' "  Id. at 467 (additional internal quotations and 
citations omitted).  In evaluating whether an error is "plain" 
in a case like Webb's, where the law has changed since the 
time of the trial, "it is enough that an error be 'plain' at the 
time of appellate consideration."  Id. at 468.

     The problem with Webb's claim to a 20-year maximum 
sentence is that, although the basic (C) violation is subject to 
a 20-year cap, the statute provides that "[i]f any person 
commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony 

drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced 
to a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 years."  21 
U.S.C. s 841(b)(1)(C).  Moreover, as discussed above, in Al-
mendarez-Torres the Supreme Court expressly held that an 
enhancement for prior convictions need not be based on a 
jury's finding--a holding the Court preserved in Apprendi.  
See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 ("Other than the fact of a prior 
conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime 
beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted 
to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." (emphasis 
added)).  Webb nonetheless notes the skepticism about Al-
mendarez-Torres expressed in Apprendi, and asks us to 
disregard the earlier case because he counts five Justices as 
no longer supporting its holding.  That, of course, we may not 
do.  See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) ("[I]f a 
precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet 
appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of 
decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which 
directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of 
overruling its own decisions." (internal quotation omitted)).  
Thus, taking into consideration the district court's recidivism 
finding, Webb faced a maximum sentence of 30 years even if 
he had been convicted of the (C) offense alone.  And because 
he was only sentenced to 30 years, Webb was not sentenced, 
as he claims, to a term greater than the statutory maximum 
of s 841(b)(1)(C).

                                C

     If this case were not complicated by the application of the 
career offender guideline, the fact that the defendant received 
a sentence within the statutory maximum of the (C) offense 
might well end the analysis, notwithstanding that a judge 
rather than a jury made a quantity determination that could 
have exposed the defendant to a higher maximum.  In such 
cases, some courts of appeals have held that, because the 
defendant was sentenced below (C)'s maximum, there was no 
"Apprendi error" at all.9  Such an approach seems appropri-

     9  See, e.g., United States v. Angle, No. 96-4662, 2001 WL 
732124, at *2 (4th Cir. June 29, 2001);  United States v. Meshack, 
225 F.3d at 576.

ate where the defendant was charged with and convicted of 
the (C) offense (or with an unspecified s 841(b) offense not 
based on quantity).  In such a case, drug quantity is not an 
element of the offense that must be decided by a jury, and 
the defendant's sentence was determined by the Sentencing 
Guidelines' drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(c), which 
assigns offense levels based on drug quantities rather than 
statutory maxima.10

     Other courts of appeals have found "Apprendi error" where 
the trial court determined a drug quantity that would qualify 
the defendant for an enhanced maximum sentence, but have 
concluded that the error did not "affect substantial rights," 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 52, because the defendant's actual sentence 
fell below the maximum for the (C) offense.11  This approach 
is appropriate where the defendant, like Webb, was charged 
with and convicted of the (A) or (B) offense.  See App. 11-12 
(indictment);  App. 216 (judgment of conviction).  In such a 
case, there is error because an element of the offense (the 
quantity threshold) was not submitted to the jury.  See 
Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.  Such an error does not affect the 
defendant's substantial rights, however, because the applica-
tion of the Sentencing Guidelines' drug quantity table result-
ed in the same guidelines sentence the defendant would have 
received had he only been convicted of (C).

     But Webb's case presents an additional complication.  Be-
cause of his two prior felony convictions, Webb was not 

__________
     10  The drug quantity table assigns a defendant a base offense 
level depending upon the type and quantity of the drug involved in 
his offense.  For example, the drug quantity table assigns a base 
offense level of 32 to a crime involving at least 50 but less than 150 
grams of cocaine base.  See U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(c)(4).  For a person 
with Webb's criminal history category of IV (prior to application of 
the career offender guideline), this results in a sentencing range of 
168 to 210 months--notwithstanding the statutory maximum of 360 
months for an offense involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base.  
See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.

     11  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Guizar, 234 F.3d 483, 488 
(9th Cir. 2000);  United States v. Heckard, 238 F.3d 1222, 1235 (10th 
Cir. 2001).

sentenced under the drug table but instead under the career 
offender guideline, U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1.  See supra note 2.  
Unlike the former, which determines offense level based upon 
drug quantity, the latter determines a defendant's offense 
level based upon his "offense statutory maximum," which is 
defined as the "maximum term of imprisonment authorized 
for the offense of conviction ... including any increase in that 
maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision 
that applies because of the defendant's prior criminal record."  
U.S.S.G. s 4B1.1, comment. n.2 (emphasis added).  According 
to Guideline s 4B1.1, a career offender convicted of an of-
fense with a statutory maximum of life receives an offense 
level of 37, while a defendant convicted of an offense with a 
maximum of 25 years or more (but not life) receives an 
offense level of only 34.  All career offenders receive a 
criminal history category of VI.

     If the district court had treated Webb as having been 
convicted of the (C) offense, which carries a (recidivist-
enhanced) maximum of 30 years, s 4B1.1 would have as-
signed Webb an offense level of 34.  This level, combined 
with a criminal history category of VI, would have yielded a 
sentencing range of 262 to 327 months--for a maximum 
sentence of 27.25 years.  See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.  However, 
because the district court treated Webb as having been 
convicted of the (A) and (B) offenses, both of which carry 
(recidivist-enhanced) statutory maxima of life, s 4B1.1 as-
signed Webb an offense level of 37.  That level, combined 
with Webb's criminal history category of VI, produced a 
sentencing range of 30 years to life.  Thus, Webb argues, 
although the district court only sentenced him to 30 years, 
that sentence was greater than the sentence he would have 
received had he been convicted of the (C) offense alone.  And 
that, Webb argues, constitutes plain error.  Cf. United States 
v. Camacho, 248 F.3d 1286, 1290 n.7 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding 
that error "occurs when a defendant in a section 841 case is 
sentenced on the basis of [a judge's determination of] drug 
quantity and the sentence cannot logically be construed as a 
section 841(b)(1)(C) sentence").  Accordingly, in order to 
determine whether Webb's sentence passes muster under the 

plain error standard, we must consider whether the district 
court's application of the career offender guideline does so.

                                D

     The government contends that the district court's applica-
tion of Guideline s 4B1.1 was not plain error because it was 
not error at all.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466-67 (noting that 
first prong of plain error standard requires that there be 
"error.")  As the government notes, even after Apprendi and 
Fields, a judge may still make quantity determinations that 
affect sentencing as long as the sentence a defendant receives 
falls within the maximum sentence authorized by 
s 841(b)(1)(C).  The government argues that, subject to this 
cap, a sentencing court can determine the "offense of convic-
tion" (and hence the "offense statutory maximum") within the 
meaning of s 4B1.1 based upon the court's own determination 
of drug quantity--even if the defendant was only properly 
convicted of the (C) offense.

     The government's argument may well support a conclusion 
that any error that was committed here was not "plain":  
courts long thought that the drug thresholds of s 841(b) could 
be determined by judges, and it is plausible that the Sentenc-
ing Commission likewise expected judges to determine the 
meaning of "offense of conviction" based on nothing more 
than their own determinations of drug quantity.  In light of 
this circuit's post-Apprendi decision in Fields, however, we 
conclude that the district court's application of s 4B1.1 was 
nonetheless error.  After Fields, a conviction for the (A) or 
(B) offense is not proper unless the relevant drug threshold 
has been stated in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Fields II, 251 F.3d at 
1043.  Whatever the Sentencing Commission thought consti-
tuted an "offense of conviction" when the guidelines were 
initially promulgated, we are confident that it intended that 
only a conviction that was in accord with governing law would 
qualify.  See United States v. Gilliam, No. 00-2887, 2001 WL 
723008, at *6-7 (7th Cir. June 28, 2001) (finding error where 
court calculated sentence under career offender guideline 
based on judge's determination of drug quantity);  United 
States v. Saya, 247 F.3d 929, 940-42 (9th Cir. 2001) (same);  

United States v. Rogers, 228 F.3d 1318, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 
2000) (holding that without a quantity finding by the jury, the 
"offense statutory maximum" under s 4B1.1 must be that of 
s 841(b)(1)(C)).

     But although the district court committed error in its 
application of s 4B1.1, and even assuming that error were 
plain, Webb's sentence nonetheless survives plain error re-
view under Rule 52(b) because his underlying convictions for 
the (A) and (B) offenses survive such review.  Counts One 
through Three of the indictment expressly charged Webb 
with offenses under s 841(b)(1)(A) and (B), and expressly 
alleged that he distributed 50 grams or more of cocaine base 
on one occasion (Count Three), and 5 grams or more on two 
other occasions (Counts One and Two).  App. 11-12.  Under 
Fields, those quantities constitute elements of the charged 
offenses, and by failing to submit them to the jury, the 
district court erred.  As the Supreme Court directed in 
Johnson, however, we may not "exercise [our] discretion to 
notice" such an error unless the fourth prong of plain error 
review is satisfied:  the error must "seriously affect[ ] the 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed-
ings."  520 U.S. at 469-70;  see Fields II, 251 F.3d at 1045 
(noting that plain error review is applicable to Apprendi error 
and finding plain error);  Gallego, 247 F.3d at 1198 (applying 
plain error review but finding none);  United States v. Nance, 
236 F.3d 820, 824 (7th Cir. 2000) (same).  That prong is not 
satisfied here.12

     In Johnson, the Court considered the validity of Johnson's 
conviction for perjury under 18 U.S.C. s 1623.  The trial 
court, without objection and following then-settled law, had 
instructed the jury that the element of materiality was a 
question for the court to decide, and that it had already 
determined that the statements at issue were material.  After 
Johnson's conviction but before her appeal, the Supreme 

__________
     12  As in Johnson, in light of our conclusion that the trial court's 
error does not satisfy the fourth prong of the plain error standard, 
we need not consider whether it satisfies the third prong:  that the 
error "affec[t] substantial rights."  Johnson, 520 U.S. at 468-69.

Court decided United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 522-23 
(1995), holding that the materiality of a false statement under 
18 U.S.C. s 1001 must be decided by the jury rather than the 
court.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 464.  When Johnson's 
perjury case came before the Supreme Court, it held that the 
trial court had committed error by failing to submit the 
materiality question to the jury.  The Court nonetheless 
sustained the conviction, holding that the error did not affect 
the integrity of the proceeding because the evidence that 
Johnson's false statements were material was "overwhelming" 
and "essentially uncontroverted."  Id. at 470;  cf. Neder v. 
United States, 527 U.S. 1, 17 (1999) (finding that failure to 
submit element of offense to jury was harmless error where 
the "omitted element was uncontested and supported by 
overwhelming evidence").13

     As in Johnson, the evidence of the drug quantities charged 
in Counts One through Three of Webb's indictment was both 
overwhelming and uncontroverted.  Those counts involved 
three separate transactions:  the government alleged that on 
each occasion, Webb sold a quantity of crack to the govern-
ment's cooperating witness.  For the jury to have convicted 
Webb of each of these three incidents, the jurors must have 
believed that Webb engaged in each of the three transactions 
and was responsible for the amounts he provided.  The 
specific amount involved in each transaction was established 

__________
     13  Johnson and Neder both involved a district court's failure to 
submit an element to the jury.  Webb contends that those cases are 
inapplicable here.  He argues that the error in this case was not 
that the district court failed to submit the quantity elements of the 
(A) and (B) offenses to the jury, but rather that the district court 
sentenced Webb as if he had been convicted of (A) and (B) when in 
fact he had only been convicted of (C).  We need not decide 
whether Johnson and Neder would apply where a defendant was 
convicted only of the (C) offense, because in this case the (A) and 
(B) offenses were charged in the indictment and entered in the 
court's judgment of conviction.  Thus, the error here was the 
district court's failure to submit an element (the drug quantity 
thresholds of (A) and (B)) to the jury for determination beyond a 
reasonable doubt--the same error as in Johnson and Neder.

by the testimony and report of a government chemist, and 
was confirmed by tape recordings of conversations between 
Webb and Johnson, in which the two discussed the quantities 
of crack involved in the transactions.  Webb did nothing to 
challenge the evidence of drug quantity at either trial or 
sentencing, and even on appeal offers no scenario under 
which the jury could have convicted him of the transactions, 
yet rationally found that they involved different quantities 
than those testified to by the government chemist.  See 
Nance, 236 F.3d at 826 (finding Apprendi error not plain 
because "[i]f this jury was going to convict [defendant] at all 
... there is simply no way on this record that it could have 
failed to find that he was conspiring to distribute 5 grams or 
more of crack cocaine");  United States v. Swatzie, 228 F.3d 
1278, 1284 (11th Cir. 2000) (same);  cf. Neder, 527 U.S. at 19 
(finding omission of element in jury instructions harmless 
because "defendant did not, and apparently could not, bring 
forth facts contesting the omitted element").14

     Webb contends that he had no reason to contest drug 
quantity below because his trial occurred before Apprendi 
was issued, and hence before the drug quantity thresholds 
were regarded as elements of the s 841 offenses.  But even 
accepting Webb's contention that he had no reason to contest 
quantity at trial,15 he had every incentive to contest it at 

__________
     14  Webb's case is considerably different from that of the defen-
dant in Fields.  In Fields, although the court recognized the 
application of Rule 52(b) to Apprendi error, it did not find "over-
whelming" proof that the quantity of drugs involved exceeded the 
threshold required to authorize a maximum sentence of life impris-
onment under s 841(b).  Fields II, 251 F.3d at 1045.  By contrast 
to Webb's case, in Fields the government had recovered only 7 
grams of cocaine base and 20 kilograms of marijuana (compared to 
50 grams of the former and 1000 kilograms of the latter required to 
authorize a life maximum), and was forced to rely on "imprecise 
testimony" of cooperating witnesses and vague admissions by the 
defendant.  See id. at 1044-45.

     15  But see Williams, 194 F.3d at 102 (noting that defendant--
who was faced with the same pre-Apprendi circuit precedent as 
Webb--argued at trial that drug quantity was an element of a 

sentencing.  The presentence report's recommendations con-
cerning the quantity of drugs involved in Webb's transactions, 
and the district court's adoption of those recommendations, 
dramatically affected Webb's sentencing range.  Yet, while 
Webb "noted one factual inaccuracy" in the presentence 
report regarding an unrelated issue, he did not dispute the 
accuracy of the drug quantities there reported.  PSR at 12 
(noting Webb's objections).  Moreover, whatever his incen-
tives below, Webb surely has an incentive on appeal to 
suggest a scenario under which he could plausibly have 
disputed the drug quantities specified by the chemist.  Even 
now, however, he suggests none.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 
470 (noting that "[b]efore the Eleventh Circuit and in her 
briefing before this Court, petitioner has presented no plausi-
ble argument" that the false statement for which she was 
convicted was not material).

     In sum, because the evidence of drug quantity was over-
whelming and uncontroverted, and because even now Webb 
offers no plausible scenario under which it could be disputed, 
"there is no basis for concluding that the error 'seriously 
affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings,' " and hence no grounds for noticing that error 
under Rule 52(b).  Id.  Webb's convictions for selling 50 or 
more and 5 or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 
U.S.C. s 841(b)(1)(A) and (B), therefore survive plain error 
review and remain intact.  As a consequence, the sentence 
that was based on those convictions would stand even if it had 
exceeded the statutory maximum for the (C) offense.  See 
Nance, 236 F.3d at 826;  Swatzie, 228 F.3d at 1284.16  That 

__________
s 841 offense);  Rogers, 228 F.3d at 1320 (noting that in reliance on 
Jones, defendant argued that drug quantity was an element that 
had to be determined by the jury).

     16  For that reason, we reject Webb's argument (made in a 
footnote) that the district court also imposed an improper term of 
supervisory release, without deciding whether Webb is correct in 
contending that the length of the term imposed is appropriate only 
for a defendant convicted of the (A) offense.  Similarly, our conclu-
sion that the (A) and (B) convictions survive review eliminates any 

result follows a fortiori in a case like this one, in which the 
sentence Webb actually received was below the statutory 
maximum.  See Gilliam, 2001 WL 723008, at *6-7 (affirming 
defendant's sentence, notwithstanding that district court 
erred in applying the career offender guideline as if defen-
dant had been convicted of an (A) offense, because the error 
passed plain error review);  Saya, 247 F.3d at 940-42 (same).

                               III

     Webb raises three additional arguments on this appeal, one 
relating to his sentence and two concerning the validity of his 
convictions.  Only the third requires any extended discussion.

                                A

     Defendant's additional sentencing contention is that the 
district court erred by failing to reduce his offense level by 
two points for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to Sen-
tencing Guideline s 3E1.1.  Because Webb neither sought 
this reduction nor objected to the district court's failure to 
grant it sua sponte, our review is again for plain error.  The 
standard of review is unimportant, however, because the 
district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise.

     The Sentencing Guidelines require a two-point reduction in 
a defendant's offense level "[i]f the defendant clearly demon-
strates acceptance of responsibility for his offense."  U.S.S.G. 
s 3E1.1(a) (emphasis added).  The commentary to this provi-
sion explains that acceptance involves "truthfully admitting 
the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction."  Id., 
comment. n.1(a).17  Webb never did so.  Although upon arrest 

__________
argument (although Webb has made none) that those convictions 
should themselves be vacated because they carry collateral conse-
quences beyond those created by the alleged differential in sen-
tences.

     17  The commentary also states that "[t]his adjustment is not 
intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its 
burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of 
guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses re-

he did waive his Miranda rights and admit to possession of 
the crack found in his apartment and charged in Count Four, 
Webb never admitted to the transactions for which he was 
convicted under Counts One, Two and Three.  During his 
interview with the probation officer who prepared his presen-
tence report, Webb "declined to discuss his involvement" in 
the offenses of conviction.  PSR p 8.  When he stood before 
the judge at sentencing and was asked whether he wished to 
speak, Webb once again declined.  8/13/99 Tr. at 14.  As we 
have said before, "[w]hile the district court lacks the power to 
force a defendant to express remorse he does not feel, it is 
not required to reward a remorseless defendant with a de-
crease in his offense level."  United States v. Dozier, 162 F.3d 
120, 128 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Accordingly, the court did not err 
in failing to reduce Webb's offense level for acceptance of 
responsibility.18

                                B

     Webb also contends that the court erred, under Federal 
Rule of Evidence 404(b), in rejecting his request to bar the 
government's cooperating witness, Danon Johnson, from tes-
tifying about his prior drug transactions with Webb.  See 
Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (governing the admissibility of "[e]vi-

__________
morse."  U.S.S.G. s 3E1.1, comment. n.2.  Although "[c]onviction 
by trial ... does not automatically preclude a defendant from 
consideration for such a reduction," it will be only the "rare 
situation[ ]" in which a defendant goes to trial and receives the 
s 3E1.1 deduction.  Id.  Webb's is clearly not that situation--not 
because he put the government to its proof by going to trial, but 
because (as noted below) even after his conviction he failed either to 
admit guilt or express remorse.

     18  Webb further contends that his failure to accept responsibili-
ty at sentencing was due to the ineffective assistance of his counsel, 
who he claims failed to prepare him properly for the proceeding.  
But nothing in the transcript of the sentencing proceeding suggests 
that it was Webb's lack of preparation, rather than his own recalci-
trance, that caused his failure to accept responsibility.  See 8/13/99 
Tr. at 15 (statement by the sentencing judge that Webb was 
evincing "an attitude ... like it's no big thing").

dence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts").  We need spend 
little time on this point because even if admission of the 
testimony were erroneous, it was also harmless.  See Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 52(a).  The government tape-recorded the conversa-
tions between Webb and Johnson that took place in connec-
tion with the three transactions charged in Webb's indict-
ment.  Those recordings contained numerous references to 
the duo's prior drug transactions, and were admitted into 
evidence without any objection from Webb.  Even on appeal, 
he does not dispute the admissibility of the tapes.  We can 
perceive no material additional harm that Webb suffered as a 
consequence of Johnson's testimony on the same subjects, 
particularly in light of the overwhelming evidence of Webb's 
guilt.  Cf. United States v. Lampkin, 159 F.3d 607, 615 (D.C. 
Cir. 1998) (holding inadmissible hearsay harmless where 
"merely cumulative of other evidence adduced at trial");  
United States v. Walls, 70 F.3d 1323, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1995) 
(holding erroneous Rule 404(b) ruling harmless where evi-
dence against defendant was overwhelming).

                                C

     Finally, we consider Webb's claim that the district court 
erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained 
during the September 15, 1998 search of his apartment.  The 
search was undertaken pursuant to a warrant, which autho-
rized a search for books and records relating to narcotics 
transactions.  It resulted in the seizure of evidence that 
became the basis of Count Four of the indictment, including 
6.52 grams of crack, $15,114 in cash, drug packaging supplies, 
and a piece of paper with the name and pager number of 
Webb's New York supplier.

     Webb argued below and argues here that the warrant was 
issued without probable cause because the affidavit upon 
which it was based recited stale information:  the affidavit was 
sworn and the warrant issued on September 14, 1998, 109 
days after the final drug transaction took place between 
Webb and Johnson on May 28, 1998.  The district court 
denied Webb's motion to suppress, finding that although 

defendant's arguments were "certainly not frivolous," "a rea-
sonable judicial officer could determine that it is likely that a 
person who is engaged in drug selling in May, having not 
been arrested, would continue to be engaged in such activities 
three and a half months later." 4/27/99 Tr. at 5.  Like the 
district court, we give "a determination of probable cause by a 
federal magistrate ... 'great deference.' "  United States v. 
Hubbell, 167 F.3d 552, 559 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Illinois v. 
Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 236 (1983));  see Ornelas v. United States, 
517 U.S. 690, 698-99 (1996).

     We find the issuance of this warrant troubling.  The 
Fourth Amendment provides that "[t]he right of the people to 
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, 
against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable 
cause...."  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  To protect that right, 
the Supreme Court has declared that the facts supporting a 
warrant must be "so closely related to the time of the issue of 
the warrant as to justify a finding of probable cause at that 
time."  Sgro v. United States, 287 U.S. 206, 210 (1932).  Our 
court has interpreted Sgro to mean that although the time 
between the application for a warrant and the discovery of 
the evidence supporting that application is "not controlling," 
it is nonetheless important.  See Schoeneman v. United 
States, 317 F.2d 173, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1963).  In Schoeneman, 
we found no probable cause to believe that classified govern-
ment documents, last seen in the defendant's house 107 days 
before the application for the warrant was made, were still 
present in that house on the date of the application.  Id. at 
177-78.

     In this case, as in Schoeneman, the search warrant sought 
documents, here relating to Webb's alleged drug activity.  
See App. 184-85.  As in Schoeneman, the warrant was issued 
more than 100 days after the government last had direct 
information that there was evidence of criminal activity in the 
defendant's home.  Although the government's application 
included its affiant's statement that those involved in drug 
transactions typically keep records of such transactions in 
their homes, the question remains whether there was proba-

ble cause to believe that such records would still be there four 
months after the last known transaction.

     But even if the affidavit were insufficient to establish 
probable cause, the Supreme Court has held that when police 
officers obtain evidence through a search incident to a war-
rant, "suppression is appropriate only if the officers ... could 
not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the 
existence of probable cause."  United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 
897, 926 (1984);  see United States v. Maxwell, 920 F.2d 1028, 
1034 (D.C. Cir. 1990).19  On that standard, suppression is 
inappropriate in this case.  Although Schoeneman concluded 
that 107-day-old evidence was too stale to support probable 
cause in that case, the evidence there consisted solely of an 
informant's statement that he had seen classified documents 
in the defendant's home on that single occasion.  Schoene-
man, 317 F.2d at 175-77.  Here, by contrast, the affidavit 
reported a series of three drug transactions between Webb 
and Johnson, transactions that verified Johnson's statement 
that Webb had been a supplier of narcotics "for an extended 
period of time."  App. 188.  Courts have been considerably 
more lenient in assessing the currency of information sup-
porting probable cause in the context of extended conspira-
cies than in the context of single-incident crimes.  See gener-
ally United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 568 (1st Cir. 
1996);  United States v. Dozier, 844 F.2d 701, 707 (9th Cir. 
1988);  In re Search Warrant Dated July 4, 1977, 667 F.2d 
117, 135-36 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  While Webb was not ultimately 
charged with conspiracy, the warrant application expressly 
sought evidence regarding the crime of conspiracy to distrib-
ute cocaine base.  See App. 190.  Moreover, even if Webb did 
not have drugs in his apartment at the time of the application, 
it would not necessarily have been unreasonable for an officer 
to conclude that a longtime drug dealer, whose most recent 
known deal had occurred three months earlier, would still

     19  Leon also permits suppression if "the magistrate abandoned 
his detached and neutral role," or if the officers were "dishonest or 
reckless in preparing their affidavit."  468 U.S. at 926.  There is no 
suggestion in the record that either circumstance applies to this 
case.

retain papers permitting him to get back in touch with his 
customers or--as turned out to be the case--his supplier.

     In sum, whatever may be said of the search warrant 
affidavit in this case, we cannot say "that no reasonably well 
trained police officer could have believed that there existed 
probable cause to search" Webb's apartment.  Leon, 468 U.S. 
at 926.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in failing to 
suppress the evidence recovered from the search.

     We conclude that neither Apprendi and its progeny, nor 
the Sentencing Guidelines, compel a conclusion that the sen-
tence imposed upon Webb was reversible error.  Nor do we 
find reversible error in the district court's evidentiary rulings 
or in its denial of Webb's motion to suppress.  Webb's 
convictions and sentence are therefore
