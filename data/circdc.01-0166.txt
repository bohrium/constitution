     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Concurring opinion filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Following enactment of the Tele-
communications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications 
Commission promulgated a rule prohibiting restrictions on 
certain over-the-air reception devices ("OTARD").  The rule 
invalidated

     [a]ny restriction, including but not limited to any state or 
     local law or regulation, including zoning, land-use or build-
     ing regulation, or any private covenant, homeowners' asso-
     ciation rule or similar restriction on property within the 
     exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the user 
     has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the property 
     
     that impairs the installation, maintenance, or use of [anten-
     nas that are designed to receive direct broadcast satellite 
     service, video programming services via multipoint distribu-
     tion services, or television broadcast signals]....
     
Preemption of Local Zoning Regulation of Satellite Earth 
Stations, Implementation of Section 207 of the Telecommuni-
cations Act of 1996:  Restrictions on Over-the-Air Reception 
Devices:  Television Broadcast Service and Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service, 11 F.C.C.R. 19276 (1996) 
("First OTARD Order").  In 1998, the Commission extended 
the prohibition, with certain exceptions, to "lease provision[s] 
... where the [antenna] user has a ... leasehold interest in 
the property."  In the Matter of Implementation of Section 
207 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996--Restrictions on 
Over-the-Air Reception Devices:  Television Broadcast, Mul-
tichannel Multipoint Distribution and Direct Broadcast Sat-
ellite Services, 13 F.C.C.R. 23874 (1998) ("Second OTARD 
Order").

     Several trade associations representing real estate owners 
and property managers1 appeal the Second OTARD Order, 
contending that the rule, as amended, is invalid on its face.  
They contend, first, that the Commission exceeded its statuto-
ry authority in extending the OTARD rule to leased property;  
second, that the amended rule violates the Takings Clause of 
the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution;2  and 
third, if there is no taking, that the Commission acted arbi-
trarily and capriciously in extending the rule to leaseholds.  
Finding unpersuasive these facial challenges to the amended 
OTARD rule, we deny the petition.

                                I.

     In promulgating the OTARD rules, the Commission relied 
on s 207 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 
104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (the "1996 Act"), which provides:

     Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
     the Commission shall, pursuant to Section 303 of the 
     Communications Act of 1934, promulgate regulations to 
     prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer's ability to 
     receive video programming services through devices de-
     signed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast 
     signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or 
     direct broadcast satellite services.
     
The 1996 Act also added a new subsection 303(v) to the 
Communications Act of 1934, granting the Commission

     exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct-
     to-home satellite services ... [T]he term "direct-to-home 
     satellite services" means the distribution or broadcasting 
     of programming or services by satellite directly to the 
     subscriber's premises without the use of ground receiv-
     ing or distribution equipment . . . .
     
47 U.S.C. s 303(v).  The 1996 Act left undisturbed the broad 
statutory directives contained in the Communications Act of 
1934, including the Commission's mandate to "make [commu-
nications services] available ... to all the people of the 
United States," 47 U.S.C. s 151, and the Commission's au-
thority to "perform any and all acts, make such rules and 
regulations, and issue such orders . . . as may be necessary in 
the execution of its functions."  Id. s 154(i).

     As early as the 1980s, the Commission had begun restrict-
ing potential barriers to the development of satellite-based 
residential video programming.  See, e.g., Preemption of Lo-
cal Zoning or Other Regulation of Receive-Only Satellite 
Earth Stations, 51 Fed. Reg. 5519 (1986).  In direct response 
to the directives in the 1996 Act, the Commission promulgat-
ed rules to safeguard viewers' ability to use devices designed 
for direct broadcast satellite services, television broadcast 
services, and multichannel multipoint distribution services 

(collectively, "s 207 devices").  See, e.g., Preemption of Local 
Zoning Regulation of Satellite Earth Stations, 11 F.C.C.R. 
5809 (1996);  Implementation of Section 207 of the Telecom-
munications Act of 1996:  Restrictions on Over-the-Air Re-
ception Devices:  Television Broadcast and Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service, Notice of Proposed Rule-
making, 11 F.C.C.R. 6357 (1996).  The Commission adopted 
its first rule implementing s 207 on August 5, 1996.  See 
First OTARD Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 19276 (1996).  The first 
OTARD rule provided:

     Any restriction, including but not limited to any state or 
     local law or regulation, including zoning, land-use or 
     building regulation, or any private covenant, home-
     owners' association rule or similar restriction on property 
     within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user 
     where the user has a direct or indirect ownership inter-
     est in the property, that impairs the installation, mainte-
     nance, or use of [a s 207 device] ... is prohibited....
     
47 C.F.R. s 1.4000 (1996).  The prohibitions in the first 
OTARD rule applied only to property in which the "user" of 
satellite services (i.e., the "viewer" for purposes of s 207) had 
an ownership interest.  Despite its stated prohibition of "any" 
restriction, the rule allowed for several exceptions:  Restric-
tions on s 207 devices were permissible if they served a 
"clearly defined safety objective" and were administered "in a 
nondiscriminatory manner to other . . . devices . . . that [we]re 
comparable in size, weight and appearance," or if they were 
"necessary to preserve an historic district," and if the restric-
tions were no more burdensome than necessary.  Id. 
s 1.4000(b)(1)-(3).3  In addition, the OTARD rule permitted 
waiver by the Commission upon the request of local govern-
ments or associations.  See id. s 1.4000(c).

     The first OTARD rule left unresolved whether the s 207 
prohibition should apply to "property not within the exclusive 

__________
     3  In the Second OTARD Order, the Commission amended 
s 1.4000(b)(2) to except "a prehistoric or historic district, site, 
building, structure or object included in, or eligible for inclusion on, 
the National Register of Historic Places...."

[use or] control of a person with an ownership interest," such 
as common areas or rental properties.  First OTARD Order, 
11 F.C.C.R. at 19311;  see also id. at 19314.  On November 
20, 1998, after notice and comment, the Commission expanded 
the OTARD prohibition to include restrictions on s 207 re-
ception devices on rental property that is within the exclusive 
use or control of the tenant who has a leasehold interest in 
the property.  See Second OTARD Order, 13 F.C.C.R. 23874 
(1998).  The amended OTARD rule provides in relevant part:

     (a)(1) Any restriction, including but not limited to any 
     state or local law or regulation, including zoning, land-
     use, or building regulations, or any private covenant, 
     contract provision, lease provision, homeowners' associa-
     tion rule or similar restriction, on property within the 
     exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the 
     user has a direct or indirect ownership interest or lease-
     hold interest in the property that impairs the installation, 
     maintenance, or use of [a s 207 device] ... is prohibit-
     ed....
     
47 C.F.R. s 1.4000(a)(1) (1998) (new language italicized).  Un-
der the amended OTARD rule, tenants are able, subject to 
some restrictions, to install s 207 devices "wherever they rent 
space outside of a building, such as balcony railings, patios, 
yards, gardens, or any other similar area" and, in some 
instances, inside rental units.  Second OTARD Order, 13 
F.C.C.R. at 23875.4  The Commission did not, however, ex-
tend the OTARD rule to the placement of antennas on 
common property such as outside walls (where viewers may 
have access but not possession and exclusive rights of use or 
control) or restricted access areas such as rooftops (where 

__________
     4  For tenants who do not lease outside rental space, the Com-
mission noted that "our new rules permit the installation of Section 
207 devices inside rental units and anticipate the development of 
future technology that will create devices capable of receiving video 
programming signals inside buildings."  Second OTARD Order , 13 
F.C.C.R. at 23875-76.  The Commission noted that one such device 
already permits inside receipt of signals.  Id. at 23876.

viewers generally do not have access or possession).  See id. 
at 23893 p 35.

     Following the Commission's denial of petitions for reconsid-
eration of the Second OTARD Order, petitioners filed this 
appeal.

                               II.

     Petitioners contend that the Commission exceeded its stat-
utory authority by extending the OTARD prohibition to 
leased property.  To determine whether the Commission 
acted within its legally delegated authority in promulgating 
the amended OTARD rule, the court employs the familiar 
test outlined by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. 
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984):  
If, through the Communications Act, Congress has spoken 
directly to the precise issue presented by petitioners, "that is 
the end of the matter," and the court defers to the "unambig-
uously expressed intent of Congress."  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 
842-43.  If, however, the Communications Act "is silent or 
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue" at hand, the 
Commission may exercise its reasonable discretion in constru-
ing the statute.5  Id.  As petitioners contend--and as the 
Commission implicitly concedes, see Second OTARD Order, 
13 F.C.C.R. at 23880--the Communications Act does not 
explicitly address the landlord-tenant relationship, nor does it 
explicitly grant the Commission jurisdiction over the real 
estate industry, an area that is normally outside the Commis-
sion's scope of authority.  See, e.g., Illinois Citizens Comm. 
for Broad. v. FCC, 467 F.2d 1397, 1400 (7th Cir. 1972).  
Hence, the court's focus is on whether, in implementing 
s 207, the Commission reasonably interpreted its statutory 
authority.  We look to the text of the Communications Act of 

__________
     5  The court properly applies Chevron analysis to the amended 
OTARD rule because "Congress delegated authority to [the Com-
mission] generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and [the 
OTARD rule] was promulgated in the exercise of that authority."  
United States v. Mead Corp., 121 S. Ct. 2164, 2171 (2001);  see also 
infra Part II.

1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and to the 
legislative history of s 207.

     In enacting the Communications Act of 1934, Congress 
intended "to confer upon the Commission sweeping authority 
to regulate 'in a field of enterprise the dominant characteris-
tic of which was the rapid pace of its unfolding.' "  Office of 
Communication of the United Church of Christ v. F.C.C., 707 
F.2d 1413, 1423 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (quoting National Broad. Co. 
v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 219 (1943)).  In accordance 
with this goal, the provisions of the Communications Act are 
"explicitly applicable to 'all interstate and foreign communica-
tion by wire or radio,' " and the Commission, being the 
"single Government agency with 'unified jurisdiction and reg-
ulatory power over all forms of ... communication,' " is 
granted "broad authority" to execute its mandate.  United 
States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 167-68 (1968) 
(quoting 47 U.S.C. s 152(a)) (footnotes omitted);  see also 
Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 700 (1984);  
Metropolitan Council of NAACP Branches v. FCC, 46 F.3d 
1154, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  United Video, Inc. v. FCC, 890 
F.2d 1173, 1182-83 (D.C. Cir. 1989);  National Ass'n of Regu-
latory Utility Comm'rs v. FCC, 746 F.2d 1492, 1499, 1501 
(D.C. Cir. 1984);  Wold Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 735 
F.2d 1465, 1474-76 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  The Communications 
Act thus directs the Commission to "perform any and all acts, 
make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders . . . as 
may be necessary in the execution of its functions."  47 
U.S.C. s 154(i);  see also id. s 303(r).

     Congress continued in the 1996 Act to vest broad authority 
in the Commission, granting the Commission "exclusive juris-
diction to regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite 
services," 47 U.S.C. s 303(r), and instructing the Commission 
promptly to issue regulations to "prohibit restrictions" that 
impede "viewer[s]" from using s 207 devices.6  Id. s 207.  
Consistent with the broad language of other sections of the 

__________
     6  The parties' discussion of s 207 is not advanced by emphasis 
on whether s 207 is properly labeled as a directive for the Commis-
sion to act pursuant to pre-existing authority, rather than as a 
source of independent authority.  Whether s 207 is viewed as new 
authority or as a directive to act upon existing authority, s 207 

Commission's enabling statute, Congress demonstrated no 
intent to qualify the terms "viewer" and "restrictions":  It did 
not specify which types of "viewer[s]" were covered, or which 
types of "restrictions" were permissible.  Had Congress in-
tended to qualify these terms, it clearly would have done so, 
especially in light of the courts' expansive reading of Con-
gress's previous delegations of authority to the Commission.  
See generally Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus., 508 
U.S. 152, 159 (1993);  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 
U.S. 677, 696-99 (1979);  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580-
81 (1978);  Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Department of Transp., 
137 F.3d 640, 645-46 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Having "explicitly left 
a gap for [the Commission] to fill," Congress delegated to the 
Commission the authority to "elucidate [s 207] by regulation" 
and to "address[ ] ambiguity in the statute," United States v. 
Mead Corp., 121 S. Ct. 2164, 2171 (2001) (quoting Chevron, 
467 U.S. at 843-44), and thus to preempt State enforcement 
of lease provisions that place "restrictions on viewers who 
wish to install, maintain, or use a [s ] 207 reception device 
within their leasehold."7  Second OTARD Order, 13 F.C.C.R. 
at 23877.

     The legislative history of s 207 reinforces the conclusion 
that Congress intended in s 207 to give the Commission a 

__________
suffices as a statutory basis for the Second OTARD Order.  More-
over, petitioners' belittling of the significance of s 207 on the 
ground that, unlike other sections of the 1996 Act, s 207 is uncodi-
fied is misplaced;  that the section was not codified in the United 
States Code does not detract from s 207's legal authority.  See 
United States Bank of Oregon v. Independent Ins. Agents of 
America, Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 448 (1993).

     7  The Commission's statutory authority is, of course, subject to 
limitations:  It is "restricted to that reasonably ancillary to the 
effective performance of [its] various responsibilities."  Southwest-
ern Cable Co., 392 U.S. at 178.  In light of Congress's explicit (and 
exclusive) grant of jurisdiction to the Commission over direct-to-
home satellite services and its broad responsibility to make commu-
nications services available to all individuals, an OTARD rule that 
safeguards all viewers' access to these services clearly falls within 
this limitation.

very broad mandate.  The House Committee Report on s 207 
states that:

     The Committee intends this section to preempt enforce-
     ment of State or local statutes and regulations, or State 
     or local legal requirements, or restrictive covenants or 
     encumbrances that prevent the use of antennae designed 
     for off-the-air reception of television broadcast signals or 
     of satellite receivers designed for receipt of [direct 
     broadcast satellite] services.  Existing regulations, in-
     cluding but not limited to, zoning laws, ordinances, re-
     strictive covenants or homeowners' association rules, 
     shall be unenforceable to the extent contrary to this 
     section.
     
H.R. Rep. No. 104-204 at 123-24 (1995).  Petitioners read 
this statement to reflect Congress's intent to prohibit only 
restrictions affecting property owners, such as zoning restric-
tions, covenants, and homeowners' association restrictions, 
thereby restoring those individuals' property rights.  An 
equally plausible reading of the House Report--and one 
consistent with the broad authority reflected in the Commis-
sion's statutory mandate--would indicate Congress's intent to 
invalidate various types of private contracts under State law, 
such as homeowners' association contracts and lease agree-
ments, that might interfere with a viewer's ability to receive 
certain types of satellite broadcasting signals.

     Petitioners' essential claim is that however broad the Com-
mission's mandate, it may only exercise its authority over 
"communications and persons . . . engaged in communica-
tions."  47 U.S.C. s 152(a).  This, petitioners contend, does 
not include either the real estate industry or the landlord-
tenant relationship, which is a legal allocation of property 
rights governed by State law.  Petitioners rely on cases in 
which courts have denied the Commission the authority "to 
determine the validity of contracts between [Commission] 
licensees and others," Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Georgia v. 
Carroll, 338 U.S. 586, 602 (1950), or to regulate any and all 
activities that "substantially affect communications."  Illinois 
Citizens Comm. for Broad., 467 F.2d at 1400;  see also Radio 

Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U.S. 120, 131-32 (1945);  
Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 19 F.3d 1475, 1484 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994).  In contrast to those cases, however, the issue 
here is not the extent to which a ruling by the Commission 
affects areas that are tangential to the Commission's jurisdic-
tion, such as the height and location of a building.  See, e.g., 
Illinois Citizens Comm. for Broad., 467 F.2d at 1400.  Con-
gress has expressly vested the Commission with exclusive 
jurisdiction and authority to ensure that all viewers may 
access direct-to-home satellite services.  See 47 U.S.C. 
s 303(v);  1996 Act, Pub. L. No. 104-104, s 207, 110 Stat. 56. 
Where the Commission has been instructed by Congress to 
prohibit restrictions on the provision of a regulated means of 
communication, it may assert jurisdiction over a party that 
directly furnishes those restrictions, and, in so doing, the 
Commission may alter property rights created under State 
law.  See Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 
355, 368-69 (1986);  Fidelity Fed. Savings and Loan Ass'n v. 
De la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153-54 (1982);  Capital Cities 
Cable, 467 U.S. at 698-700;  New York State Comm'n on 
Cable Television v. FCC, 749 F.2d 804, 807-08 (D.C. Cir. 
1984).8

     For these reasons, we hold that the Commission could 
reasonably construe s 207 to apply to all "viewer[s]," includ-
ing tenants, and to obligate the Commission to prohibit "[a]ny 
restriction," including lease provisions, "that impairs the in-
stallation, maintenance, or use of [a s 207 device]."  47 
C.F.R. s 1.4000.  It follows that the court properly defers to 
the Commission's interpretation of its statutory authority.  
See Mead Corp., 121 S. Ct. at 2171-73;  Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n 
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 470 U.S. 116, 125 
(1985);  see also United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, 
Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 131 (1985).

                               III.

     Possibly foreseeing their fate under Chevron, petitioners 
contend that our analysis of the amended OTARD rule 

__________
     8  Petitioners do not rely on s 152(b) as a jurisdictional limita-
tion on the Commission's authority to promulgate the amended 
OTARD rule.  See Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n., 476 U.S. at 369.

should be guided not by Chevron, but rather by the princi-
ples set forth in Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies v. FCC, 
24 F.3d 1441 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  In Bell Atlantic, the court 
declined to apply Chevron deference to a Commission order 
requiring the physical collocation of competitive access pro-
viders to the central offices of local telephone exchange 
companies.  Faced with a similar statutory silence on the 
precise issue at hand, see id. at 1445, the court adopted a 
"narrowing construction" of the Communications Act9 be-
cause the Commission's interpretation created an "identifi-
able class" of applications that would "necessarily constitute a 
taking."  Id. at 1445-46 (quoting Riverside Bayview Homes, 
474 U.S. at 128 n.5).  Petitioners contend that, as in Bell 
Atlantic, the Commission's interpretation of s 207 and of its 
authority under the Communications Act creates such an 
"identifiable class" and is therefore impermissible.  Consis-
tent with Supreme Court instruction, we disagree.

     The first obstacle to petitioners' takings claim arises from 
their effort to classify the amended OTARD prohibition as a 
per se taking under Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan 
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).  In Loretto, the Supreme 
Court held that a "physical intrusion by government [is] a 
property restriction of an unusually serious character for 
purposes of the Takings Clause."  Id. at 426 (internal quota-
tions omitted).  The Court further held that "when the physi-
cal intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physi-
cal occupation, a [per se] taking has occurred."  Id.  Thus, in 
Loretto, the Supreme Court invalidated a New York statute 
authorizing a cable television company to place cable equip-
ment onto a private property owner's building on the grounds 
that the statute constituted a per se taking.  Id. at 438-39.  
Petitioners contend that a tenant's unauthorized use of the 
property, by installing a s 207 device against the express 
wishes of the landlord, is an invasion of the property rights 
that the landlord has chosen to retain in the leased property

     9  At issue in Bell Atlantic was the authority of the Commission, 
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. s 201(a), to order carriers "to establish 
physical connections with other carriers."

and therefore amounts to a per se taking.  Petitioners further 
contend that the amended OTARD rule constitutes a per se 
taking under Loretto because it enlarges the tenant's rights 
beyond the contractual provisions of the lease, thereby strip-
ping landowners of property rights that they rightfully re-
served, and constitutes a taking of the property owner's right 
to exclude.  None of these contentions suffices to characterize 
the amended OTARD rule as a per se taking.

     First, petitioners fail to acknowledge a key factor that 
places the amended OTARD rule outside the scope of Loretto:  
consent to the occupation of the property.  The Loretto court 
emphasized that the per se taking rule is "very narrow" and 
applies only to regulations that "require the landlord to suffer 
the physical intrusion of his building by a third party."  Id. at 
440-41 (emphasis added).  Unlike the building owner in Lor-
etto, whose premises were occupied without her consent, the 
landlord subject to the amended OTARD rule has ceded 
control of his or her property to a tenant with whom the 
landlord has a contractual relationship.  Thus, no "third 
party" stranger to the property is involved.  While petition-
ers would label a tenant a "third party" intruder if the tenant 
uses the premises in a way that is prohibited by the lease, the 
Supreme Court has rejected this characterization.  Consensu-
al occupation of the property, as distinct from a "permanent 
physical occupation," Loretto, 458 U.S. at 426, occurs once the 
landlord voluntarily enters into a lease with the tenant.  In 
FCC v. Florida Power Corp., 480 U.S. 245 (1981), for exam-
ple, the Supreme Court upheld the Commission's authority 
under the Pole Attachments Act, 47 U.S.C. s 224 (1991), to 
regulate pole rental fees paid to an electric utility by various 
cable television companies using the utility's poles.10  The 

__________
     10  The Court noted that the Pole Attachments Act was "enacted 
by Congress as a solution to a perceived danger of anticompetitive 
practices by utilities in connection with cable television service."  
Florida Power, 480 U.S. at 247.  Prior to that enactment, utility 
companies had leased the space on their poles to cable operators, 
who claimed that "the utility companies were exploiting their mo-
nopoly position by engaging in widespread overcharging...."  Id.  
The Commission states in its brief that petitioners are building 

Court distinguished Loretto on the grounds that, unlike the 
New York statute that allowed cable companies to access an 
individual's property, the Pole Attachments Act did not au-
thorize third parties to access the utility poles, but merely 
regulated the terms of the rental once cable companies and 
the utilities agreed to the rental of the poles.  "Required 
acquiescence," the Court held, "is at the heart of the [Loretto] 
concept of occupation."  Id. at 252.  It is thus "the invitation, 
not the rent, that makes the difference.  The line which 
separates [landlord-tenant] cases from Loretto is the unam-
biguous distinction between a commercial lessee and an 
interloper with a government license." Id. at 252-53 (empha-
sis added).  As with the pole rentals in Florida Power, the 
landlord affected by the amended OTARD rule will have 
voluntarily ceded control of an interest in his or her property 
to a tenant.  Having ceded such possession of the property, a 
landlord thereby submits to the Commission's rightful regula-
tion of a term of that occupation.11  See Florida Power, 480 
U.S. at 252.

     Second, petitioners ignore the extensive case law upholding 
the government's authority to regulate various aspects of the 
landlord-tenant relationship "without paying compensation for 

__________
owners who seek to maintain bottleneck control over access to 
rental buildings by cable and satellite master antenna operators of 
the building owners' choosing.  See Br. for Respondent at 11-12.  
The court has no occasion to evaluate this statement.

     11  Contrary to petitioners' contention, Gulf Power Co. v. United 
States, 187 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 1999), does not imply a different 
result.  In Gulf Power, the Eleventh Circuit held that a 1996 
amendment to the Pole Attachments Act, providing that utilities 
must provide telecommunications carriers access to their utility 
poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way, effected a per se taking of 
the utility's property.  See id. at 1329;  see also 47 U.S.C. 
s 224(f)(1).  The court concluded that the 1996 amendment "re-
quire[d] a utility to acquiesce to a permanent, physical occupation of 
its property" by a third party.  Id. at 1329.  This element of 
"required acquiescence," the court observed, distinguished the case 
from Florida Power and brought the amended statute within the 
scope of Loretto.  Id. at 1329 (quoting Florida Power, 480 U.S. at 
252).

all economic injuries that such regulation entails," Loretto, 
458 U.S. at 440, even though some of these regulations 
"transfer wealth from the one who is regulated to another."  
Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 529 (1992).  Although 
a landlord's lease restrictions are enforceable property rights, 
see United States v. General Motors, 323 U.S. 373, 380-82 
(1945), governmental restrictions on the exercise of those 
rights do not necessarily constitute a per se taking.  For 
example, "[w]hen a landowner decides to rent his land to 
tenants, the government may place ceilings on the rents the 
landowner can charge, or require the landowner to accept 
tenants he does not like, without [creating a per se taking]."  
Yee, 503 U.S. at 529 (citations omitted);  see also PruneYard 
Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980);  Heart of 
Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258 (1964);  
McAndrews v. Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, 989 F.2d 13 (1st 
Cir. 1993).  In light of this precedent, regulation of a single 
aspect of the landlord-tenant relationship, enacted pursuant 
to the manifest congressional objective of safeguarding view-
ers' access to direct-to-home satellite services, does not result 
in a per se taking.  See 47 U.S.C. ss 151, 303(v).

     Third, the Supreme Court has rejected the contention that 
regulation of the terms of a landlord-tenant relationship 
constitutes on its face an invasion of the landlord's right to 
exclude.  See Yee, 503 U.S. at 527-28.  In Yee, the Court held 
that a rent control ordinance affecting the owners of a mobile 
home park, even when considered in light of a State law 
restricting the landlords' right of eviction, did not constitute a 
taking of the landlords' right to exclude.  See id.  The Court 
stated that "no government has required any physical inva-
sion of petitioners' property.  Petitioners' tenants were invit-
ed by petitioners, not forced upon them by the government."  
Id. at 528 (citing Florida Power, 480 U.S. at 252-53).  Conse-
quently, "[w]hile the 'right to exclude' is doubtless ... 'one of 
the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are 
commonly characterized as property,' ... that right [was not] 
taken from petitioners on the mere face of the [regulation]."  
Id. (quoting Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 176 
(1979)).

     Because the amended OTARD rule does not amount to a 
compelled physical invasion of property,12 and hence a per se 
taking, petitioners' only potential takings claim is a regulatory 
taking claim.  That kind of claim requires "ad hoc, factual 
inquiries," Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 
U.S. 104, 124 (1978),13 and "entails complex factual assess-
ments of the purposes and economic effects of government 
action."  Yee, 503 U.S. at 523.  Because of this context-
specific standard, the amended OTARD rule cannot be said to 
create an "identifiable class" of applications that would "nec-
essarily constitute a [regulatory] taking."  Bell Atlantic, 24 
F.3d at 1445-46 (quoting Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 
at 128 n.5).  For that reason, the Bell Atlantic approach to 
statutory interpretation does not apply, and the Chevron 
analysis of Part II does.

     Petitioners' alternate claim that even if statutorily autho-
rized, the amended OTARD rule is nonetheless an unconstitu-
tional regulatory taking that must be set aside fails for two 
independent reasons.  First, "in general, '[e]quitable relief is 
not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property 
for a public use, duly authorized by law, when a suit for 
compensation can be brought against the sovereign subse-
quent to that taking.' "  Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 

__________
     12  In the Second OTARD Order, the Commission recognized 
the limitations of its new mandate:

     In [s] 207, Congress did not direct the Commission to impose 
     affirmative duties on other parties to install [s] 207 devices or 
     to grant access to restricted areas to permit the installation of 
     [s] 207 reception devices, and in particular, Congress did not 
     direct the Commission to require property owners to subject 
     property to a Fifth Amendment taking.
     
Second OTARD Order, 13 F.C.C.R. at 23877.

     13  To determine whether a regulation constitutes a regulatory 
taking, the court generally evaluates three factors:  (1) "the econom-
ic impact of the regulation on the claimant";  (2) "the extent to 
which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed 
expectations";  and (3) the "character of the governmental action."  
Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124.

at 127-28 (quoting Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 
986, 1016 (1984));  see also Bell Atlantic, 24 F.3d at 1445 n.1.  
Second, because petitioners' regulatory taking claim depends 
upon ad hoc, factual inquiries, it cannot satisfy the require-
ments for making the kind of facial challenge petitioners have 
brought here.  See Yee, 503 U.S. at 533-34;  Gulf Power Co. 
v. United States, 187 F.2d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir. 1999).  Peti-
tioners are still free to make claims for just compensation on 
account of regulatory takings with respect to their individual 
buildings, but no such claims have been made here, nor could 
they be.  See Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. at 128, 129 
n.6.

                               IV.

     As an apparent afterthought, petitioners summarily con-
tend that in the absence of a taking, the Commission acted 
arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion, in 
promulgating the amended OTARD rule.  Petitioners primar-
ily quote what they consider a "tautology" from the Second 
OTARD Order:  "Removing a restriction on installing an 
antenna within a leasehold does not impose a duty on the 
landlord to relinquish property because the landlord has 
already voluntarily relinquished possession of the leasehold 
by virtue of the lease."  Second OTARD Order, 13 F.C.C.R. 
at 23881.  This statement, petitioners assert, demonstrates 
that the Commission's rule is "purposeless or illogical":  If the 
Commission "has taken nothing," petitioners ask, "then why 
is the rule necessary?"  Petitioners have misconstrued the 
Commission's position.

     Contrary to petitioners' assertion, the Commission does not 
argue that the landlord "gave [ ] away" a property right to 
the tenant by relinquishing possession of the property.  Rath-
er, the quoted statement represents the Commission's posi-
tion, explained in detail in the subsequent paragraphs of the 
Second OTARD Order, that although a landlord may retain 
property interests in a leasehold, a restriction on the terms 
that the landlord may impose on the tenant is not a physical 
occupation giving rise to a per se taking because the landlord 

has "voluntarily relinquished possession" of the property.  
See Second OTARD Order, 13 F.C.C.R. at 23881-86.

     Accordingly, because petitioners' facial challenge fails to 
present an "identifiable set of instances in which mere appli-
cation of [the amended OTARD rule] will necessarily or even 
probably constitute a taking," Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 
U.S. at 128 n.5, we apply Chevron deference to the Commis-
sion's interpretation of s 207 and of its broad mandate under 
the Communications Act, and we deny the petition.14

__________
     14  In a footnote to their brief, petitioners contend in two brief 
sentences, without supporting citation, that the amended OTARD 
rule is void for vagueness.  The court declines to address an issue 
that was presented in such a cursory fashion.  See Washington 
Legal Clinic for the Homeless v. Barry, 107 F.3d 32, 39 (D.C. Cir. 
1997).

     Randolph, Circuit Judge, concurring:  While I join all of 
the court's opinion, I write separately to express my opinion 
that Bell Atlantic Telephone Cos. v. FCC, 24 F.3d 1441 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994), was wrongly decided and ought to be overruled.

     Our opinion in Railway Labor Executives Ass'n v. United 
States, 987 F.2d 806, 815-16 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (per curiam), 
issued shortly before Bell Atlantic, summarized the govern-
ing principles:  "The Fifth Amendment guarantees that when 
the government takes private property, it will provide just 
compensation.  Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. s 1491(a), 
the United States Court of Federal Claims has original 
jurisdiction over suits seeking compensation from the United 
States under the Constitution.  Except for cases in which the 
amount in controversy is less than $10,000, in which event 
jurisdiction is concurrent with the federal district courts, see 
28 U.S.C. s 1346(a)(2), the Federal Claims Court's jurisdic-
tion in such actions is exclusive.  '[T]akings claims against the 
Federal Government are premature until the property owner 
has availed itself of the process provided by the Tucker Act.'  
Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton 
Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 195 (1985)."

     "... The Taking Clause does not prohibit the government 
from taking private property.  The Clause requires only that 
the government accomplish the taking in a particular way, 
namely, by paying for the property.  See First English 
Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 
U.S. 304, 314-15 (1987);  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 
U.S. 986, 1020 (1984).  There is no constitutional necessity for 
payment to be made in advance, at least so long as the 
government provides a way for the property owner to recover 
just compensation after the taking is completed.  See Ruckel-
shaus, 467 U.S. at 1016.  As we have said, those adversely 
affected by the Commission's action may pursue their claims 
in the Federal Claims Court or, depending on the amount at 
stake, in the federal district courts."

     "There is nothing to petitioners' further point that, at the 
least, we ought to construe [the statute] to avoid the possibili-
ty that the [agency] has effectuated a taking in this case.  
The argument may rest on the familiar canon that if one 
permissible interpretation of statute would render it unconsti-

tutional and another permissible interpretation would make it 
constitutional, the latter should prevail because the judiciary 
should not assume Congress meant to violate the Constitu-
tion.  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 147-49 (1927) (opinion 
of Holmes, J.).  Or the argument may rely on the more 
debatable canon of construing statutes to avoid constitutional 
doubts.  Compare Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 366-67 
(1974), with Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 190-91 (1991). But 
these canons do not fit.  Because just compensation is pre-
sumptively available under the Tucker Act, there is neither 
an unconstitutional result nor a constitutional doubt to be 
averted by interpretation.  See United States v. Riverside 
Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 127-28 (1985)."

     Doubtless in recognition of these principles, Bell Atlantic 
begins with a disclaimer and then adds a qualifier:  this court 
has no "power" to decide whether an agency regulation rule 
"inflicted" a taking of private property within the meaning of 
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution--if the regulation 
was within the agency's statutory authority.  24 F.3d at 1444 
n.1.  How to determine the "if"?  According to Bell Atlantic, 
not in the usual deference-laced manner because "statutes 
will be construed to defeat administrative orders that raise 
substantial constitutional questions," id. at 1445.  That point 
is directly contrary to Railway Labor's recognition that there 
is no constitutional doubt to be avoided.  And it is also 
directly contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in United 
States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 128 
(1985), that "the possibility that the application of a regulato-
ry program may in some instances result in the taking of ... 
property is no justification for the use of narrowing construc-
tions to curtail the program if compensation will in any event 
be available in those cases where a taking has occurred."

     Bell Atlantic's other rationale for adjudicating whether a 
regulation would take property, and for construing the stat-
ute to prevent this, stems from a footnote in Riverside 
Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. at 128 n.5.  The Supreme 
Court there distinguished United States v. Security Industri-
al Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 78 (1982), on the basis that statutory 
interpretation might be affected if "there is an identifiable 

class of cases in which application of a statute will necessarily 
constitute a taking."  The Court described Security Industri-
al Bank as a case in which a narrowing construction was 
appropriate because "a particular provision of the Bankruptcy 
Code would in every case constitute a taking."  Id.  This is 
reflected in the Court's expression of doubt in Security 
Industrial Bank whether so applying a Code provision "com-
ports with the Fifth Amendment."  459 U.S. at 78.  Given the 
Court's analysis in Riverside Bayview--namely, that only an 
uncompensated taking of private property could violate the 
Fifth Amendment--the statement in Security Industrial 
Bank just quoted has to mean that there would have been no 
just compensation for the threatened takings, or that the 
Court thought there would not be.  This reading is supported 
by Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 
555 (1935), the case Security Industrial Bank relied upon and 
reaffirmed.  Radford invalidated a retroactive change in the 
bankruptcy laws permitting debtors to retain their property 
more easily because the "Act as applied ha[d] taken from the 
Bank without compensation."  Id. at 601 (emphasis added).

     In this case there is no doubt that if a taking occurs as a 
result of the Commission's rule, the property owner may 
receive just compensation.  See maj. op. at 17.  To my mind, 
that ought to end the takings inquiry.  I recognize that Bell 
Atlantic treats the matter very differently:  "Chevron defer-
ence to agency action that creates a broad class of takings 
claims, compensable in the Court of Claims, would allow 
agencies to use statutory silence or ambiguity to expose the 
Treasury to liability both massive and unforeseen."  Bell 
Atlantic, 24 F.3d at 1445.  In other words, the fact that 
compensation would be available is a reason for a narrowing 
construction--the opposite of what the Supreme Court held.

     But my disagreement with Bell Atlantic's theory rests on 
more than just its misreading of the Supreme Court's opinion 
in Riverside Bayview.  It is not clear to me how, in many 
instances, we could determine whether an agency rule would 
bring about a taking in a "broad" class of cases (a term not 
used in Riverside Bayview).  Bell Atlantic makes no distinc-
tion between regulatory and per se takings;  whether a regu-

latory taking has occurred may depend on the "background 
principles" of each state's property law.  See Lucas v. South 
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1031 (1992).  In how 
many states, or in how many instances, there must be a 
taking before we find a "broad class of takings" under Bell 
Atlantic is a mystery.

     I also disagree with the rationale, relied upon in Bell 
Atlantic, that it is the business of the federal courts to 
protect the government from some imagined risk of agency 
encroachment on Congress's taxation and appropriations pow-
ers.  By passing the Tucker Act, Congress generally bound 
itself to paying for authorized takings by the federal govern-
ment, regardless whether the specific liability in any particu-
lar case was intended or foreseen.  See Regional Rail Reor-
ganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 126-27 (1974).  While it 
may be the case that the courts must protect one branch from 
the aggrandizing actions of another, see generally Mistretta v. 
United States, 488 U.S. 361, 380-84 (1989) (collecting cases), 
surely it is not the case that the courts must protect Congress 
from creating responsibilities for itself (so long as they do not 
detract from the other branches' powers or violate the delega-
tion doctrine).  Since the political branches have made a 
legislative choice to accept federal liability for takings, the 
federal courts must respect that determination.  Besides, if 
Congress disagrees with an agency's subjecting the Treasury 
to liability through taking claims, it can always reverse the 
agency's rule through legislation, either before the rule takes 
effect, see Congressional Review Act, Pub. L. No. 104-121, tit. 
II, s 251, 110 Stat. 868 (1996) (codified at 5 U.S.C. ss 801-
808), or afterwards.

     Given the opportunity, I would vote to overturn Bell Atlan-
tic.
