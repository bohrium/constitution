     Before:  Williams, Randolph, and Garland, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  In the District of Columbia, 
taxicabs must be inspected every six months.  A sticker 
affixed to the windshield signifies that the vehicle has passed 
inspection.  The three defendants in this appeal had worked 
as motor vehicle inspectors at one of the District's inspection 
stations.  While so employed they engaged in a conspiracy to 
sell inspection stickers to taxicab drivers and others.  A jury 
found one of the defendants guilty of receiving a bribe in 
violation of federal law, and another guilty of conspiring to 
receive a bribe.  The third defendant entered a guilty plea to 
receiving a bribe, while reserving the right to challenge the 
district court's jurisdiction on appeal.  The so-called jurisdic-
tional question raised by all three defendants is the first 
question we will take up.

                                I

     The statute cited in the indictments sanctions any "public 
official" who--

     directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, 
     accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value 
     personally or for any other person or entity, in return for 
     (A) being influenced in the performance of any official 
     act;  ...  or (C) being induced to do or omit to do any 
     act in violation of the official duty of such official or 
     person.
     
18 U.S.C. s 201(b)(2)(A), (C).  Enacted in 1962, the statute 
applied to District officials through the following language:  
"the term 'public official' means ... an officer or employee or 
person acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any 
department, agency or branch of Government thereof, includ-
ing the District of Columbia...."  18 U.S.C. s 201(a)(1).

     The defendants maintain that Congress's acquiescence in a 
bribery statute, enacted by the D.C. Council in 1982, effec-
tively repealed s 201's applicability to District officials.  The 
local bribery statute, introduced as part of the District of 
Columbia Theft and White Collar Crimes Act, D.C. Law 
4-164, uses language similar to s 201(b) and applies only to 
public servants of the District of Columbia.  See D.C. Code 
ss 22-711(6), 22-712.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia 
Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, Pub. 
L. No. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774 (1973) (the "Home Rule Act"), the 
mayor signed the bill including the new bribery provision, and 
the Council forwarded the statute for review by Congress.  
See D.C. Code s 1-233(c)(1) (procedures for review by Con-
gress).  The bill became law when Congress allowed the 
requisite time period to elapse without taking action.

     Though retaining ultimate legislative authority over the 
District, Congress delegated certain specific legislative pow-
ers to the D.C. Council in the Home Rule Act.  Among the 
explicit limitations on the Council is that the Council may not 
"enact any act, or enact any act to amend or repeal any Act of 
Congress, ... which is not restricted in its application exclu-
sively in or to the District." D.C.  Code s 1-233(a)(3).  The 
district court held that this limitation barred the Council from 
putting before Congress a provision that would repeal the 
local portion of a nationally-applicable statute such as s 201.  
We too agree that s 201 continues to apply to District 
officials, but for a different reason.

     Unless there is "clear and manifest" evidence that the 1982 
local bribery provision repealed the relevant portion of s 201, 
the federal bribery statute stands as enacted.  Posadas v. 
National City Bank of N.Y., 296 U.S. 497, 504 (1936);  see 
Navegar, Inc. v. United States, 192 F.3d 1050, 1063 n.8 (D.C. 

Cir. 1999);  United States v. Hansen, 772 F.2d 940, 944 (D.C. 
Cir. 1985).  The fact that the D.C. law covers " 'some or even 
all of the cases provided for by [the prior act]' " is not a basis 
for finding a repeal.  Posadas, 296 U.S. at 504 (quoting Wood 
v. United States, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 342, 362-63 (1842)). It is 
not uncommon for laws to be cumulative.  Local criminal laws 
may cover the same offenses as federal criminal laws.  "In 
the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to 
repeal, the only permissible justification for a repeal by 
implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irrecon-
cilable."  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550 (1974).

     The local bribery statute and the federal statute are not 
irreconcilable.  They are instead quite consistent.  They both 
prohibit the same conduct by District employees;  the only 
significant difference between them is that the maximum 
penalty for the federal offense is up to 15 years of imprison-
ment while the District offense carries a maximum of 10 
years' imprisonment.  The defendants therefore do not spend 
much time trying to convince us that the two statutes cannot 
stand together.  They rely instead on a 1981 Senate commit-
tee report on a criminal code reform bill that was never 
enacted.  See S. Rep. No. 97-307, at 432 (1982).  Among 
other things, the bill would have replaced 18 U.S.C. s 201(b) 
with a new provision that excluded District of Columbia 
public servants.  The bill responded to the D.C. Council's 
concurrent efforts to revise the D.C. criminal code, including 
the enactment of the bribery provision now found in section 
22-712.  The defendants tell us that one of the D.C. Council's 
objectives in enacting its own bribery provision was "to 
consolidate and clarify" the District of Columbia criminal 
laws.  Brief for Appellants at 26, quoting Report by D.C. 
Council's Committee on the Judiciary, June 1, 1982, Bill No. 
4-133.  This, the defendants say, amounts to "clear and 
manifest" evidence of an implied repeal.

     We are unpersuaded.  As far as the D.C. Council is con-
cerned, we cannot find any intent to repeal:  at the same time 
it sent the local bribery provision up to Congress, the Council 
sent up legislation expressly repealing fifty-eight other stat-
utes--three of which appeared in the same chapter as the 

new bribery provisions.  See Theft and White Collar Crimes 
Act of 1982, D.C. Law No. 4-164, s 602(a)-(fff), Act No. 
4-238.  As far as Congress is concerned, a report by one 
Congressional committee on a bill that was never enacted 
counts for very little.  If the question of repealing s 201 as it 
applied to District officials ever explicitly came before Con-
gress there is no compelling reason why Congress would have 
chosen repeal.  When Congress enacted another bribery pro-
vision in 1984, it explicitly covered District officials.  See 18 
U.S.C. s 666(d).  Retaining s 201 as enacted might seem 
desirable to Congress, if only because this gives the United 
States Attorney the option of filing in either the local courts 
or the federal courts.  That is an option the United States 
Attorney enjoys with respect to many offenses, particularly 
those dealing with drugs.  See United States v. Mills, 964 
F.2d 1186, 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc).  Federal court has 
sometimes been the venue of choice because federal sentences 
are higher.  See id.  Furthermore, the District's bribery 
provision became law not because Congress acted, but be-
cause Congress failed to act.  Whether any member of the 
Senate or House paid attention to the question of repealing 
s 201 is impossible to know.  Still less is there clear and 
manifest evidence that a majority of the members of both 
houses considered their inaction a vote for repeal.1

     Because the statutes are not irreconcilable and there is no 
convincing evidence that the later act was intended as a 
substitute, we hold that a repeal by implication did not occur.  
See Posadas, 296 U.S. at 503.

                                II

     The jury found one of the defendants--Daryl Johnson--
guilty of selling a motor vehicle inspection sticker, in violation 

__________
     1 Congress has amended s 201 twice since 1982, when the Dis-
trict's bribery statute took effect, but it never took the opportunity 
to exclude District officials from the statute's coverage.  See Pub. 
L. No. 99-646, s 46(a)-(1), 100 Stat. 3592, 3601-04 (1986);  Pub. L. 
No. 103-322, tit. XXXIII, ss 330011(b), 330016(2)(D), 108 Stat. 
1796, 2144, 2148 (1994).

of 18 U.S.C. s 201(b)(2).  Johnson filed motions for a judg-
ment of acquittal and a new trial, contending that there was 
insufficient evidence to convict him on the bribery charge 
either as a principal or as an aider and abettor, a contention 
he renews on appeal.  The district court denied the motions.

     Viewing the evidence most favorably to the government, as 
we must, see United States v. Clark, 184 F.3d 858, 863 (D.C. 
Cir. 1999), leads to the conclusion that on November 6, 1997, 
while working as a vehicle inspector for the District, Johnson 
sold inspection sticker T217137 to Mohammed Dashtizadeh 
for approximately $70.00.  Prem Randhawa, a taxicab driver, 
asked Kamal, a body shop repairman, to fix the grille on his 
cab so that it would pass inspection.  Kamal told Randhawa 
that the grille could not be fixed but that he could arrange for 
a person known as Mr. Mo to pass inspection in Randhawa's 
cab.  Randhawa went to see Mr. Mo and paid him $150.00 to 
take the car to be inspected.  Mr. Mo later returned the cab 
to Randhawa with a sticker on it.  The parties stipulated that 
government agents removed sticker T217137 from Randha-
wa's taxicab.

     The middleman, Mohammed Dashtizadeh, testified about 
his role in the transaction.  Dashtizadeh said that he knew of 
Randhawa and was able to identify him in court.  When 
asked how they knew each other, Dashtizadeh recounted that 
his friend Kamal had phoned him regarding the grille on 
Randhawa's taxicab.  Kamal sent Randhawa to Dashtizadeh 
to obtain an inspection sticker.  Dashtizadeh testified that he 
sold a sticker to Randhawa for $150.00.  The sticker, Dashti-
zadeh reported, must have come from either Johnson or 
Banks because those were the only two inspectors from whom 
he purchased stickers.  (Dashtizadeh began purchasing in-
spection stickers in late 1997 and purchased a total of four or 
five stickers from Johnson.)

     To establish the identity of the inspector who sold the 
sticker to Dashtizadeh, the government introduced the paper-
work used during the inspection process.  Johnson's initials 
on the sign-out log indicate that sticker T217137 was in his 
possession on the day the corresponding inspection card was 

printed for inspection of a taxicab.  Johnson's custody of 
T217137 is further confirmed by the lane report for that day 
which lists him as the stickerman--the person who affixes the 
sticker to the windshield--and by his signature on the sticker 
inventory log.  In addition, the government produced the 
inspection card for sticker T217137 which lists Brooks as the 
entrance booth inspector, co-defendant Depp as the lane 
inspector, and Johnson working the exit booth as the sticker-
man.  While each of these records points to Johnson as 
having custody of sticker T217137, none of them even lists 
Banks.

     Johnson views the evidence as insufficient to support the 
verdict because the government never established directly 
that he sold the sticker to Dashtizadeh.  How, he asks, could 
the jury decide that he, rather than Banks, sold the sticker 
without direct proof?  The answer is through circumstantial 
evidence.  The sort of direct evidence Johnson thinks was 
needed was not needed.  As the Supreme Court has said, 
"direct evidence of a fact is not required.  Circumstantial 
evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, 
satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence."  Michalic v. 
Cleveland Tankers, Inc., 364 U.S. 325, 330 (1960);  see also 
United States v. Fadayini, 28 F.3d 1236, 1239-40 (D.C. Cir. 
1994).  Those who have tried criminal cases are familiar with 
this example of the power of circumstantial evidence:  if you 
go to bed on a winter's night and the ground is clear and you 
wake up the next morning and see snow on the ground, you 
have circumstantial evidence that it snowed last night.  The 
circumstantial evidence here, while not that powerful, leads us 
to conclude that, with respect to Johnson, "any rational trier 
of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime 
beyond a reasonable doubt."  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 
307, 319 (1979).  It is true that Dashtizadeh's testimony left 
open the possibility that Banks was the seller.  But a rational 
juror could see this possibility as remote indeed in light of 
evidence we have discussed and, at all events, it is settled that 
the government's evidence need not "foreclose every conceiv-
able premise inconsistent with guilt."  United States v. Car-
ter, 522 F.2d 666, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1975).

                               III

     Defendants Ellis Williams and Leon Depp challenge the 
district court's calculation of the relevant conduct attributable 
to them for their roles in the bribery scheme.  They complain 
that the court failed to make specific findings concerning 
when they joined the conspiracy and attributed bribe amounts 
to them that were not reasonably foreseeable in furtherance 
of jointly undertaken criminal activity.  The district court 
held, and the government now argues, that Depp and 
Williams are responsible for all bribes taken after they began 
working at the inspection station, in 1991 and 1992 respective-
ly.

     Under the Sentencing Guidelines, bribery of a public offi-
cial carries a base offense level of ten, which is increased 
when the offense involves multiple bribes or amounts more 
than $2,000.  See U.S.S.G. s 2C1.1.  When calculating the 
number and amount of bribes involved, the sentencing court 
may consider all relevant conduct attributable to the defen-
dant.  In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, 
this includes any acts and omissions of others in furtherance 
of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that were reason-
ably foreseeable to the defendant.  See U.S.S.G. s 1B1.3.  
Applying this standard, the district court held that Depp and 
Williams were accountable for the bribes taken by the other 
inspectors because those actions were both in furtherance of 
jointly undertaken activity and reasonably foreseeable to 
them.  Accordingly, the court held Williams responsible for 
payments totaling between $40,000 to $70,000 and Depp for 
payments between $70,000 to $120,000.

     The court based its determination, which we review for 
clear error, see United States v. Pinnick, 47 F.3d 434, 437 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), on the assumption that Depp and Williams 
began participating in the bribery scheme as soon as they 
began working at the inspection station.  Instead of identify-
ing specific facts to establish that their involvement began at 
that time, the court relied on the fact that the "conspiracy ... 
started back in the '80s" and required the cooperation of 
other inspectors to make it work.  With respect to Depp, the 

court found it significant that "there was never any indication 
that he was not involved from the beginning."  From this, the 
court inferred--unreasonably, we think--that both must have 
joined the scheme quite soon after starting work at the 
station.  That inference is without an evidentiary basis.  For 
one thing, the record shows that not all of the inspectors at 
the inspection station were involved in the conspiracy.  It is 
possible that Williams and Depp waited some time before 
opting to join in.  The district court's conclusion was thus 
improper in the absence of particularized findings demon-
strating that Williams and Depp joined the conspiracy soon 
after their employment began.  See United States v. Chil-
dress, 58 F.3d 693, 722 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (requiring that 
sentencing court make individualized findings on whether 
actions were reasonably foreseeable to defendant);  United 
States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1022-26 (1st Cir. 1992) 
(finding that cocaine sales by coconspirators before defendant 
joined conspiracy were not "relevant conduct" for sentencing).

     Nevertheless, as applied to Williams, the district court's 
erroneous determination is harmless.  The court held 
Williams responsible for bribes taken as of 1992.  Williams 
maintains the evidence established his involvement began no 
earlier than 1994.  Even if Williams is correct, and we 
subtract the bribe amounts from 1992 to 1994, Williams is still 
accountable for more than $40,000.  The district court relied 
on figures submitted by the probation officer and the govern-
ment, both of whom put the total amount at more than 
$49,000.  Eliminating bribes taken before 1994 only reduces 
the total amount by about $4,700.  Had the district court 
included only bribes taken after Williams is known to have 
joined the scheme, the total would still have been more than 
$44,000.  Because the district court's error made no differ-
ence to its relevant conduct determination, resentencing of 
Williams is unwarranted.

     As to Depp, the error is not inconsequential.  The district 
court used a conspiracy period from 1991 through the indict-
ment in 1998.  At the sentencing hearing, Depp disputed the 
length of this period, contending the evidence establishes his 
involvement only as of February 1996.  Refusing to shorten 

the conspiracy period, the court held Depp responsible for 
bribes valued at the low end of the $70,000 to $120,000 
range--calculating the total as $70,065 but conceding that the 
government's figure of $86,325 was largely credible.  If we 
recalculate the amount without bribes taken from 1991 
through 1995 the total figure is significantly reduced.  The 
reduction for bribes provided by just one individual (Otoo) to 
Johnson alone, even crediting Depp's objections, amounts to 
at least $24,500.  Given the potential for such a substantial 
reduction, a remand for a new assessment of Depp's relative 
conduct is necessary.  In making that reassessment, the 
district court may rely on either of the two methods the 
government presented for calculating relevant conduct--the 
testimony of the inspectors' customers or the extrapolation 
from a sampling of illegal stickers.  It may not, however, 
decide that Depp's participation in the scheme began at the 
same time as his employment without the support of particu-
larized findings.

     The case is remanded with respect to Leon Depp for 
resentencing.  In all other respects, the judgment of the 
district court is affirmed.

                                                      So ordered.
