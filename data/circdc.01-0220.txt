     Before:  Sentelle, Randolph and Garland, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  The Association of Civilian Tech-
nicians, Tony Kempenich Memorial Chapter 21 ("the Union") 
petitions this Court for review of the Federal Labor Relations 
Authority's ("FLRA" or "Authority") decision in which the 
FLRA determined that a collective bargaining agreement 
provision requiring the Department of Defense ("DOD") to 
permit employees to use "official time" to lobby Congress on 
pending legislation is contrary to law.  In reaching this 
determination, the Authority concluded that the disputed 
provision would require the agency to use appropriated funds 
in a manner prohibited by section 8012 of the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 105-262, 112 Stat. 
2279, 2299 (1998) ("Appropriations Act").  Because we agree 
with the Authority, we deny the petition for review.

                          I. Background

     The Association of Civilian Technicians, a federal employee 
labor organization, filed a negotiability appeal with the FLRA 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. s 7105(a)(2)(E), concerning provisions of 
a collective bargaining agreement that had been disapproved 
by the head of the agency (the Department of Defense) as 
contrary to law under 5 U.S.C. s 7114(c).  The disputed 
provision would grant official time to "Union officials when 
representing Federal Employees by visiting, phoning and 
writing to elected representatives in support [of] or opposition 
to pending or desired legislation which would impact the 
working conditions of employees represented by the labor 
organization."  Association of Civilian Technicians, Tony 
Kempenich Memorial Ch. 21, 56 F.L.R.A. 526 (2000).

     The Union argues that sections 7131 and 7102 of the 
Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act (the col-
lective bargaining laws) mandate inclusion of this provision.  
5 U.S.C. ss 7102, 7131.  Section 7131 governs the grant of 
"official time," which allows employees performing union rep-
resentation functions to be paid as if they were at work, 
without being charged for annual leave.  Under that section, 

union officials may be granted "official time" for a variety of 
reasons, including those "in connection with any other matter 
covered by [the collective bargaining laws]," so long as such 
time is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest."  
Id. at s 7131(d).  Section 7102(1) provides that employees, 
acting in their union representational capacity, have the right 
to present the views of their labor organization to Congress.  
The FLRA has read these sections together to mean that 
union representatives may receive official time for lobbying 
Congress in matters concerning their working conditions.  
See, e.g., National Fed'n of Fed. Employees Local 259, 52 
F.L.R.A. 920, 932-33 (1997).

     In this case, however, the agency contends, and the Author-
ity agrees, that section 8012 of the Appropriations Act prohib-
its this application of the collective bargaining laws, at least 
with respect to DOD employees.  As the Authority held in 
New Hampshire Nat'l Guard, 54 F.L.R.A. 301, 310 (1998), 
aff'd sub nom. Granite State Chapter, Ass'n of Civilian 
Technicians v. FLRA, 173 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 1999), the autho-
rization in s 7131(d) to negotiate for official time, as with 
bargaining on any other matter under the statute, is contin-
gent on the bargaining proposal being consistent with applica-
ble laws, rules, and regulations. See National Fed'n of Fed. 
Employees Local 2015, 41 F.L.R.A. 1158, 1185 (1991) ("Addi-
tionally, official time may be granted for a variety of matters 
and parties may negotiate under section 7131(d) for official 
time, as long as it is otherwise consistent with the Statute and 
other applicable laws and regulations");  American Fed'n of 
Gov't Employees, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, 39 
F.L.R.A. 546, 553 (1991) (same).  Section 8012 of the Appro-
priations Act provides:  "None of the funds made available by 
this Act shall be used in any way, directly or indirectly, to 
influence congressional action on any legislation or appropria-
tion matters pending before the Congress."  Thus, the Au-
thority concluded that the Appropriations Act precluded, as a 
matter of law, the granting of official time for lobbying 
Congress on pending matters, though not non-pending, de-
sired, legislation. See 56 F.L.R.A. at 529.  In reaching this 
decision, the FLRA relied on decisions of the First and Ninth 

Circuits in Granite State Chapter, Association of Civilian 
Technicians v. FLRA, 173 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 1999) ("Granite 
State"), and Association of Civilian Technicians, Silver Bar-
ons Chapter v. FLRA, 200 F.3d 590 (9th Cir. 2000) ("Silver 
Barons"), which addressed virtually identical collective bar-
gaining provisions and identical DOD appropriations act lan-
guage from previous years.  The Authority rejected the 
union's argument that similar collective bargaining agreement 
provisions were held to be consistent with other anti-lobbying 
laws, including 18 U.S.C. s 1913, and section 8001 of the 
Appropriations Act.  The FLRA observed that "[m]ost of the 
Union's arguments presented in this case have been consid-
ered and rejected in prior decisions."  Specifically, the Au-
thority cited its prior decision in New Hampshire Nat'l 
Guard, 54 F.L.R.A. at 310-11, in which the FLRA noted that 
section 8012 and its predecessors did not contain the same 
exceptions to the lobbying ban as do 18 U.S.C. s 1913 and 
Appropriations Act s 8001.  Rather, section 8012 and its 
predecessors contain an absolute ban on using appropriated 
funds for lobbying.

     Further, the FLRA held that section 8012 was more specif-
ic in scope than 5 U.S.C. s 7131(d), and thus rejected the 
argument that the right to official time prevails as more 
specific than the prohibition against using "funds made avail-
able" for lobbying.  It rejected the union's argument that 
official time was indistinguishable from paid leave under 
section 8012, and that the agency's interpretation would nec-
essarily prohibit lobbying while on paid leave, potentially in 
violation of the First Amendment.  Instead, the FLRA con-
cluded, as it had previously held in Association of Civilian 
Technicians, Old Hickory Chapter and U.S. Dep't of Defense, 
North Carolina Nat'l Guard Bureau, 55 F.L.R.A. 811 (1999) 
("North Carolina Guard"), that official time and annual leave 
were distinguishable.  Finally, the FLRA also rejected the 
union's argument that its previous interpretation of the fore-
runner provisions to 8012 was " 'implausible' " given Con-
gress's rejection of legislation that would have banned lobby-
ing on official time for all federal employees.  56 F.L.R.A. at 
529.  Rather, the FLRA observed that Congress had carved 

out special treatment for DOD employees through the DOD 
Appropriations Act.  Id.

     On motion for reconsideration, the FLRA affirmed its 
decision that disapproval of the provision of the collective 
bargaining agreement applying to pending legislation was 
proper. 56 F.L.R.A. 947 (2000).  The Union sought review in 
this Court.

                           II. Analysis

     "In reviewing the FLRA's interpretation of its own en-
abling statute, we are mindful that we owe great deference to 
the expertise of the Authority as it 'exercises its "special 
function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the 
complexities" of federal labor relations.' "  NLRB Union, 
Local 6 v. FLRA, 842 F.2d 483, 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms v. FLRA, 464 U.S. 
89, 97 (1983)).  Were we reviewing the Authority's interpreta-
tion of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Act, 
we would review that interpretation deferentially under the 
standard set forth in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. 
Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  Here, however, we are 
also faced with the FLRA's interpretation of the Department 
of Defense Appropriations Act, a statute not committed to the 
Authority's administration.  In general, this Court does not 
defer to the FLRA's interpretation of a statute not committed 
to the Authority's administration, but reviews such purely 
legal questions de novo.  See Social Sec. Admin. v. FLRA, 
201 F.3d 465, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  We have reviewed the 
Authority's interpretation of the Appropriations Act under 
this de novo standard.

     Congress expressed a clear intent to prohibit the use "in 
any way" of "funds made available by the [DOD Appropria-
tions] Act" to "influence congressional action on any legisla-
tion or appropriation matters pending before the Congress."  
Appropriations Act s 8012 (emphasis added).  Twice before, 
our sister circuits have addressed this very issue, involving 
the same labor union, similar, if not identical bargaining 
provision language, and identical predecessor DOD appropri-

ations acts. Granite State, 173 F.3d at 27-28;  Silver Barons, 
200 F.3d at 592-93.  And unsurprisingly, twice before, our 
sister circuits have affirmed the Authority's determination 
that the disputed provision was contrary to law and therefore 
nonnegotiable.  Perhaps the Union believed the third time 
would be the charm.  It is not.  Nothing has changed--not 
the crux of the provision in dispute, and not the appropria-
tions act language, and therefore we see no reason to depart 
from our sister circuits' good company.  The Appropriations 
Act prohibits the disputed provision because, as the FLRA 
has had several occasions to reiterate, official time may only 
be granted to the extent that it is consistent with all "applica-
ble laws and regulations."  E.g., NFFE Local 2015, 41 
F.L.R.A. at 1185.  Here the granting of official time is not 
consistent with the Appropriations Act.  Hardly more needs 
to be said.

     The Union also raises a constitutional argument which we 
dispense with just as summarily.  The Union contends that 
the FLRA's treatment of the Appropriations Act raises "seri-
ous" First Amendment concerns because it leads to the 
"unacceptable conclusion that employee activities on paid 
annual leave constitute use of appropriated funds, and that 
s 8012 therefore prohibits employees from visiting Members 
of Congress while on annual leave."  However, this "unaccep-
table conclusion" is predicated on there being no difference 
between annual leave and official time.  That is simply not so.  
The Authority has reasonably distinguished between official 
time and paid annual leave.  See North Carolina Guard, 55 
F.L.R.A. at 813 (setting out the "critical distinction" between 
employee use of official time and annual leave).  The collec-
tive bargaining laws impose restrictions on the use of official 
time that are not applicable to the use of paid annual leave.  
Official time is a "distinct third category of time," id., and 
unlike annual leave, is considered to be "hours of work."  5 
C.F.R. s 551.424(b) (2001).  Annual leave is compensation for 
work performed at other times.  This First Amendment 
argument is a red herring.  Section 8012, like its predeces-
sors, "does not in any way affect what Union members can do 
during their annual leave." Granite State, 173 F.3d at 28 n.3.

     Finally, at oral argument, the question arose whether this 
interpretation of the Appropriations Act would affect lobbying 
by DOD officials (i.e., the Secretary of Defense or other 
agency "management") in their official capacity on behalf of 
the Department and the Executive Branch.  Because this 
issue is not before us, rather only a union's use of "official 
time," we need not address it, though we do note that 
applying section 8012 to DOD officials in their official capacity 
would raise constitutional separation of powers concerns not 
implicated here.  That question would also require us to 
inquire into longstanding practices of DOD officials in lobby-
ing Congress, to determine whether their actions have placed 
a "gloss" on Congress's action in enacting section 8012.  See, 
e.g., FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 
120, 132-33, 137 (2000);  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 
441 U.S. 677, 696-99 (1979).  The agency's continued lobbying 
of Congress in the presence of recurring appropriations act 
provisions such as section 8012 provides additional back-
ground for interpreting such sections not relevant to the case 
before us.

                         III. Conclusion

     Because we agree with the Authority that section 8012 of 
the Appropriations Act renders the disputed provision con-
trary to law, we deny the petition for review.
