               FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                       Decided May 19, 2000

                           No. 99-1342

                            Petitioner

                                v.

           United States Department of Energy, et al., 
                           Respondents

           On Petition for Review of an Action of the 
         Department of Energy and for a Writ of Mandamus

     Martin P. Willard was on the briefs for petitioner.

     Jerry Stouck and Robert L. Shapiro were on the brief for 
amicus curiae.

     Lois J. Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice, John T. Stahr, and John A. Bryson, attor-
neys, and Marc Johnston, attorney, Department of Energy, 
were on the brief for respondents.

     Before:  Williams, Ginsburg, and Sentelle, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed PER CURIAM.

     PER CURIAM:  Wisconsin Electric petitions for review 
and for a writ of mandamus, seeking:  (1) a declaration that 
the Department of Energy must provide both monetary and 
non-monetary relief for having failed to begin disposing of 
Wisconsin Electric's spent nuclear fuel (SNF) on January 31, 
1998, as required by the parties' Contract;  and (2) an order 
directing the DOE to comply with this court's mandates in 
Northern States Power Co. v. DOE, 128 F.3d 754 (D.C. Cir. 
1997) (Northern I), and Northern States Power Co. v. DOE, 
Nos. 97-1064 et al., 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12919 (D.C. Cir. 
May 5, 1998) (Northern II).  The DOE filed a motion to 
dismiss on the ground that the court lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction.

     Wisconsin Electric claims this court has jurisdiction to 
entertain its petition pursuant either to our continuing juris-
diction to enforce our mandates in Northern I and II, see 
Northern I, 128 F.3d at 761 ("We retain jurisdiction over this 
case pending compliance with the mandate issued herewith");  
Northern II, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12919, at *3-4 ("[P]ossi-
bly the award of some forms of equitable adjustment would 
place the DOE in violation of the NWPA and again properly 
trigger our jurisdiction"), or to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
of 1982, s 42 U.S.C. 10139(a)(1).

                          I. Background

     In Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. DOE, 88 F.3d 1272 
(1996), we held that, under the NWPA, the DOE had an 
unconditional obligation--an obligation, that is, without re-
gard to whether a repository was available--to begin dispos-
ing of SNF on January 31, 1998.  See 88 F.3d at 1273, 1275-
76.  The DOE acted to frustrate that decision by holding that 
its failure to perform was "unavoidable" and therefore, under 
the terms of the Contract, did not render the Department 
liable for damages of any kind.  See Northern I, 128 F.3d at 
759-60.  At the instance of several state public utility com-
missions and of certain utilities, including Wisconsin Electric, 

we issued a writ of mandamus forbidding the DOE from 
claiming, in proceedings under its contracts, that its failure to 
perform was "unavoidable" because a repository was not 
available.  See id. at 760-61.  We declined to grant further 
relief to the utilities, however, because they have potentially 
adequate remedies under their contracts with the Depart-
ment.  See id. at 759.  Accordingly, they were remitted to 
their contractual remedies.  See id.

     In a post-judgment order, we expressly reiterated the 
limited reach of our decision:  "[Northern I] describes the 
nature of the DOE's obligation, which was created by the 
NWPA and undertaken by the DOE under the Standard 
Contract.  It does not place the question of contract remedies 
in this court, nor set up this court as a source of remedies 
outside the Standard Contract."  Northern II, 1998 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 12919, at *4.

                           II. Analysis

     In its present petition Wisconsin Electric claims that the 
position the DOE has taken during the negotiations over the 
utility's proposed amendments to the Contract, namely that 
the Department "only will consider monetary relief as a 
remedy for [its] delay," violates the mandates in Northern I 
and II.  That is not correct.  Those mandates prohibit the 
DOE from interpreting the NWPA and its contracts with 
utilities in a manner that would relieve the Department of its 
unconditional obligation to begin disposing of SNF on Janu-
ary 31, 1998;  we expressed no opinion about the relief the 
DOE would have to provide for breach of that obligation.  Cf. 
Northern II, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12919, at *5 ("While the 
[NWPA] requires the DOE to include an unconditional obli-
gation in the Standard Contract, it does not itself require 
performance").  Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction of 
Wisconsin Electric's petition incident to the enforcement of 
our mandates.

     Nor do we have jurisdiction to consider Wisconsin Elec-
tric's petition pursuant to the NWPA, 42 U.S.C. s 10139(a)(1).  
Insofar as it is relevant to the case at bar, that provision 

grants the court jurisdiction over cases seeking review of:  (1) 
final action taken by the agency pursuant to the NWPA, and 
(2) the agency's failure to take any action required by the 
NWPA.  Wisconsin Electric contends that under the terms of 
its Contract the DOE has an obligation to provide it with non-
monetary relief.  Although Wisconsin Electric may be correct 
about that, a contract "[b]reach by the DOE does not violate 
a statutory duty."  Northern II, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12919 
at *5.  The Court of Federal Claims, not this court, is the 
proper forum for adjudicating contract disputes.  See id. at 
*4;  Transohio Sav. Bank v. OTS, 967 F.2d 598, 610 (D.C. Cir. 
1992).  Indeed, Wisconsin Electric's petition raises issues that 
are currently being litigated before the Court of Federal 
Claims and the Federal Circuit.  See Yankee Atomic Electric 
Co. v. United States, 42 Fed. Cl. 223 (1998), appeal docketed, 
No. 99-5140 (Fed. Cir.).

                         III. Conclusion

     Accordingly, Wisconsin Electric's petition is

                                                  Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
