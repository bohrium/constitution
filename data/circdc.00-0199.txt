     Before:  Ginsburg, Tatel, and Garland, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Sharon Graham and Stephen Voss 
petition for review of an order of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) sanctioning them for conduct relating to 
trades executed for their customer, John Broumas.  The 
Commission found that Graham, a registered representative 
with Voss' brokerage firm, violated section 10(b) of the Secu-
rities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated 
thereunder by aiding and abetting Broumas in the fraudulent 
trading of stock.  The Commission further concluded that 
Voss had failed reasonably to supervise Graham with a view 
to preventing the securities violations.  Graham challenges 
the Commission's findings on several grounds;  Voss' chal-
lenge depends solely upon the exoneration of Graham.  Be-
cause we conclude that the Commission's decision was reason-
able and supported by substantial evidence, we deny the 
petition for review and affirm the SEC's order.

                                I

     Voss is the owner and president of an independent discount 
brokerage firm, Voss & Co., Inc. (VCI), located in Springfield, 
Virginia.  Graham began working in the securities industry in 
1982 and joined VCI in September of 1984.  She was a 
registered representative,1 as well as VCI's cashier and back 
office assistant.  She was also VCI's primary "house" broker, 
handling house accounts on a noncommission basis as well as 
some 250 of her own accounts for commissions.  See J.A. at 
371-72.2  Graham spent the bulk of her time performing

     1 A representative is a person associated with a National Associ-
ation of Securities Dealers (NASD) member firm who is engaged in 
supervision, solicitation, or conduct of securities business.  The 
NASD requires that representatives of member firms register with 
the Association and pass a qualifying exam.  See 6 Louis Loss & 
Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation 2809-11 & n.42 (3d ed. 1990).

broker.  Commissions on trades in these accounts were paid to the 
firm rather than to the brokers executing the trades.

cashiering and back office duties.  In February of 1990, she 
received her principal's license.3  Graham's immediate super-
visor, James Pasztor, was VCI's vice-president, general man-
ager, and SEC compliance officer.

     One of the firm's house accounts was a joint account in the 
names of John Broumas and his wife, Ruth.  Broumas' trou-
bles began when the stock market crashed in 1987.  To cover 
his losses, he borrowed heavily and by May 1989 owed 
roughly $2 million in personal loans and $1 million in mort-
gages.  See id. at 180-85.  Unable to borrow any more from 
banks, Broumas launched upon a scheme that the SEC 
described as "similar to check-kiting."  Sharon M. Graham, 
Release No. 34-40727, 68 S.E.C. Docket 1934, 1998 WL 
823072, at *2 (Nov. 30, 1998).4

     Broumas held a substantial number of shares in the Class 
A common stock of James Madison, Ltd. (JML), a holding 
company for a family of banks with which he was affiliated.  
Although JML stock was listed on the American Stock Ex-
change (AMEX), Broumas undertook a series of trades in the 
over-the-counter market.  Broumas arranged wash trades 
and matched orders5 of JML stock among accounts in his own 
name and in the name of nominees whose accounts he con-

management of the [NASD] member's ... securities business."  
Markowski v. SEC, 34 F.3d 99, 101 n.1 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal 
quotation omitted).  An additional examination is required to be-
come registered as a principal.  See 6 Loss & Seligman, supra, at 
2810-11 n.42.

     5 "Wash trades," also called "wash sales," are "transactions 
involving no change in beneficial ownership."  Ernst & Ernst v. 
Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 205 n.25 (1976).  "Matched orders" are 
"orders for the purchase/sale of a security that are entered with the 
knowledge that orders of substantially the same size, at substantial-
ly the same time and price, have been or will be entered by the 
same or different persons for the sale/purchase of such security."  
Id.;  see Michael Batterman, 46 S.E.C. 304, 305 (1976).

trolled.  Broumas directed these trades among at least 25 
different brokerage accounts he controlled at 14 different 
broker-dealers.  In each case, he would instruct one broker to 
buy and another to sell a specified number of shares at a 
specified price, thus moving the stock from one of his (or his 
controlled) accounts to another.  See J.A. at 211.  Neither 
broker was told by Broumas that the other account also 
belonged to or was controlled by him.

     Broumas' stock was held in margin accounts.6  Under the 
rules applicable to those accounts, Broumas could obtain the 
proceeds from a sale one day after the transaction was 
completed, but could wait at least five business days until the 
settlement date to pay for the corresponding purchase.  See 
Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *2;  see also 12 C.F.R. s 220.4 
(1989).  When the settlement date arrived, Broumas some-
times executed another set of wash trades or matched orders 
to obtain the funds he needed to make the payment--as if he 
were playing a fiscal version of "musical chairs."7

     As Broumas' financial situation continued to deteriorate, 
"many of the broker-dealers with which he dealt ... bec[ame] 
increasingly reluctant to extend him credit."  Graham, 1998 
WL 823072, at *2.  Broumas then began to effectuate wash 
and matched trades through accounts in the names of rela-
tives and business associates.  The trades in these nominee

     6 In a margin account:

          the broker lends the customer money to allow him to pur-
          chase securities.  The customer advances only a portion of 
          the purchase price and pays interest on the balance.  The 
          broker maintains the securities purchased as collateral.  If 
          the value of the securities declines, the broker may seek 
          more collateral for the protection of his "loan."
          
Liang v. Dean Witter & Co., 540 F.2d 1107, 1109 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 
1976).

     7 Broumas testified that the proceeds available to him during 
the settlement period allowed him to "take care of my bank notes or 
whatever was pressing me that day and then worry about how I 
was going to handle the purchase price and the amount of the 
purchase price a week later."  J.A. at 209.

accounts were placed by Broumas or at his direction with 
funds he provided and for his benefit.  Between January 1, 
1989 and June 30, 1990, Broumas effectuated 203 sets of wash 
and match trades in JML stock, involving a total of 420 
trades.  Each trade typically involved the purchase and sale 
of between 3,000 and 12,000 JML shares.  See id.

     Seventy-six of the directed trades were conducted by VCI, 
and approximately 60 of those--an average of one every 
week-and-a-half--were executed by Graham.  At the begin-
ning of 1989, Broumas' joint account at VCI held 37,500 
shares of JML stock.  From January 23, 1989 through May 
24, 1990, Broumas instructed VCI to exchange a total of 
644,800 shares.  Although Broumas' account was a "house" 
account, a rapport soon developed between Broumas and 
Graham and he began to ask for her specifically.  Generally, 
Broumas would give Graham a specific number of shares to 
trade, a particular limit price, the name of the firm ("contra-
broker") that would execute the other side of the trade, and 
the name of the broker he wanted her to contact at that firm.  
After consulting the AMEX listing to verify that the order 
price was within the listed bid and offer prices, Graham would 
complete the trade.  Broumas usually asked VCI to issue a 
check for the proceeds the day after the sale.  See id. at *3.

     Graham observed that Broumas "had a peculiar way of 
trading."  J.A. at 306.  Of the 100 house accounts she han-
dled during this time, only Broumas directed trades, and only 
Broumas traded in such large quantities.  See id. at 285.  
Because Broumas always identified the specific contact per-
sons to call at the contra-brokers, Graham came to believe 
that Broumas controlled the shares in the accounts or at least 
"had connections" with them, id. at 382, although Broumas 
never told her so and she "never asked him," id. at 286-87.  
Finally, from her work as the firm's cashier, Graham noticed 
that Broumas "never seemed to ... make any money on his 
trades."  Id. at 380, 383.  Eventually, Graham asked Brou-
mas directly why he traded in such a strange manner, and 
Broumas answered that "he owed bank notes or bank loans 
and that for him to sell the stock was an easier way for him to 

get the money to pay those loans, as opposed to having to go 
to other means."  Id. at 356-57;  see also id. at 308.8

     Due to Broumas' suspicious manner of trading, Graham 
undertook special precautions to protect her firm's financial 
interests.  She knew that Broumas had financial problems, 
that he had bounced checks, and that he often owed money on 
his joint account.  See id. at 288, 317, 343.  As a consequence, 
she feared that "Broumas' orders presented a financial risk to 
the firm."  Graham Br. at 14 (citing J.A. at 317).  Graham 
discussed Broumas' "peculiar way of trading" with her super-
visor, James Pasztor, and, as a safeguard, generally sought 
his prior approval for Broumas' trades--something she rarely 
did with respect to her other house accounts.  J.A. at 283-85, 
316-17.

     By early 1989, Broumas was having difficulty making time-
ly payment for trades through his VCI joint account.  Al-
though he had five business days to pay for a purchase, both 
Graham and Voss knew that VCI's clearing firm,9 U.S. Clear-
ing Corp., had been required to obtain "quite a few" exten-
sions of time.  Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *4 (quoting, 
without citation, J.A. at 296).  In March of 1989, the margin 
supervisor for the clearing firm told Pasztor that Broumas 
had received too many extensions, and that he thought Brou-
mas might be "check kiting" through his brokerage account.  
Pasztor agreed.  See id. at *4 & n.17.  As a consequence, the 
clearing firm imposed restrictions on Broumas' account, and 
directed Pasztor to bar trading unless the account already 
contained cleared funds or stock.  Pasztor informed Graham, 

__________
     8 At trial, Broumas claimed that he sold the shares to himself, 
rather than to a buyer on the open market, because he "wanted to 
maintain [his] position [in JML] at that price."  J.A. at 212.

     9 A clearing broker performs "back office services such as 
clearing stock, handling customer funds, holding customer securi-
ties, dealing with transfer agents, and matching of trades with the 
exchanges and market makers" for firms that do not have the 
capacity to perform these functions.  SEC Br. at 18 n.17;  see, e.g., 
United States v. Russo, 74 F.3d 1383, 1386 (2d Cir. 1996).

Voss, and Broumas that the account was restricted.  See id. 
at *4.

     Thereafter, Broumas called Voss and asked to open a 
second account, entitled "Les Girls," purportedly for a part-
nership between Broumas' wife and daughter.  Voss agreed 
to permit the opening of the new account, although he never 
spoke to Broumas' wife or daughter and testified that he 
"suspected" Broumas would be advising on the trading.  J.A. 
at 564.  Graham completed the form to open the "Les Girls" 
account, although she had never spoken to Broumas' wife or 
daughter either.  Graham conceded that she regarded the 
account as belonging to Broumas, and that she knew he 
placed all the trades.  Although she believed Broumas had 
opened the Les Girls account to prevent the restricted joint 
account "from being closed out or his position sold out," id. at 
295-96, Graham nonetheless continued to place directed 
trades for him.  Broumas directed 40 JML stock trades 
through the Les Girls account;  between March 21 and Au-
gust 29, 1989, all of Broumas' VCI trades in JML stock were 
effected through that account.

     In February of 1990, Broumas began directing trades in 
JML stock through yet another VCI account.  These trades 
were made through an already existing house account main-
tained by his friend and attorney, Lawton Rogers.  Broumas 
called Graham to direct trades through the Rogers account;  
Graham would then call Rogers to confirm them.  Graham 
told Pasztor about the directed trades, who in turn told Voss.  
Voss said he "didn't have a problem" with the trades because 
Broumas and Rogers were "bosom buddies."  Id. at 429.

     At the beginning of April 1990, a check Broumas had given 
VCI to pay for the purchase of JML shares was returned for 
insufficient funds.  Pasztor again restricted the joint account 
and told Graham that Broumas could not trade without 
cleared funds.  Initially, Voss concurred.  At the end of April, 
however, Broumas invited Voss to lunch.  Following the 
lunch, Voss told Pasztor that Broumas could continue to 
trade.  Pasztor in turn informed Graham.  See Graham, 1998 
WL 823072, at *5.

     Eventually, Broumas became unable to satisfy his margin 
calls and failed to pay for his last trade through VCI.  
Although the firm liquidated Broumas' account, it suffered a 
loss of over $60,000.  See id.  Broumas filed for personal 
bankruptcy in early 1991.  See id. at *2 n.3.

     On September 27, 1991, the SEC filed a complaint in 
district court alleging that, from January of 1989 through 
July of 1990, Broumas violated the securities laws by execut-
ing wash trades in JML stock.  See SEC v. John G. Brou-
mas, Civ.A.No. 91-2449 (D.D.C.).  Without admitting or de-
nying the allegations, Broumas consented to the entry of a 
permanent injunction against future violations.  Subsequent-
ly, Broumas pled guilty to utilizing a check-kiting scheme to 
meet margin calls.  See United States v. Broumas, 69 F.3d 
1178, 1179-80 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

     On September 30, 1994, the SEC issued an administrative 
complaint against Graham, Voss, and Pasztor in connection 
with Broumas' trades from January 1989 through May 1990.  
Graham was charged with willfully aiding and abetting Brou-
mas' violations of two sections of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934:  section 9(a)(1), which prohibits the effectuation of 
wash trades or matched orders

     [f]or the purpose of creating a false or misleading ap-
     pearance of active trading in any security registered on a 
     national securities exchange, or a false or misleading 
     appearance with respect to the market for any such 
     security,
     
15 U.S.C. s 78i(a)(1), and section 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 
thereunder), which makes it unlawful

     [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or 
     sale of any security registered on a national securities 
     exchange ... any manipulative or deceptive device or 
     contrivance ...,
     
id. s 78j(b).  Pasztor and Voss were charged with violating 
section 15(b)(4)(E) for failing reasonably to supervise Graham 
"with a view to preventing" the violations.  Id. s 78o(b)(4)(E).  
The charges against Pasztor were severed from those against 
Voss and Graham.  The SEC subsequently found Pasztor 

liable for failure to supervise and sanctioned him with a 
three-month suspension.  See James J. Pasztor, Release No. 
34-42008, 70 S.E.C. Docket 1979 (Oct. 14, 1999).

     The charges against Graham and Voss were heard before 
an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who found Graham and 
Voss liable on all charges, suspended them from association 
with any broker or dealer for two and three months, respec-
tively, and ordered Graham to cease and desist from future 
violations.  See Sharon M. Graham, Release No. 34-82, 60 
S.E.C. Docket 2707, 1995 WL 769011, at *28 (Dec. 28, 1995).  
On appeal, the SEC held that Broumas' trading did not 
violate section 9(a)(1) because the specific manipulative intent 
required under that section had not been established, and 
hence that Graham did not aid and abet such a violation.  See 
Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *6 n.27.  However, the Com-
mission affirmed the ALJ's holding that Broumas' wash and 
matched trades violated section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 because 
they operated as a fraud upon:  a) the market for JML stock, 
by creating a deceptive appearance of market activity;  and 
b) the brokerage firms through which Broumas traded, which 
were induced to pay him money they would not have paid had 
they known the sales were not bona fide.  See id. at *5.  The 
Commission further affirmed the ALJ's findings that Graham 
aided and abetted Broumas, and that Voss failed reasonably 
to supervise, and it upheld the two- and three-month suspen-
sions.  See id. at *7, *9, *10.  Graham and Voss petition for 
review of the Commission's order.

                                II

     The securities laws provide for judicial review of SEC 
disciplinary proceedings in the courts of appeals.  See 15 
U.S.C. s 78y(a)(1).  The Commission's findings of fact, "if 
supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive."  Id. 
s 78y(a)(4);  see Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 96 n.12 
(1981).  Its other conclusions may be set aside "only if 
'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not 
in accordance with law,' 5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A)."  Wonsover v. 
SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 412 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (internal quotation 
omitted).

     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes 
it unlawful to use deceptive devices in connection with the 
purchase or sale of securities.  See 15 U.S.C. s 78j(b).  Rule 
10b-5, promulgated pursuant to section 10(b), specifically 
provides that it is unlawful for any person, in connection with 
the purchase or sale of any security:

          (a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to de-
     fraud,
     
          (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or 
     to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to 
     make the statements made ... not misleading, or
     
          (c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of busi-
     ness which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit 
     upon any person.
     
17 C.F.R. s 240.10b-5.  Although variously formulated, three 
principal elements are required to establish liability for aiding 
and abetting a violation of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5:  (1) 
that a principal committed a primary violation;  (2) that the 
aider and abettor provided substantial assistance to the pri-
mary violator;  and (3) that the aider and abettor had the 
necessary "scienter"--i.e., that she rendered such assistance 
knowingly or recklessly.  See SEC v. Fehn, 97 F.3d 1276, 
1287-88 (9th Cir. 1996);  Bloor v. Carro, Spanbock, Londin, 
Rodman & Fass, 754 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 1985);  SEC v. 
Falstaff Brewing Corp., 629 F.2d 62, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1980);  
Investors Research Corp. v. SEC, 628 F.2d 168, 178 (D.C. Cir. 
1980);  see also SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641 (D.C. Cir. 
1992).

     Graham contests all three of these elements:  She contends 
that Broumas' conduct did not constitute a violation of section 
10(b) or Rule 10b-5, that she did not substantially assist such 
a violation, and that she did not do so knowingly or recklessly.  
Graham and Voss further argue that the SEC is estopped 
from sanctioning them because the SEC and National Associ-
ation of Securities Dealers (NASD) observed Broumas' trad-
ing and failed to alert petitioners to it or identify it as a 
securities violation.  Finally, Voss argues that because Gra-
ham is not guilty of aiding and abetting, he cannot be guilty 

of failing reasonably to supervise her.  We consider these 
arguments below.

                                A

     The SEC based its conclusion that Broumas' trades consti-
tuted a fraud under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 on two 
independent theories.  First, it concluded that the trades 
constituted a fraud on the market for JML stock by creating 
a deceptive appearance of market activity.  Second, it con-
cluded that Broumas defrauded the broker-dealers through 
which he traded by causing them to remit sales proceeds to 
him that they would not have paid had they known the true 
nature of the transactions.  Although Graham challenges the 
validity of the first theory,10 we need not resolve that dispute 
because Broumas' trades clearly constitute violations under 
the second.

     As the SEC explained, Broumas, unable to obtain further 
loans from banks, arranged wash trades and matched orders 
"for the purpose of obtaining a float in a scheme similar to 
check-kiting."  Graham, 1995 WL 769011, at *4.11  Broumas' 
scheme caused the selling brokers to pay him immediately 
the anticipated proceeds from the contrived sales, payments 
they would not have made had they realized that Broumas--
with his shaky financial condition--was also on the other side 
of the transaction, promising to pay for the same stock within 

__________
     10 Graham disputes that Broumas' trades constituted a fraud on 
the market.  She argues, inter alia, that Broumas' trades were not 
material because they constituted a small percentage of the total 
volume of outstanding JML shares.  The SEC counters that the 
trades nonetheless made up a substantial proportion of the daily 
volume of trades on the days they were reported.

     11 Broumas acknowledged that he began wash trading because 
he "didn't have the credit" to meet his existing obligations, J.A. at 
174, and couldn't borrow money from a bank because he had 
"reached [his] limit," id. at 213.  He also testified that on many 
occasions he sold JML stock to himself in order to meet margin 
calls.  See id. at 205.

five days.  See Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *6.12  Indeed, 
not only did Broumas fail to disclose that he was on both 
sides of the transaction, but he also took affirmative steps to 
hide that fact--by trading through the Les Girls and Rogers 
accounts--when the clearing firm restricted trading in his 
own account.13

     As we have noted, although Broumas received payment for 
the sale immediately, he did not have to make payment for 
the "purchase" of the same shares until five days later.  Were 
he unable to make that payment--an eventuality his uncer-
tain financial condition rendered likely and which ultimately 
occurred--the selling broker (or the purchasing broker, if it 
had paid over the funds to the selling broker and received the 
stock) would be forced to cover the loss by selling the JML 
shares.  But there was no guarantee that those shares would 
cover the amount advanced to Broumas by the broker--either 
because the stock was no longer worth the price Broumas 
himself had offered a week earlier,14 or because it had never

resell securities on settlement date of reverse "repo," defendant 
"had to purchase identical securities, something which its insolvency

with fraudulent intent to pay for securities only if their market 
value increased by settlement date, and further noting that scheme 
effectively resulted in "an involuntary extension of credit without 
compliance with the margin requirements").

     13 Broumas testified that he began asking Rogers to allow him 
to direct trades through his account "[b]ecause I didn't have the 
credit and my margin calls wouldn't permit me to trade with those 
other brokers of mine."  J.A. at 174;  cf. United States v. Sayan, 
968 F.2d 55, 61 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (affirming conviction for check-
kiting and noting that "creating fictitious payees and forging en-
dorsements" constituted a material part of the fraud, because "[i]f 
[the defendant] had merely made the drafts payable to herself, the 
bank would not have granted her immediate credit").

     14 The price of JML Class A stock began to decline in February 
of 1990.  See Graham, 1995 WL 769011, at *2.  On February 2, 

been worth that amount in the first place.15  Indeed, some-
thing like this happened to VCI, which suffered a $60,000 loss 
when forced to liquidate Broumas' account after he failed to 
pay for his last transaction.16

     Graham contends that Broumas' scheme cannot violate 
section 10(b) because fraud on a broker is not fraud "in 
connection with the purchase or sale of [a] security," as 
required by the statutory language.  15 U.S.C. s 78j(b).  To 
constitute a violation of section 10(b), Graham maintains, "the 
fraud must have been perpetrated upon an actual or potential 
investor."  Graham Br. at 27.  As the brokers were never 
parties to the securities transactions, but merely executed 

__________
1990, it closed at $6 per share.  On May 24, 1990, it closed at $4 5/8.  
See J.A. at 754-55.  Broumas testified that around this time the 
"stock dropped dramatically and I had to sell a lot of things.  I was 
finding it difficult to meet those interest payments and those loan 
payments."  Id. at 188.

     15 We note that unlike a plaintiff in a private damages action, 
the SEC need not prove actual harm.  See Schellenbach v. SEC, 989 
F.3d 907, 913 (7th Cir. 1993);  SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d 706, 711 (6th 
Cir. 1985).

     16 In her reply brief, Graham contends that Broumas did not 
defraud the brokers into paying him the proceeds of the JML sales 
because he was "entitled" to the money.  Graham Reply Br. at 8.  
Graham claims that the funds Broumas received from the "sell side" 
of the transaction were the sale proceeds of his own stock, and 
therefore his own money.  The selling broker, however, did not pay 
Broumas out of the actual proceeds of the sale, but rather out of 
"proceeds" it anticipated would be paid five days later.  Unbe-
knownst to the broker, that payment would have to come from 
Broumas himself, and, if Broumas were unable to pay, the selling 
broker's recourse was against the JML stock--which may well have 
been insufficient to cover what the broker had paid out.  Of course, 
if the transaction is viewed from the "buy side," there is even less 
justification for regarding the money as Broumas' own, as the 
purchasing broker extended Broumas credit on margin to purchase 
the stock from the contra-broker.

them, Graham contends that no violation of section 10(b) was 
possible.

     Graham's argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's 
unanimous decision in United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.S. 768 
(1979).  There, the Court confronted the same challenge to a 
criminal conviction under section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act 
of 1933, which makes it unlawful for any person "in the offer 
or sale of any securities" to employ any device, scheme, or 
artifice to defraud.  15 U.S.C. s 77q(a)(1).  The defendant 
had placed sell orders for stock he did not own, gambling that 
he could make offsetting purchases at lower prices before he 
was required to deliver the stock.  Defendant did not dispute 
that he defrauded the brokers who executed the orders, but 
contended, as petitioners do here, that the statute "applies 
solely to frauds directed against investors, and not to those 
against brokers."  Naftalin, 441 U.S. at 772.

     The Court rejected the argument.  It held that the statuto-
ry phrase, "in the offer or sale of any securities," was 
intended to be "define[d] broadly," and is "expansive enough 
to encompass the entire selling process, including the sell-
er/agent transaction."  Id. at 773.  The "language does not 
require," the Court said, "that the fraud occur in any particu-
lar phase of the selling transaction," or "that injury occur to a 
purchaser."17  Id.

     Turning to the statutory purpose, Naftalin emphasized that 
"neither this Court nor Congress has ever suggested that 
investor protection was the sole purpose of the Securities 
Act."  Id. at 775.  Although "[p]revention of frauds against 
investors was surely a key part ... so was the effort to 
achieve a high standard of business ethics ... in every facet 
of the securities industry."  Id. (internal quotation omitted) 

__________
     17 The Court noted that the case would be different if it had 
been brought by private plaintiffs, because the class of plaintiffs 
who may bring private actions under Rule 10b-5 is limited to 
purchasers or sellers.  See Naftalin, 441 U.S. at 774 n.6;  see also 
United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 664-65 (1997);  Blue Chip 
Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 751 n.14 (1975);  SEC 
v. National Sec., Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 467 n.9 (1969).

(second alteration in original);  see United States v. O'Hagan, 
521 U.S. 642, 658-59 (1997) (reaching same conclusion regard-
ing s 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act).  Moreover, the 
Court continued, "the welfare of investors and financial inter-
mediaries are inextricably linked--frauds perpetrated upon 
either business or investors can redound to the detriment of 
the other and to the economy as a whole."  Naftalin, 441 U.S. 
at 776.

     Although Naftalin involved section 17(a)(1) of the Securi-
ties Act, rather than section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange 
Act, the relevant language is virtually identical.  Compare 15 
U.S.C. s 77q(a)(1) ("in the offer or sale of any securities"), 
with id. s 78j(b) ("in connection with the purchase or sale of 
any security").  Indeed, the Court recognized an argument 
that section 17(a)(1) might be narrower than section 10(b), 
but held that "even if 'in' were meant to connote a narrower 
group of transactions than 'in connection with,' " it would still 
cover fraud against brokers.  Naftalin, 441 U.S. at 773 n.4.  
Naftalin's application to the broader wording of section 10(b) 
is, therefore, a fortiori.  This point is further confirmed by 
the Supreme Court's subsequent description of Naftalin as 
having "appl[ied] s 17(a) of the 1933 Act to conduct also 
prohibited by s 10(b) of the 1934 Act," Herman & MacLean 
v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 383 (1983), and by its recent 
affirmation that section 10(b) "does not confine its coverage to 
deception of a purchaser or seller of securities," O'Hagan, 521 
U.S. at 651.  See also SEC v. Jakubowski, 150 F.3d 675, 680 
(7th Cir. 1998) (noting that Naftalin was "a case under s 17 
of the 1933 Act, which requires proof that the fraud occurred 
'in' an offer or sales of securities--a tighter link, one might 
suppose, than 'in connection with' ") (citation omitted);  A. T. 
Brod & Co. v. Perlow, 375 F.2d 393, 396-97 (2d Cir. 1967) 
(holding that s 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 apply to frauds against 
brokers).

     Graham also contends that there cannot have been an 
actionable fraud in this case because the SEC charged owners 
and brokers at the contra-firms with securities violations like 
those of petitioners.  "Clearly," Graham declares, "Broumas' 
alleged aiders and abettors cannot also be his defrauded 

victims."  Graham Br. at 26.  This argument, too, is of no 
avail.

     First, even assuming that such a defense were valid, the 
SEC did not charge all of the contra-brokers with securities 
violations.18  Second, this purported defense has no applica-
tion to the clearing firms--none of which played any role in 
Broumas' scheme and one of which expressly tried to restrict 
it.  Broumas, assisted by Graham and Voss, established and 
traded through the Les Girls and Rogers accounts specifically 
to avoid those restrictions, thus deceiving the clearing firm 
into making the advances necessary to execute his transac-
tions.  See Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *3-*4;  Richard D. 
Chema, Release No. 34-40719, 68 S.E.C. Docket 1911, 1998 
WL 820658, at *3 (Nov. 30, 1998) (concluding that Broumas 
also defrauded another broker-dealer's clearing firm into 
advancing funds);  see also United States v. Russo, 74 F.3d 
1383, 1388, 1390 (2d Cir. 1996) (upholding conviction under 
s 10(b) where scheme involved generating false cash credits 
from clearing broker).19

     Finally, whatever the involvement of the brokers or own-
ers, fraud on their corporate institutions is an independent 
matter.20  As the Supreme Court recognized in Naftalin, 

__________
     18 Broumas' wash trades involved a total of 14 different broker-
dealers.  The VCI trades involved eight different firms, while the 
SEC instituted administrative proceedings against four.  See Gra-
ham, 1998 WL 823072, at *3 n.14.

     19 Like the other brokers, the clearing firm was exposed to the 
risk that funds it advanced might not have been repaid at the time 
Broumas became insolvent.  Although the clearing broker might be 
able to recover against the introducing firm in the event of nonpay-
ment, it would incur transaction costs in so doing--and there was 
always the risk that Broumas' scheme would bankrupt one of the 
broker-dealers involved.  See Richard D. Chema, 1998 WL 820658, 
at *4-*5.

     20 Cf. Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 
U.S. 6, 12 (1971) (holding that s 10(b) applies to fraud on corpora-
tion by controlling stockholder, and that "the fact that creditors of 
the defrauded" corporation "may be the ultimate victims does not 

fraud on brokerage firms affects more than the health of 
those firms alone.  See Naftalin, 441 U.S. at 776.  When the 
music stops, the firm left without a chair (payment or collat-
eral) does not simply leave the game.  "Losses suffered by 
brokers," whether or not covered by insurance, "increase 
their cost of doing business, and in the long run investors pay 
at least part of this cost through higher brokerage fees."  Id. 
Equally important, fraud against brokers may "create a level 
of market uncertainty that could only work to the detriment 
of both investors and the market as a whole."  Id.  Accord-
ingly, we have no warrant for overturning the SEC's determi-
nation that Broumas violated section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

                                B

     Having concluded that Broumas' stock-kiting scheme con-
stituted a primary violation of the securities laws, the next 
question is whether Graham substantially assisted Broumas 
in that violation.  We have no doubt that she did.  Graham 
placed 60 directed trades for Broumas, an average of one 
every week-and-a-half during the 18-month period at issue.  
She opened the Les Girls account and executed wash trades 
from both that account and from the account of Lawton 
Rogers.  Such conduct is more than sufficient to constitute 
substantial assistance.  See SEC v. U.S. Envtl., Inc., 155 F.3d 
107, 112 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding trader who recklessly execut-
ed manipulative buy and sell orders for customer liable as 
primary violator).

     Graham contends that this conclusion is inconsistent with 
our decision in Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F.2d 27 
(D.C. Cir. 1987).  She describes Zoelsch as a case in which we 
dismissed an aiding and abetting claim against an accounting 
firm, "which had issued an audit report with respect to 
corporate financial statements" but had "played no role in the 
use of certain figures from those statements in a prospectus 

__________
warrant disregard of the corporate entity") (footnote omitted);  
United States v. Saks, 964 F.2d 1514, 1518-19 (5th Cir. 1992) 
(affirming finding of intent to defraud banking institution, notwith-
standing bank officers' collusion with customer).

and no role in the publication of any misleading financial 
statements."  Graham Br. at 31.  In fact, the accounting 
firm's relationship to the misleading financial statements was 
even further removed than Graham describes,21 but the dis-
tance reflected in her description suffices to distinguish that 
case from this one:  unlike the accounting firm in Zoelsch, 
Graham did play a role--and a substantial one--in Broumas' 
deceptive trades.

     Graham further contends that she may not be regarded as 
substantially assisting Broumas since the execution of his 
trades was merely a "ministerial" act on her part.  She had 
"no discretion" with respect to the handling of Broumas' 
accounts, she asserts, because "once Mr. Pasztor approved a 
trade, [she] could not refuse to execute it."  Id. at 14.  But 
Graham did have discretion.  A registered representative can 
always refuse to execute a trade she knows may constitute a 
securities violation.  Cf. U.S. Envtl., 155 F.3d at 112 ("Like 
lawyers, accountants, and banks who engage in fraudulent or 
deceptive practices at their clients' direction, [the defendant 
broker] is a primary violator despite the fact that someone 
else directed the market manipulation scheme.").  Of course, 
doing so might have made Graham's career at VCI more 
difficult, but fear of such consequences does not excuse a 
violation of the securities laws.

                                C

     The real question here concerns the third element of aiding 
and abetting liability:  did Graham assist Broumas with the 
requisite scienter?  We have held that knowledge or reckless-
ness is sufficient to satisfy that requirement.  See Kowal v. 
MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 
1994);  SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641 (D.C. Cir. 1992);  
Zoelsch, 824 F.2d at 36;  Dirks v. SEC, 681 F.2d 824, 844-45 
(D.C. Cir. 1982), rev'd on other grounds, 463 U.S. 646 (1983).  

__________
     21 The defendant accounting firm had not issued the audit 
report, but rather had provided information to another accounting 
firm that had prepared the report.  See Zoelsch, 324 F.2d at 34;  see 
also id. at 28-29, 35-36.

We are satisfied that Graham acted with at least extreme 
recklessness in aiding Broumas' stock-kiting scheme.

     The SEC did not hold Graham reckless merely for execut-
ing stock trades.  Rather, during the course of executing 
some 60 trades, Graham noticed numerous suspicious circum-
stances.  She observed that Broumas invariably specified the 
contra-broker for his trades, rather than using American 
Securities, the firm VCI typically contacted for over-the-
counter trades in exchange-listed securities.  Out of the more 
than 300 accounts with which Graham worked, only Broumas 
specified the contra-broker with whom to execute the trade, 
and only Broumas traded in such large volumes.  He also 
detailed every aspect of the trade, including the specific 
employee at the contra-broker with whom he wanted Graham 
to speak.  Cf. United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1046 (2d 
Cir. 1976) (recognizing directed trades as evidence of manipu-
lation).  Graham testified that, as a result, she assumed 
Broumas controlled the shares in the accounts or at least 
"had connections" with them.

     Perhaps most important, Graham recognized, and discussed 
with Pasztor, the fact that Broumas had "a peculiar way of 
trading."  J.A. at 306.  Although these were "big money 
trades" involving thousands of shares, and although he was 
repeatedly buying and selling and paying commissions on the 
transactions, Graham realized that Broumas was not making 
any money on the trades.  See id. at 380.  This economically 
irrational trading was a large red flag.  See Edward J. 
Mawod & Co. v. SEC, 592 F.2d 588, 595 (10th Cir. 1979) 
(holding that broker willfully aided and abetted manipulative 
wash and match trades scheme when he "knew or had reason 
to know that such trading was economically irrational").

     At the same time that she was noting these trading pecu-
liarities, Graham also knew that Broumas was experiencing 
financial difficulties.  She learned that he was buying and 
selling JML stock as a method of borrowing money he needed 
to repay bank loans.  She knew that he was having trouble 
paying for his trades on time, had received "quite a few" 

extensions on his joint account, and had bounced checks.  
J.A. at 288, 296, 343.  She knew that VCI's clearing firm had 
imposed restrictions on his joint account.  And she knew that, 
with her help, Broumas was circumventing those restrictions 
by trading in accounts nominally owned by others.  More-
over, when it came to her own firm's financial interests, 
Graham took special precautions to protect against financial 
loss, seeking Pasztor's authorization on almost every trade 
because "I couldn't take a chance of writing an order when 
the man would owe thousands of dollars in his account."  Id. 
at 317.  All of this provides more than the "substantial 
evidence" necessary to support the SEC's finding of scienter 
on the part of Graham.

     In her defense, Graham notes that she "stood to gain 
absolutely nothing from Broumas' scheme," since Broumas 
traded through a "house account" for which she did not 
receive commissions.  Graham Br. at 27.  It is true that lack 
of opportunity for personal gain may suggest lack of motive, 
which may in turn be relevant to the question of scienter.  
But the absence of commissions does not necessarily negate 
either motive or scienter.  Graham may have gone along with 
Broumas' scheme (or hidden her head in the sand) to please 
her bosses or to keep her job.  Or she may have done so 
merely because she was reckless, regardless of any motive to 
gain money or favor.  Either way, the absence of commis-
sions does not absolve her of responsibility.  See U.S. Envtl., 
155 F.3d at 112 ("[A]s long as [broker], with scienter, effected 
the manipulative buy and sell orders, [his] personal motiva-
tion for manipulating the market is irrelevant in determining 
whether he violated s 10(b).").

     Graham also points to the fact that she sought and obtained 
approval for Broumas' trades from her immediate supervisor, 
James Pasztor, who told her they were "fine."  She "left it up 
to my supervisor," she states, to "say that this was not 
allowed."  J.A. at 338.  And she argues that this reliance 
negates the scienter necessary for an aiding and abetting 
violation.  In support, Graham cites James L. Owsley, a case 
in which the Commission excused the conduct of a broker 
who, prior to selling his own stock in a company, was told by 

a firm official with whom he consulted that it was not 
necessary to disclose those sales to customers he was asking 
to purchase the same stock at the same time.  See 51 S.E.C. 
524, 528 (1993).

     The SEC rejected Graham's reliance defense, noting that 
she is an experienced professional who has an independent 
duty to use diligence "where there are any unusual factors."  
Graham, 1998 WL 823072, at *6-*7 & n.30 (quoting Alessan-
drini & Co., Inc., 45 S.E.C. 399, 406 (1973)).  Registered 
representatives are "under a duty to investigate," Hanly v. 
SEC, 415 F.2d 589, 595 (2d Cir. 1969) (internal quotation 
omitted), and "red flags and suggestions of irregularities 
demand inquiry as well as adequate follow-up and review," 
Frederick H. Joseph, 51 S.E.C. 431, 438 (1993).  See Wons-
over, 205 F.3d at 411.  Given the abundance of red flags here, 
it would be very hard to characterize Graham's conduct as 
anything but extremely reckless, regardless of the approvals 
she received from Pasztor.

     The Commission distinguished the Owsley decision on the 
ground that, "[a]mong other things, ... [it] involved a single, 
discrete inquiry and limited transactions."  Graham, 1998 
WL 823072, at *7 n.34.  Nor did Owsley mention the pres-
ence of any suspicious circumstances or red flags.  By con-
trast, this case involved 60 transactions over 18 months, with 
Graham's involvement becoming increasingly more significant 
(e.g., through the establishment of the Les Girls account and 
the use of the Rogers account) at the same time that the 
warning signs were becoming increasingly more prominent.

     Graham's reliance on Pasztor, a VCI employee, also differs 
substantially from the reliance at issue in SEC v. Steadman, 
where we held that directors of a mutual fund company had 
not been reckless in relying on a "formal, unqualified opinion 
letter" from their outside counsel--an opinion also relied 
upon by the funds' "disinterested independent auditor," a 
major national accounting firm.  967 F.2d at 642.  There 
were no red flags in evidence in Steadman, nor were there 
suspicious events creating reasons for doubt.  Indeed, there 
was no evidence at all that the directors were on notice of the 

violation at issue, which arose from a failure to register the 
funds' securities under state Blue Sky laws, other than the 
SEC's view that "[s]ophisticated professionals like Steadman 
might be assumed to have come across [such] information ... 
at some point during" their careers.  Id.

     Graham, by contrast, was not simply a professional who 
should have known better.  She was a professional who was 
aware of her customer's financial difficulties, aware that he 
was trading in a suspicious and economically irrational man-
ner, and aware that he was trying to circumvent restrictions 
that had been placed on his account--yet she assisted him 
nonetheless.  Cf. Wonsover, 205 F.3d at 411, 415 (holding, in 
light of "several 'red flags,' " that broker's reliance on approv-
al of firm and its lawyers did not negate finding that he acted 
willfully).  Accordingly, we reject Graham's reliance defense 
and affirm the SEC's determination that she recklessly, and 
substantially, assisted Broumas in violating the securities 
laws.22

                                D

     Finally, Graham and Voss argue that the SEC is barred by 
principles of "equitable estoppel" and "administrative inter-
pretation" from sanctioning them.  They note that, "[f]rom 
late 1988 through mid-1989, the NASD had several occasions 
to review Broumas' directed trading in JML shares."  Gra-
ham Br. at 33.  The NASD concluded, petitioners assert, 
"that so long as Broumas' trades were not reported to the 
consolidated transaction reporting system of the exchanges, 

__________
     22 Commissioner Johnson dissented from the finding of liability 
against Graham, solely on the ground that her reliance on the 
advice of Pasztor and Voss was reasonable. See Graham, 1998 WL 
823072, at *11-*12 (Johnson, Comm'r, dissenting).  Even he, how-
ever, found the case an "exceedingly close call[ ]," which "necessari-
ly depend[ed] on the facts and circumstances."  Id.  While each 
SEC Commissioner may make his or her own factual determina-
tions de novo, our standard of review requires deference to the 
determinations of the Commission where they are supported by 
substantial evidence.

they were not manipulative."  Id.23  They also claim that 
"[t]he NASD sought the SEC's view with respect to this 
administrative interpretation and the SEC concurred."  Id.  
And they further contend that during 1988 and 1989, the SEC 
conducted its own examination of Broumas' trading, and "did 
not perceive" securities violations.  Id. at 34.

     At the start, it is important to describe accurately what 
transpired during the examinations in question.  First, the 
NASD did not give Broumas' trades anything like a clean bill 
of health, and certainly did not do so in the form of an 
"administrative interpretation."  An examiner simply con-
cluded, in an internal review, that because Broumas' trades 
were not being included in the consolidated transaction re-
porting system, see supra note 23, they did not violate an 
NASD rule that proscribes wash trades undertaken for the 
purpose of creating the false appearance of market activity, 
see NASD Manual, Sched. G, s 4(b) (1989).  The examiner 
was nonetheless troubled by the trades "because they didn't 
smell right.  There was something fishy about these trades 
being prearranged, directed trades...."  J.A. at 610;  see 
also id. at 616-17.  The NASD referred the matter of Brou-
mas' trading to the SEC for further investigation.  See id. at 
608, 618, 804.

     The SEC's role was even less formalized, and is of even 
less comfort to petitioners.  The support petitioners cite for 
the proposition that "[t]he NASD sought the SEC's view with 
respect to this administrative interpretation and the SEC 
concurred" is no more than the NASD examiner's testimony 
that he spoke to someone at the SEC--whose name and title 
he could not recall--who "basically agreed" with his evalua-
tion.  Id. at 610, 611.  The support for petitioners' contention 
that the SEC "did not perceive" securities violations in re-
viewing Broumas' trading is the testimony of an SEC examin-

__________
     23 NASD rules require that most transactions in stocks listed on 
the AMEX be reported on the "Consolidated Tape," NASD Manual, 
Sched. G, ss 1(d), 2 (1989), which is the "consolidated transaction 
reporting system for the dissemination of last sale reports in [such] 
securities," id. s 1(b).  Broumas' trades often were not reported.

er, who said that after reviewing the NASD examination, he 
decided that "no conclusion could be reached as to whether 
any violative activities have occurred."  Id. at 802.  The SEC 
examiner therefore recommended that a "further review of 
Mr. Broumas's activities should be conducted in order to 
determine if insider trading or a check kiting scheme was 
being perpetrated."  Id. at 803;  see also id. at 659.  Further 
review by the SEC eventually did result in the complaints at 
issue here.

     Even in circumstances where the doctrine of estoppel is 
applicable,24 the following elements, at least, must be estab-
lished:  that there was a "definite" representation to the party 
claiming estoppel;  that the latter "relied on its adversary's 
conduct in such a manner as to change his position for the 
worse";  and that the reliance was "reasonable."  Heckler v. 
Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 59 (1984) (internal 
quotations and footnote omitted).  Here, neither the NASD 
nor the SEC made any representations at all to Graham or 
Voss, and petitioners do not assert that they acted in reliance 
on any such representations.  Nor did either entity issue any 
kind of opinion or "administrative interpretation" that might 
have bound it, even as a matter of precedent, in a future 
adjudication.25

     24 See Heckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 60 
(1984) ("[I]t is well settled that the Government may not be 
estopped on the same terms as any other litigant.");  see also Office 
of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 419, 421-22 
(1990).

     25 Of course, even if the NASD had done something to bind 
itself, that would not have bound the SEC.  As a private, nonprofit 
corporation, the NASD conducts its own independent investigatory 
and disciplinary actions, and is subject to limited review by the 
SEC.  See 15 U.S.C. s 78s;  6 Loss & Seligman, supra, at 2819-30.  
There is "no statutory, regulatory, or historical reference to support 
[an] argument that NASD discipline of its members was intended to 
preclude ... disciplinary action by the SEC itself against a securi-
ties professional."  Jones v. SEC, 115 F.3d 1173, 1179 (4th Cir. 
1997).

     Instead, what we have in this case is nothing more than a 
series of investigations into Broumas' trades, which ultimately 
provided the SEC with sufficient understanding of the under-
lying scheme to file the complaint now before us.  Neither 
Broumas nor the petitioners can be said to have been cleared 
along the way.  And the SEC's failure to prosecute at an 
earlier stage does not estop the agency from proceeding once 
it finally accumulated sufficient evidence to do so.26

estoppel argument where there was "no evidence the Commission 
learned all the facts of the violation" at early meetings with 
petitioners);  Capital Funds, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 582, 588 (8th Cir. 
1965) (rejecting argument that the SEC was estopped because it 
previously investigated but took no action);  SEC v. Culpepper, 270 
F.2d 241, 248 (2d Cir. 1959) (finding that routine examination 
provided "no fact-basis for an estoppel" because "neither the Com-
mission nor its staff directly or indirectly caused the defendants to 
understand that it concurred in the legality of the [subject] sales");  
G.K. Scott & Co., 51 S.E.C. 961, 966 n.21 (1994) ("A regulatory 
authority's failure to take early action neither operates as an 
estoppel against later action nor cures a violation.") (internal quota-
tion omitted), review denied, 56 F.3d 1531 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (table 
decision);  cf. 15 U.S.C. s 78z ("No action or failure to act by the 
Commission ... in the administration of this chapter shall be 
construed to mean that the particular authority has in any way 
passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, any security or any 
transaction or transactions therein....").

     In Klein v. SEC, 224 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1955), cited by petitioners, 
the Second Circuit held that after an NASD committee had exam-
ined a broker's 50% markup and found no violation, it could not 
sanction him for charging the same markup two years later because 
the prior review "justified [the broker] in believing that a 50% 
markup did not violate the Rules."  Id. at 864.  The court regarded 
the NASD's earlier determination as "an interpretation of the Rules 
on which [the broker] reasonably relied."  Id.  Klein is of no 
assistance to petitioners, however, as they make no claim of reliance 
on the SEC's initial investigation.  In any event, the Second Circuit 
subsequently appeared to limit Klein to actions of the NASD, 
holding that because the SEC enforces an "Act of Congress," it 
could not "be estopped even if it had acquiesced in" a transaction 

                               III

     We conclude that substantial evidence supports the SEC's 
determination that Graham aided and abetted Broumas' viola-
tions of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  Because Voss' defense 
rested solely upon the exoneration of Graham, we also uphold 
the SEC's determination that he failed reasonably to super-
vise her.  The order of the SEC is

                                        Affirmed.
