     Before:  Williams, Sentelle and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  Over the 1990s, and even farther 
back, vitamin manufacturers allegedly fixed prices on bulk 
vitamin sales in violation of the antitrust laws.  By September 
1999 a Department of Justice investigation had secured guilty 
pleas from several major suppliers.  Dozens of private anti-
trust actions followed, and by late November 1999 approxi-
mately 49 cases were pending before the district court.

     At a status conference for all interested parties on Novem-
ber 3, 1999, counsel for the proposed representatives of a 
broad class of purchasers revealed that they had reached a 
tentative settlement that would dispose of the class's claims 
against seven of the defendants (who together with their 
affiliates account for more than 90 percent of the bulk vita-
mins market).  The then-draft agreement contained a so-
called "most favored nation" ("MFN") clause, requiring de-
fendants to hike their payments to the class in the event that 
within two years of that date they reached a more favorable 
settlement with a plaintiff who had opted out of the class.  
See Settlement Agreement p p 1, 22.  Appellants--who were 
then presumptive members of the class but who have since 
opted out--moved to intervene under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 24 for the limited purpose of opposing the MFN 
clause.  They argued--reasonably enough--that the clause 
would make it harder for them to arrive at an independent 
settlement, because it would raise the cost to defendants of 
any more favorable agreement.  The district court denied the 
appellants' motion to intervene but granted them leave to 
participate as amici curiae.  Appellants filed timely notices of 
appeal from denial of the motion to intervene.

     While this appeal was pending, appellants all chose to opt 
out of the class action.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. (Apr. 3, 2000), at 
4.  The district court held its final hearing regarding class 
certification and the proposed settlement, and on March 31, 
2000 certified the class and approved the settlement.  Neither 
of those decisions is at issue in this appeal.

     In rejecting appellants' motion for intervention, the district 
court reasoned that they lacked standing to challenge the 
settlement agreement on the grounds asserted.  We agree.

                             *  *  *

     Appellants focus on their claim to intervention as of right.  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) allows such interven-
tion for anyone who "claims an interest relating to the ... 
transaction which is the subject of the action and ... is so 
situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical 
matter impair or impede [his] ability to protect that interest, 
unless [his] interest is adequately represented by existing 
parties."  Id.  Appellants argue that their interest in being 
able to opt out of the class and to " 'go it alone' unhampered 
by any judgment in the class action" qualifies as "an interest 
relating to the ... transaction which is the subject of the 
action."  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).

     But appellants trip immediately over our decision in May-
field v. Barr, 985 F.2d 1090 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  There we held 
that class members who have opted out of a 23(b)(3) class 
action have no standing to object to a subsequent class 
settlement;  by opting out they "escape the binding effect of 
the class settlement."  Id. at 1093.  We distinguished cases in 
which plaintiffs lost claims involuntarily, and concluded:

     Our decision rests on the principle that those who fully 
     preserve their legal rights cannot challenge an order 
     approving an agreement resolving the legal rights of 
     others.
     
Id.  Compare New Mexico ex rel. Energy & Minerals Dep't 
v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 820 F.2d 441 (D.C. Cir. 
1987), in which we concluded that dismissal of the intervening 

Navajo Tribe's complaint was proper because the settlement 
reached by the other parties "d[id] not serve to dispose of the 
Tribe's claims."  Id. at 445.

     Appellants point to a number of cases in which we indicated 
a willingness to construe Rule 24(a)'s "interest" requirement 
liberally.  See Cook v. Boorstin, 763 F.2d 1462, 1466 (D.C. 
Cir. 1985);  Foster v. Gueory, 655 F.2d 1319, 1324-25 (D.C. 
Cir. 1981);  Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F.2d 175, 179 (D.C. Cir. 
1969) (plurality opinion);  Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 700 
(D.C. Cir. 1967).  But of all these, only Nuesse even ad-
dressed the issue of standing.  Thus, because decisions that 
depend on a merely assumed jurisdiction have no precedential 
value on the jurisdictional issue, Steel Co. v. Citizens for a 
Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998);  Lewis v. Casey, 
518 U.S. 343, 352 n.2 (1996), only Nuesse could assist appel-
lants.  But Nuesse affords them no help, as there the court 
found on the specific facts a sufficient interest for standing in 
the stare decisis effect of a judgment, an analysis that has no 
parallel here.

     Standing, of course, is issue-specific.  See Lujan v. Defend-
ers of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 571-78 & nn.7-8 (1992).  And as 
we noted in Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 
1060 (D.C. Cir. 1998), potential intervenors must demonstrate 
"prudential" as well as constitutional standing.  Id. at 1074-
76.  In the case of statutory rights, this requires would-be 
intervenors to show that their interests are "arguably within 
the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the 
statute."  Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. 
Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970).  Even if a particular litigant 
is outside the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted, 
that litigant retains prudential standing so long as "its inter-
ests are sufficiently congruent with those of the intended 
beneficiaries that the litigants are not more likely to frustrate 
than to further ... statutory objectives."  Mova Pharmaceu-
tical, 140 F.3d at 1075 (internal quotation marks omitted).

     But as appellants' counsel admitted at oral argument, their 
interests are not congruent with the interests of the settling 
class that were in play at the time of their motion to 

intervene.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. at 13-14.  As opt-out plain-
tiffs they have no interest in the specifics of the settlement 
except for their desire to be free of a troublesome MFN 
clause.  Id. at 14.

     Appellants' MFN objection is, moreover, incongruent with 
the interests that the rules charge the district court with 
addressing.  When appellants moved to intervene, the court 
had remaining before it the questions of whether (1) the 
proposed class satisfied the prerequisites for certification 
under Rule 23(a) and (b), (2) the form and manner of notice 
satisfied Rule 23(c), and (3) the proposed settlement satisfied 
the requirements of Rule 23(e).  Appellants' arguments 
against the MFN clause have no logical relationship to any of 
these.  The first two questions are clearly irrelevant to 
appellants' claims.  Appellants do not seek to argue that the 
proposed class failed to satisfy the conditions for class certifi-
cation.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(3).  And appellants' 
Rule 23(c) arguments--which are treated more fully below--
do not challenge the form and manner of notice at all.

     On the subject of class viability an extra word is needed for 
appellant Nutra-Blend.  According to its complaint, some of 
the settling defendants compete with Nutra-Blend, selling 
mixed vitamin products at retail prices below their wholesale 
charges for the raw components and thus subjecting Nutra-
Blend to a "price squeeze."  Accordingly it has argued that 
the class representatives do not adequately represent its 
interests.  This of course sounds like the inquiry under Rule 
23(a)(4) as to adequacy of representation.  But Nutra-Blend's 
objections were not made on the premise assumed by Rule 
23(a)--namely, that the prospective class member would be 
bound by the ensuing litigation supposedly conducted on its 
behalf.1

__________
     1 We have no occasion to decide whether a party must remain 
within the class to intervene for the purposes of challenging class 
certification under Rule 23(a), (b), or settlement under 23(e).  Cf. In 
re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 115 F.3d 456, 
457 (7th Cir. 1997);  3 Herbert Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on 
Class Actions s 16.18, at 16-99 to 16-100 (3d ed. 1992).

     Of course, in passing on the proposed settlement agree-
ment, the district court has a duty under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) 
to ensure that it is fair, adequate, and reasonable and is not 
the product of collusion between the parties.  See Pigford v. 
Glickman, 206 F.3d 1212, 1215 (D.C. Cir. 2000);  Thomas v. 
Albright, 139 F.2d 227, 231 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Thus Rule 23(e) 
provides a check against settlement dynamics that may "lead 
the negotiating parties--even those with the best intentions--
to give insufficient weight to the interests of at least some 
class members."  Manual for Complex Litigation (Third) 
s 30.42, at 238-40 (1995);  see also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. 
Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621-22 (1997) (noting the dangers that 
can arise owing to the usually non-adversarial posture of a 
Rule 23(e) hearing).  But the district court's duty is to the 
class members themselves;  it lacks the power to conduct a 
free-ranging analysis as to the broader implications of the 
proposed settlement agreement.  Compare Agretti v. ANR 
Freight Sys., 982 F.2d 242, 248 (7th Cir. 1992) ("Nor do we 
know of any cases finding standing for a non-settling party 
because a settlement is allegedly illegal or against public 
policy.") (cited with approval in Mayfield v. Barr).

     Appellants' only mention of the class's interests appears in 
a footnote in which they argue that the class will not actually 
benefit from the MFN clause.  But even here they do not say 
that its inclusion actually harms the class members.  Of 
course they might argue that in securing the MFN clause the 
class representatives must have traded away some alternative 
(and real) advantage.  But that argument's force would turn 
on a showing that defendants seriously resisted the clause, on 
which appellants offer no evidence.  In fact the defendants 
may well not have much resisted, affirmatively liking a 
Ulysses-tied-to-the-mast arrangement that enables them to 
convincingly stiff opt-outs who demand more.  Cf. Decl. of 
William M. Landes at 8-9 (excerpted at Joint Appendix 246).  
In any event, appellants do not deny that their sole actual 
concern is that the MFN clause limits their ability to reach a 
settlement more lucrative than that offered to the class.  
Consequently, their arguments fall outside of the zone of 
interests protected by Rule 23(e).

     Appellants' alternative tack invokes their right to opt out, 
starting with the notice protections of Rule 23(c)(2).  But the 
rule by its terms is purely procedural.  Any substantive right 
to be free of ancillary effects flowing from a class settlement 
must be found elsewhere.

     Appellants next look to the Due Process Clause (presum-
ably of the Fifth Amendment) for their claimed right to be 
free of any effects of the class settlement.  It is, of course, 
not in dispute that notice and an opportunity to opt out are 
requirements of due process--for any party to be bound by 
the litigation.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Advisory Committee 
Notes to the 1966 Amendment for Subdivision (d)(2) ("This 
mandatory notice pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) ... is de-
signed to fulfill requirements of due process to which the 
class action procedure is of course subject.");  Ortiz v. Fibre-
board Corp., 527 U.S. 817, ___, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 2314-15;  
Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940).

     Indeed, as Mayfield makes clear, one may challenge a 
settlement agreement to which he is not a party if the 
agreement will cause him " 'plain legal prejudice,' as when 
'the settlement strips the party of a legal claim or cause of 
action.' "  Mayfield, 985 F.2d at 1093 (quoting Agretti, 982 
F.2d at 247);  see also Alumax Mill Prods. v. Congress Fin. 
Corp., 912 F.2d 996, 1002 (8th Cir. 1990) (allowing nonsettling 
defendant to challenge a partial settlement that dismissed 
with prejudice its cross-claims and stripped it of indemnity 
and contribution rights).  But the MFN clause here causes no 
plain legal prejudice.  Although the alleged injury is more 
substantial than that claimed by the nonsettling plaintiffs in 
Mayfield, here as there the nonsettling plaintiffs have fully 
preserved their "right to litigate their claims independently."  
985 F.2d at 1093.

     Other cases have turned on a similar understanding of 
"plain legal prejudice."  In Quad/Graphics, Inc. v. Fass, 724 
F.2d 1230 (7th Cir. 1983), cited with approval in Mayfield, a 
settlement required a participant not to "voluntarily" partici-
pate in the continuing litigation.  The court insisted that the 
non-settling party show "plain legal prejudice," a formula it 

took from its cases interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Proce-
dure 41(a)(2).  724 F.2d at 1231.  It found none, even though 
that party clearly had had reason to expect advantageous 
cooperation from the settling party, and the settlement re-
striction would require it to incur the burden of a lawsuit to 
extract whatever cooperation it was legally entitled to.  Id. at 
1234.  Similarly, in Agretti, 982 F.2d at 247-48, the court 
ruled that a party to a contract had no standing to challenge a 
settlement agreement in which a settling party on the same 
side agreed to declare the contract void.  Because the nonset-
tling party retained the right to assert that the contract was 
valid and enforceable, it suffered no plain legal prejudice, 
despite the obvious practical burden of having its contractual 
partner disavow the contract.  See id. at 248.  The settlement 
limitations imposed by the MFN clause are no more onerous 
than the burdens imposed on non-settling parties in these 
cases.

     Finally, we turn to appellants' argument that the district 
court abused its discretion in denying them permissive inter-
vention under Rule 24(b)(2).  Although the denial of a motion 
for permissive intervention is not normally appealable in 
itself, see Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 
571, 574 (D.C. Cir. 1997), we may exercise our pendent 
appellate jurisdiction to reach questions that are "inextricably 
intertwined with ones over which we have direct jurisdiction."  
Id. at 574-75.  Here the basis for appellants' motion for 
permissive intervention is the same as the basis for its quest 
for intervention as of right.  The two are in that respect 
inextricably intertwined.

     But there is uncertainty over whether standing is neces-
sary for permissive intervention.  Compare EEOC v. Nation-
al Children's Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (D.C. Cir. 
1998) (recounting that Rule 24(b) requires would-be interve-
nors to have "an independent ground for subject matter 
jurisdiction" on a claim or defense that shares a common 
question with the claims of the original parties), and Dia-
mond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 76 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concur-
ring) ("The words 'claim or defense' manifestly refer to the 
kinds of claims or defenses that can be raised in courts of law 

as part of an actual or impending lawsuit");  with National 
Children's Ctr., 146 F.3d at 1045-46 (noting that our circuit 
precedent avoids "strict readings of the phrase 'claim or 
defense,' allowing intervention even in 'situations where the 
existence of any nominate 'claim' or 'defense' is difficult to 
find.' " (quoting Nuesse, 385 F.2d at 704)).  And Steel Co. 
precludes us from reaching merits issues in the absence of 
jurisdiction.  See 523 U.S. at 94.  Of course if standing is 
required, then what we have said above clearly precludes 
appellants' success on this theory as well.  If it is not, then 
appellants would have to show that the trial court abused its 
discretion in denying intervention but granting them amicus 
status--enabling them to elucidate the court on their position 
with less risk of delaying the settlement.  In view of the 
unresolved standing issue, however, we think it inappropriate 
to exercise our pendent jurisdiction.
