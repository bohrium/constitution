entered an appearance.

     Before:  Randolph, Rogers and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  In this appeal, employees of the 
District of Columbia Department of Corrections claim federal 
competitive status for the purpose of retirement benefits and 
"entitlement" to federal employment.  They sued the District 
of Columbia and the United States under 42 U.S.C. s 1983, 
the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, and District of Columbia law, to 
enforce their claimed federal status in connection with the 
closing of the Lorton Reformatory, and to compel the United 
States and the District of Columbia to follow correct proce-
dures for reductions-in-force ("RIFs").  In appealing, appel-
lants contend that the district court erred in dismissing their 
claim to federal employment status under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6), and in disposing of their other claims for failure to 
exhaust, requiring them to pursue their remedies under 
District of Columbia personnel procedures.  We find no error, 
and accordingly we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.1  
By separate order we remand the order imposing monetary 

__________
     1  In light of appellants' constitutional claim, it appears that the 
district court determined, in its discretion, to exercise supplemental 
jurisdiction over appellants' claims under District of Columbia law.  
See 28 U.S.C. s 1367.  Neither the United States nor the District of 
Columbia challenge the district court's assertion of supplemental 
jurisdiction.  We note that the court has treated the Home Rule Act 
as a hybrid statute, not solely applicable to the District of Columbia 
inasmuch as it affects various federal employees and the structure 
of some federal agencies.  See Thomas v. Barry, 729 F.2d 1469, 
1471 (D.C. Cir. 1984);  28 U.S.C. s 1366.  We need not decide 
whether this alternative jurisdictional ground applies.

                                I.

     The status of employees of the District of Columbia govern-
ment has changed over the years as Congress has changed 
the nature of the local government.  Throughout at least a 
part of its existence, the District government has had a 
correctional facility, and at least prior to the establishment of 
the Mayor-Commissioner form of government under Reorga-
nization Plan No. 3 of 1967, see 32 F.R. 11669, 81 Stat. 948, 
Sec. 301 (1967), some employees of the District government 
were treated as federal officers for certain purposes.  See, 
e.g., Reid v. Covert, 351 U.S. 487, 489-90 (1956), rev'd on other 
grounds 354 U.S. 1 (1957);  Zinkhan v. District of Columbia, 
271 F. 542, 544-45 (D.C. Cir. 1921).  Whatever their previous 
status may have been, the question posed by appellant Cor-
rections Department employees requires the court to address 
their status upon enactment of the D.C. Self Government and 
Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973 ("Home Rule Act"), 
Pub. L. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774 (codified at D.C. Code ss 1-201, 
et seq. (2001)).  If appellants were District government em-
ployees at the time of enactment, then they are subject to the 
provisions of the D.C. Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act, 
D.C. Code s 1-602.01 (2001) ("Merit Act"), unless they can 
point to authority preserving their claimed federal competi-
tive status.

     Prior to enactment of the Home Rule Act, Congress estab-
lished a commission to study the District government.  See 
Act of Sept. 22, 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-405, 84 Stat. 845.  The 
Commission was referred to as both the "Little Hoover 
Commission," because it was modeled on the congressional 
commissions in the 1940s and 1950s that recommended im-
provements in the organization and management of the feder-
al government, see Report of the Nelsen Commission, H.R. 
Doc. No. 92-317, vol. II, at xv (1972), and the "Nelsen 
Commission," after its chairman, the Honorable Ancher Nel-

sen.  As part of its Report to Congress in 1972, the Commis-
sion examined the multiple personnel systems for District 
government employees and called for a comprehensive 
District-government-wide merit personnel system "geared to 
municipal needs."  Report of the Nelsen Commission, H.R. 
Doc. No. 92-317, vol. II, at 178 (1972).  It recommended that 
"[t]he District personnel system should be restructured along 
the lines of municipal rather than Federal Systems...."  Id. 
vol. II, at 550;  see also id. vol. II, at 177-78.  The Commis-
sion included in its Report a draft personnel bill, which 
proposed that "[e]mployees of the District who are serving 
with Federal competitive status shall be granted permanent 
status in the [new District-government-wide] Career Ser-
vice...."  Id. vol. III, at 275.

     The following year Congress enacted the Home Rule Act.  
See D.C. Code, History of the D.C. Code, vol. 1 (2001) at 173 
(The D.C. Self-Government and Governmental Reorganiza-
tion Act as enacted December 23, 1973).  As relevant here, 
s 422(3) of the Home Rule Act provided that the Mayor 
would administer the personnel functions for District govern-
ment departments and agencies, and that personnel legisla-
tion enacted by Congress applicable to District government 
employees would continue in force only until the Council of 
the District of Columbia enacted a District government merit 
system.  See D.C. Code s 1-204.22(3) (2001).  On October 31, 
1978, the D.C. Council adopted the D.C. Comprehensive 
Merit Personnel Act, codified at D.C. Code ss 1-601, et seq. 
(2001), ("Merit Act"), which became effective on March 3, 
1979.  See Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. Barry, 459 A.2d 
1045, 1048-49 (D.C. 1983).  Stating among its purposes the 
desire to "[c]reate uniform systems for personnel administra-
tion among the executive departments and agencies reporting 
directly to the Mayor," D.C. Code s 1-601.02(a)(2), the Merit 
Act adopted the general approach recommended by the Nel-
sen Commission.  See Nelsen Commission Report, vol. II, at 
178, 553.

     The Merit Act established a municipal personnel system 
quite apart from that of the federal government, with Career, 
Executive, and Excepted Services for "employees" perform-

ing "a function of the District government."  D.C. Code 
ss 1-603.01(3), -603.01(7), -608.01, -609.01, -610.51.  With 
exceptions inapplicable here, see D.C. Code s 1-602.01(a), 
persons employed by the District government would, as of 
January 1, 1980, "automatically transfer into the appropriate 
personnel system established [by the Merit Act]."  Id. at 
s 1-602.04(c).  At that time, personnel procedures, including 
a right to review by the D.C. Office of Employee Appeals, 
would become available to District government employees.  
See id. at s 1-606.01.  In order to ensure continuity in 
retirement benefits, the Merit Act provided that such employ-
ees first employed before October 1, 1987, would continue to 
participate in the United States Civil Service Retirement 
System, see id. at s 1-626.02;  for employees hired on or after 
that date, District retirement benefits would apply.  See id. at 
s 1-626.03.

     This background is reflected in the court's decision in 
Thomas v. Barry, 729 F.2d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  In that 
case, the court held that former United States Department of 
Labor employees whose functions were transferred to the 
District government as part of the governmental reorganiza-
tion in the Home Rule Act ceased to be federal employees 
with attendant federal employee rights and benefits once the 
Merit Act took effect.  See id. at 1473.  The employees, who 
had been career employees in the federal competitive service, 
and retained their federal civil service rights prior to enact-
ment of the Merit Act, claimed that they were entitled to 
receive the same pay increases as federal government em-
ployees.  See id. at 1470-71.  For their claim to continued 
status as federal competitive service employees, they relied 
on two provisions of the Home Rule Act:  s 204(g), see D.C. 
Code s 1-202.04, which provided that federal employees 
transferred to the District government retained their compet-
itive service rights, and s 713(d), see D.C. Code s 1-207.13, 
which provided that such transfers would not deprive the 
transferred employees of the civil service rights they held 
prior to transfer.  See Thomas, 729 F.2d at 1472.  The court 
rejected the notion that the absence in the Home Rule Act of 
an express time limit on these civil service rights was to be 

read as a continuing grant of federal benefits.  See id. at 
1473.  Rather, the court concluded that the legislative history 
of the Home Rule Act made clear that the transferred 
employees' federal civil service rights were "merely interim 
rights" that ceased to apply to the transferred employees 
upon enactment of the Merit Act.  See id.  To hold otherwise 
would "frustrate[ ] the congressional purpose of creating a 
single, autonomous personnel system."  Id. at 1474.  Because 
appellants, who do not claim to have ever been employees of 
the federal government, have a lesser claim to federal bene-
fits, Thomas would appear to be dispositive of their claims to 
federal status.

                               II.

     Appellants seek to distinguish themselves from the employ-
ees in Thomas and other District government employees by 
virtue of their claim that they perform federal duties (and 
thereby retain their federal status) because some federal 
prisoners are committed to District of Columbia prisons.  
They point to case law and various provisions of the Home 
Rule Act.  Neither source of authority supports their claims, 
however, and Thomas controls, thereby resolving appellants' 
other contentions as well.

     Appellants rely on Reid v. Covert, 351 U.S. 487, where the 
Superintendent of the D.C. Jail sought to appeal the issuance 
of a writ of habeas corpus.  The Supreme Court held that 
insofar as the Superintendent of the D.C. Jail was custodian 
of a federal prisoner, he was an "officer or employee of the 
United States" for purposes of meeting the requirement of 28 
U.S.C. s 1252 that the United States be a party to an appeal 
involving a decision that an Act of Congress was unconstitu-
tional.  See Reid, 351 U.S. at 489-90.  Appellants also rely on 
Zinkhan where this court held that the Superintendent of the 
Washington Asylum and Jail could not be held liable for 
damages for false imprisonment based on the acts of his 
subordinates over whom he had no power of appointment or 
discharge.  See Zinkhan, 271 F. at 545.  Both cases, howev-
er, concern pre-Home Rule Act District government employ-

ees.  Consequently, as Thomas makes clear, they provide no 
support for appellants' claim to federal competitive status 
after enactment of the Merit Act.  See Thomas, 729 F.2d at 
1473.  The Merit Act identified the Department of Correc-
tions as an agency under the direct administrative control of 
the Mayor, see D.C. Code s 1-603.01(17)(E), and also identi-
fied employees of the Corrections Department as among 
those employees who, if first hired after September 30, 1987, 
would be covered by the District's retirement benefits.  See 
id. at ss 1-626.03, -626.04(2)(B).  Appellants' attempt to 
distinguish themselves from other District government em-
ployees thus fails to overcome both Congress' direction that 
there be a comprehensive merit personnel system for District 
government employees, see Thomas, 729 F.2d at 1473, and 
the Merit Act's express provisions covering Corrections De-
partment employees.  The basis for their claim to continued 
federal competitive status, namely, their detention of federal 
prisoners, was rejected implicitly when Congress directed the 
new District government to enact an autonomous merit per-
sonnel act, and explicitly in the Merit Act itself, which treated 
them as District government employees.

     Appellants' reliance on other provisions of the Home Rule 
Act is no more availing.  First, they contend that the Home 
Rule Act provision barring the D.C. Council from amending 
Title 24 of the D.C. Code for four years trumps applicability 
of the Merit Act to Corrections Department employees.  Sec-
tion 602(a)(9) provided that the D.C. Council would have no 
authority to

     enact any act, resolution, or rule with respect to any 
     provision of Title 23 [of the District of Columbia code] 
     (relating to criminal procedure), or with respect to any 
     provision of any law codified in Title 22 or 24 (relating to 
     crimes and treatment of prisoners) ... during the twen-
     ty-four full calendar months immediately following the 
     day on which members of the Council first elected pursu-
     ant to this Act take office.
     
D.C. Code Ann. s 1-233(a)(9) (1999 Repl.).  This section was 
amended in 1976 to extend Congress' exclusive jurisdiction 

over the District's criminal laws from twenty-four to forty-
eight months.  See Pub. L. No. 94-402, 90 Stat. 1220, (1976) 
(codified as amended at D.C. Code Ann. s 1-233(a)(9) (1999 
Repl.)).  Appellants point in particular to s 411, see D.C. 
Code Ann. s 24-411 (1999 Repl.), which they describe in their 
brief as providing that Corrections Department employees 
are under the general direction of the Mayor-Commissioner, 
an interim post during implementation of District "home 
rule."  But this gets them nowhere.  At the time Congress 
enacted the Home Rule Act, s 411 provided only that employ-
ees at Lorton, Occoquan and the D.C. Jail would be subject to 
the supervision of the D.C. Corrections Department, with the 
Superintendent to be appointed by the then Mayor- 
Commissioner.  See D.C. Code Ann. s 24-411 (1999 Repl.).  
In any event, the express language that Congress used to 
describe the four-year bar was limited to criminal laws and 
criminal procedure, and was designed to carry out Congress' 
purposes to await the recommendations on the criminal code 
from the D.C. Law Revision Commission.  See McIntosh v. 
Washington, 395 A.2d 744, 751 (D.C. 1978).  Because Con-
gress' purpose in retaining exclusive jurisdiction for four 
years on amendments to provisions of Title 24 has nothing to 
do with employee personnel rights or benefits, appellants 
again fail to show that their personnel and retirement rights 
are distinguishable from those of employees subject to the 
Merit Act.  Although the Merit Act included provisions for 
separate personnel systems for some District employees, such 
as judges and teachers, see D.C. Code s 1-602.01, no similar 
exception was provided for Corrections Department employ-
ees.

     Second, appellants' reliance on the provision of the Home 
Rule Act that provides for work-sharing agreements with the 
United States, see D.C. Code s 1-207.31 (2001), likewise 
provides no support for their claim of continued federal 
status.  That provision neither states nor implies that District 
government employees who provide services to the United 
States government have federal personnel and retirement 
rights.  To do so would be contrary to Congress' intention to 

have an autonomous personnel system for District govern-
ment employees.  Cf. Thomas, 729 F.2d at 1474.

     For similar reasons, appellants' reliance on federal regula-
tions applying to federal government employees, see 5 C.F.R. 
ss 210.102(b), 211.102(b) and (c), 315.401-402, is misplaced;  
they are not employees of the federal government.  Lucas' 
claim that he receives retirement benefits from the U.S. Civil 
Service retirement system as a result of his employment with 
the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department from 1972-73 would 
not make him any different from District employees who 
were hired prior to 1987.  See D.C. Code ss 1-204.22(3), 
-626.02, -626.03;  Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, 459 A.2d at 
1051.  Nor can appellants find support for their claim in the 
Merit Act itself, for the Corrections Department is not a 
grant-in-aid program under D.C. Code s 1-632.07(d), but is 
an agency of the District government funded by annual 
appropriations by Congress.  See D.C. Code ss 1-201.03, 
-626.04(2)(B).

     Having failed to show that either Congress or the Merit 
Act intended to treat Corrections Department employees 
differently from other District government employees, appel-
lants' substantive claims based on their claimed federal com-
petitive status fail for the reasons stated in Thomas.  It 
follows that their constitutional claim, based on an alleged 
property right to federal competitive status, is meritless.  See 
Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-77 (1972);  Am. 
Fed'n of Gov't Employees, 459 A.2d at 1049.  Therefore, 
because appellants cannot avoid exhaustion requirements by 
raising garden-variety work-related grievances as statutory 
and constitutional claims, see Barwood, Inc. v. District of 
Columbia, 202 F.3d 290, 294 (D.C. Cir. 2000), they must 
exhaust their administrative remedies under the Merit Act 
before filing suit in court.  See D.C. Code ss 1-606.03, 
-624.04;  Washington Teachers Union Local 6 v. Bd. of Educ. 
of D.C., 109 F.3d 774, 782 (D.C. Cir. 1997);  Robinson v. 
District of Columbia, 748 A.2d 409, 411 (D.C. 2000).  Con-
trary to appellants' claim, exhaustion is not impossible.  They 
have established no right to federal employment status, and 

thus have no claim against the United States.  Further, 
District of Columbia regulations permit intervention by non-
parties before the Office of Employee Appeals.  See 6 
D.C.M.R. s 614.1, 46 D.C. Reg. 9306-07 (1999).  Appellants' 
reliance on Anjuwan v. District of Columbia Dep't of Public 
Works, 729 A.2d 883 (D.C. 1998), and Bridges v. Kelly, 84 
F.3d 470 (D.C. Cir. 1996), is misplaced as neither case excuses 
exhaustion here.  Even if these claims were exhausted, how-
ever, it is unclear how there would be federal subject matter 
jurisdiction.  Finally, appellants' claim that their collective 
bargaining agreement expired in 1997, before the RIFs oc-
curred, was not raised in the district court and thus is not 
properly before the court.  See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 
U.S. 519, 533-38 (1992);  Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees v. 
Greenberg, 983 F.2d 286, 288 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

     Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of 
appellants' amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
