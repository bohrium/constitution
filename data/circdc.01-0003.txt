     Before:  Williams, Randolph, and Tatel, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  Utility Solid Waste Activities 
Group and General Electric petition this court to vacate in 
part an alteration of the Environmental Protection Agency's 
rules regulating the use of porous substances contaminated 
by polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs").  PCBs are outstand-
ing insulators and do not burn easily--characteristics that 
make them useful in transformers, capacitors, and other 
electrical equipment.  PCBs are also carcinogenic and toxic, 
and may cause immune system suppression, liver damage, 
endocrine disruption in humans and animals and skin irrita-
tion.  These dangers are compounded by the remarkable 
stability of PCB compounds, which bioaccumulate in fatty 
tissue and are readily absorbed through the skin and respira-
tion, as well as through ingestion of animals exposed to PCBs.

     In the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"), Con-
gress singled out these chemicals for special treatment.  15 
U.S.C. ss 2601, 2605(e).  The Act forbid the "manufacture, 
processing, distribution in commerce or use" of any PCB 
except in a "totally enclosed manner." 15 U.S.C. 
s 2605(e)(2)(A).  The EPA Administrator had authority to 
waive the restriction by rule but only if it would not present 
an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.  
15 U.S.C. s 2605(e)(2)(B).  We are told that by January 1, 
1978, when these measures took effect, nearly all manufactur-
ing of PCBs had ceased.

     In 1987 EPA published a PCB Spill Policy establishing 
cleanup and decontamination standards for spills of PCBs at 
concentrations of greater than or equal to ("ò") 50 parts per 

million ("ppm") that occurred after May 3, 1987.  40 C.F.R. 
ss 761.120-761.135.1  Under the Spill Policy, solid surfaces, 
including concrete, which were cleaned to a surface concen-
tration of 10 micrograms of PCBs per 100 square centimeters 
("10 æg/100 cm2") could be used without restrictions.  See, 
e.g., 40 C.F.R. s 761.125(b)(1)(i), (c)(4)(ii).  The Spill Policy, 
including the 10 æg/100 cm2 surface standard, remains in 
effect today.

     On June 29, 1998, EPA promulgated major amendments to 
the PCB regulations ("PCB Mega Rule").  63 Fed. Reg. 
35,384 (1998).  This PCB Mega Rule set forth an additional 
option for spills of ò 50 ppm PCBs onto concrete, provided 
that the concrete could be "decontaminated" by cleaning to 10 
æg/100 cm2 PCBs, if the decontamination began within 72 
hours of the spill.  40 C.F.R. s 761.79(b)(4).2  After promul-
gation of the PCB Mega Rule, porous surfaces contaminated 
by spills of ò 50 ppm PCBs could be used without restrictions 
if they had been cleaned up in accordance with the PCB Spill 
Policy or decontaminated in accordance with s 761.79.  See 
40 C.F.R. ss 761.20(c)(5) and 761.30(u).

     During the development of the PCB Mega Rule, the ques-
tion whether PCB contaminated surfaces that did not meet 
the cleanup or decontamination standards could be used was 
the subject of extensive public comment and inquiry by EPA.  
See 63 Fed. Reg. at 35,398;  Informal Public Hearing Disposal 
of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (June 6-7, 1995), at 87-88, 

__________
     1 The PCB Mega Rule states that regulatory provisions applying 
to PCBs at concentrations ò 50 ppm also apply to surfaces contami-
nated with PCBs at surface concentrations ò 10 æg/100 cm2.  40 
C.F.R. s 761.1(b)(3).

     2 There are certain differences between this decontamination 
provision and the Spill Policy.  The former is available only for 
spills onto concrete and includes a different response time (72 hours 
as opposed to 48 hours in the Spill policy).  Compare 40 C.F.R. 
s 761.79(b)(4) and 40 C.F.R. s 761.125(b)(1)(iii), (c)(1).  Both, how-
ever, use the 10 æg/100 cm2 surface cleanup standard.  Further, the 
Spill Policy is an enforcement policy, not a regulation.  40 C.F.R. 
s 761.135.

100-01;  Comments of Chemical Manufacturers Association, 
USWAG and NEMA on proposed PCB Mega Rule at 26-28;  
EPA Response to Comments Document at 41 (May 1998).  
Commenters pointed out that, under EPA's interpretation of 
the TSCA, buildings with PCB-contaminated porous surfaces 
(e.g., with concrete or wooden walls or floors) could not be 
used, even if the risks from exposure were trivial, unless the 
contaminated surfaces were removed.  Id.

     Responding to these comments, EPA promulgated 40 
C.F.R. s 761.30(p) to authorize the continued use of porous 
surfaces contaminated by spills of PCBs "regulated for dis-
posal" (i.e., PCBs at concentrations ò 50 ppm), provided 
certain cleaning, painting and marking conditions were met.3

     The scope of s 761.30(p) established by the PCB Mega 
Rule was:

     (p)  Continued use of porous surfaces contaminated 
          with PCBs regulated for disposal by spills of liquid 
          PCBs.4
          
     (1)  Any person may use porous surfaces contaminated 
          by spills of liquid PCBs at concentrations of ò 10 
          æg/100 cm2 for the remainder of the useful life of the 
          surfaces and subsurface material if the following 
          conditions are met:....
          
40 C.F.R. s 761.30(p) (1998).  Under this provision, the re-
quirements in s 761.30(p)--i.e., the cleaning, painting and 
marking requirements--were triggered when (1) a porous 
surface was contaminated by a spill of PCBs "regulated for 
disposal" (i.e., concentrations ò 50 ppm PCBs), and (2) the 
spill resulted in a PCB surface concentration of greater than 
10 æg/100 cm2.  EPA explained:

__________
     3 The use conditions in s 761.30(p), including the cleaning, mark-
ing and painting requirements, are set forth at 40 C.F.R. 
s 761.30(p)(1)(i)-(iii).

     4 Spills of PCBs at concentrations ò 50 ppm "constitute the 
disposal of PCBs" and are regulated under EPA's PCB program 
(referred to as PCBs "regulated for disposal").  See 40 C.F.R. 
s 761.50(a)(4).

     EPA agrees with comments that the removal of porous 
     materials contaminated by spills of liquid PCBs is eco-
     nomically burdensome and unnecessary where release of 
     and exposure to the PCBs can be controlled.  EPA 
     believes that the use conditions specified in s 761.30(p) 
     will effectively prevent exposure to any residual PCBs in 
     the contaminated porous material and therefore contin-
     ued use of this material will not present an unreasonable 
     risk.
     
63 Fed. Reg. at 35,398.  In other words, surfaces that were 
contaminated at PCB concentrations ò 10 æg/100 cm2 did not 
pose an unreasonable risk if they were cleaned, painted and 
marked in accordance with s 761.30(p).  Unlike the Spill 
Policy and the concrete decontamination provision, cleanup 
did not have to occur within a set time period.  Compare 40 
C.F.R. s 761.79(b)(4) and 40 C.F.R. s 761.125(b)(1)(iii), (c)(1);  
see also supra note 2.

     On June 24, 1999, without notice and comment, EPA 
amended the PCB Mega Rule.  EPA called the changes 
minor technical amendments.  64 Fed. Reg. at 33,756.  The 
amendment challenged here repealed the threshold criterion 
in s 761.30(p)(1) that PCBs had to be present on the porous 
surface at a surface concentration of ò 10 æg/100 cm2 to 
trigger the exposure controls.  The revised text of 
s 761.30(p)(1) reads as follows:

     (p)  Continued use of porous surfaces contaminated 
          with PCBs regulated for disposal by spills of liquid 
          PCBs.
          
     (16) Any person may use porous surfaces contaminated 
          by spills of liquid PCBs at concentrations ò 50 ppm 
          for the remainder of the useful life of the surfaces 
          and subsurface material if the following conditions 
          are met....
          
40 C.F.R. s 761.30(p)(1) (emphasis added).

     The original triggers for s 761.30(p) were a PCB concen-
tration per unit of volume spilled (i.e.,ò 50 ppm) that 
resulted in a PCB surface concentration per unit of area (i.e., 

ò 10 æg/100 cm2).  The new trigger is now based solely on 
the PCB concentration in the material spilled.  The resulting 
surface concentration and potential exposure level thus be-
came immaterial.

                                I.

     The Administrative Procedure Act's general rulemaking 
section, 5 U.S.C. s 553, sets down certain procedural require-
ments with which agencies must comply in promulgating 
legislative rules:  there must be publication of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking;  opportunity for public comment on the 
proposal;  and publication of a final rule accompanied by a 
statement of the rule's basis and purpose.  See Vermont 
Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 523-24 
(1978).  That EPA did not comply with the notice and com-
ment requirements of APA s 553 in amending s 761.30(p) is 
certain.  The question is whether EPA's justifications for not 
doing so will save the amended rule.

                                A.

     EPA represents to us that it altered s 761.30(p) in order to 
correct language resulting from an erroneous use of the Word 
Perfect find/replace command in the drafting of the regula-
tion.  Declaration of Dr. John H. Smith at 2 (June 23, 2000).  
We will accept this explanation.  The question remains 
whether EPA needed to comply with the APA in making the 
correction.  EPA thinks not because it possesses "inherent 
power" to correct "technical errors."  It relies on a line of 
cases beginning with American Trucking Ass'ns v. Frisco 
Co., 358 U.S. 133 (1958), for the proposition that agencies may 
correct their mistakes without complying with the APA's 
procedural requirements.  Our court has never recognized 
such an "inherent power" in the rulemaking context, and we 
decline to do so now.

     The Supreme Court decision just cited dealt with the 
Interstate Commerce Commission's approval of the acquisi-
tion, by a wholly-owned subsidiary of a railroad, of operating 
rights of several motor carriers.  Id. at 135.  When the 

Commission later issued certificates of public convenience and 
necessity, it failed to include language present in its reports 
reserving to the Commission the power to impose restrictions 
and modifications.  Id. at 137.  The Commission discovered 
the oversight, reopened the acquisition proceedings, gave 
notice to the parties and, after further proceedings in which 
the parties participated, ordered the certificates modified to 
reflect this limitation.  Id. at 137-38.  The Supreme Court 
affirmed the order.  The Court noted that Fed. R. Civ. P. 
60(a) grants courts the power to correct clerical errors, and 
held that the Commission possessed the same power by 
analogy and pursuant to its broad enabling statute instructing 
the Commission to serve the "ends of justice."  358 U.S. at 
145.  "To hold otherwise would be to say that once an error 
has occurred the Commission is powerless to take remedial 
steps."  Id.  Later decisions, using the same analogy to 
judicial proceedings, have sustained an agency's inherent 
power to correct errors in an adjudication.  See Howard 
Sober, Inc. v. ICC, 628 F.2d 36, 31-42 (D.C. Cir. 1980);  
United States v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 510 F.2d 769, 772-76 
(D.C. Cir. 1975);  City of Long Beach v. Department of 
Energy, 754 F.2d 379, 387-88 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1985).

     The judicial analogy does not work here.  This was not an 
adjudication.  EPA acted in a quasi-legislative fashion.  The 
rule as initially promulgated was legislative in nature.  Con-
gress, with some regularity particularly in the tax area, 
makes technical corrections to legislation, but it does so by 
enacting corrective legislation, not by issuing an order an-
nouncing the change.  EPA is not quite so constrained.  APA 
s 553(b)(B) permits it, and other agencies, to dispense with 
notice and comment "when the agency for good cause finds 
(and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons 
therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure 
thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest."  Unlike the Frisco Supreme Court case, the 
alternative here is not that EPA would be powerless to 
correct its mistakes.  It has the power to do so, so long as it 
follows certain procedures, either those spelled out in APA 

s 553(b) for usual notice and comment rulemaking, or in the 
exception we have just quoted from APA s 553(b)(B).

     In Edison Electric Institute v. OSHA, 849 F.2d 611, 622 
(D.C. Cir. 1988), the government agreed with petitioners that 
OSHA's failure to include an exception for utilities to a 
general rule was the result of a ministerial error.  Rather 
than amending the regulation, OSHA achieved the same 
result by issuing a memorandum instructing those responsi-
ble for enforcing the rule to forbear applying it to utilities.  
Id.  The court held that this binding pronouncement inter-
preting the rule was sufficient to correct the error without an 
additional round of notice and comment rulemaking.  Id.5 
EPA reads Edison Electric to mean that an agency may 
dispense with notice and comment procedures and change 
rules to correct ministerial errors.  We think this is wrong 
for four reasons.  First, OSHA did not alter or amend the 
rule itself.  It simply instructed its regional offices not to 
enforce it against utilities.  Second, OSHA did so because--as 
the parties agreed--the rule was not intended to apply to 
utilities.  Third, the memorandum setting forth this instruc-
tion did not have to be preceded by notice and comment 
rulemaking.6  Fourth, to hold that an agency may correct 
errors in rules merely by announcing a change would be 
inconsistent with APA s 553(b)(B).

     While Edison Electric is distinguishable, Chlorine Insti-
tute, Inc. v. OSHA, 613 F.2d 120, 123 (5th Cir. 1980), seems 
not to be.7  In that case the Fifth Circuit permitted OSHA to 

__________
     5 The court dropped a cf. citation to Howard Sober, Inc. v. ICC, 
628 F.2d 36, 41-42 (D.C. Cir. 1980), a case applying the ministerial 
error exception in the adjudication context.

     6 There was no claim in Edison Electric that the enforcement 
directive was "so extreme as to amount to an abdication" of the 
agency's regulatory responsibility.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 
821, 833 n.4 (1985).

     7 We say "seems" because the court, after pointing out some of 
the differences between correcting an error in a regulation rather 
than an adjudication, stated that the parties had not discussed the 
subject.  613 F.2d at 123 n.6.  The court therefore may have meant 

correct a ministerial error in a regulation seven years after 
its promulgation.  Without explaining why, the court relied 
on the Supreme Court's Frisco decision.  We reject this view 
as unsupported by the reasoning of Frisco, and as inconsis-
tent with the APA, which contains clear and limited excep-
tions to the requirements of notice and comment.

                                B.

     In addition to its claim of inherent power to correct mis-
takes in rules, EPA contends that it brought itself within one 
or more of the APA's exceptions to notice and comment 
rulemaking.

     APA s 553(b) requires notice of any proposed rule to be 
published in the Federal Register "unless persons subject 
thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise 
have actual notice thereof in accordance with law."  5 U.S.C. 
s 553(b).  EPA's argument is that petitioners received "actu-
al notice" when EPA published the change on its Internet site 
and when it held a meeting attended by counsel for Utility 
Solid Waste Activities Group.  This court has never found 
that Internet notice is an acceptable substitute for publication 
in the Federal Register, and we refuse to do so now.  See 
Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1020 (D.C. 
Cir. 2000).  In any event, EPA has not even alleged that the 
petitioners were "named" in the Internet publication, as APA 
s 553(b) would require if this sort of notice were sufficient.  
See Rodway v. Department of Agric., 514 F.2d 809, 815 (D.C. 
Cir. 1975).  That counsel for one of the petitioners attended a 
meeting discussing the modification of s 761.30(p) is irrele-
vant.  The other petitioner, General Electric, did not attend.  
See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. FCC, 57 F.3d 1136, 1143 (D.C. 

__________
merely to assume that ministerial errors in regulations can be 
corrected without an additional rulemaking.  Chlorine may also be 
explained on the basis that the regulation contained an internal 
conflict and that the statute provided a rule of decision in such 
instances, requiring adherence to the stricter of the two standards 
in the regulation.  On that view of the case, no additional rulemak-
ing would have been necessary.  The statute took care of the error.

Cir. 1995).  EPA thus failed to provide petitioners with 
"actual notice."

     EPA also thinks it qualified for the exception to notice and 
comment rulemaking contained in APA s 553(b)(B) ("when 
the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding 
and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) 
that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest").  The claim 
is that its statement in the Federal Register accompanying 
the amendment--the amendments contained only "minor, 
routine clarifications that will not have a significant effect on 
industry or the public"--amounted to a finding of good cause 
and a statement of reasons.  There are three grounds in APA 
s 553(b)(B) for finding good cause:  notice and comment 
would be "impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest."  EPA does not tell us which of the three it 
meant to invoke, so we will discuss each.  In doing so we are 
mindful of our precedents that the "good cause" exception is 
to be "narrowly construed and only reluctantly counte-
nanced."  Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 969 F.2d 
1141, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (quoting New Jersey v. EPA, 626 
F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).  The exception is not an 
"escape clause";  its use "should be limited to emergency 
situations."  American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. Block, 
655 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1981).

     With respect to "impracticable" ground, the Attorney Gen-
eral's Manual explains "that a situation is 'impracticable' 
when an agency finds that due and timely execution of its 
functions would be impeded by the notice otherwise required 
in [s 553]," as when a safety investigation shows that a new 
safety rule must be put in place immediately.  United States 
Department of Justice, Attorney General's Manual on the 
Administrative Procedure Act 30-31 (1947);  see also Method-
ist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225, 1236-37 
(D.C. Cir. 1994);  Petry v. Block, 737 F.2d 1193, 1201 (D.C. 
Cir. 1984).  This ground for finding good cause cannot possi-
bly apply here. There is no indication that 40 C.F.R. 
s 761.30(p), as it stood before the amendment, posed any 
threat to the environment or human health or that some sort 

of emergency had arisen.  And EPA made no finding to this 
effect.

     With respect to the "unnecessary" prong of the exception, 
one court has ruled that its use is "confined to those situa-
tions in which the administrative rule is a routine determina-
tion, insignificant in nature and impact, and inconsequential to 
the industry and to the public."  South Carolina v. Block, 558 
F. Supp. 1004, 1016 (D.S.C. 1983) (internal quotations omit-
ted);  see also Texaco, Inc. v. FPC, 412 F.2d 740, 743 (3d Cir. 
1969).  This formulation comports with the explanation in the 
Attorney General's Manual that " '[u]nnecessary' refers to the 
issuance of a minor rule in which the public is not particularly 
interested."  Attorney General's Manual at 31.  EPA's 
amendment of 40 C.F.R. s 761.30(p) does not fit that mold.  
As amended, the rule greatly expanded the regulated commu-
nity and increased the regulatory burden.  In the original 
rule, porous surfaces contaminated by spills containing ò 50 
ppm PCBs were not regulated by s 761.30(p) if the resulting 
PCB surface contamination was less than 10 æg/100 cm2.  As 
we understand the new regulations, these same surfaces now 
became subject to s 761.30(p) because the 10 æg/100 cm2 
surface contamination trigger has been repealed.  While 
there may be other possible readings of this complex regula-
tory scheme, we need not reach them.  EPA's amendment 
was, without doubt, something about which these members of 
the public were greatly interested.

     As to the "public interest" ground for finding good cause, 
the Attorney General's Manual states that this "connotes a 
situation in which the interest of the public would be defeated 
by any requirement of advance notice," as when announce-
ment of a proposed rule would enable the sort of financial 
manipulation the rule sought to prevent.  Attorney General's 
Manual at 31;  see also Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 
958 F.2d 1479, 1484 n.2 (9th Cir. 1992);  Levesque v. Block, 
723 F.2d 175, 184-85 (1st Cir. 1983).  Nothing of the sort is 
present here and nothing EPA said in promulgating the 
amendment suggested that it needed to forego notice and 
comment in order to prevent the amended rule from being 
evaded.

     We therefore hold that EPA cannot take advantage of the 
exceptions contained in APA s 553(b)(B).

     We hold as well that EPA cannot be excused from compli-
ance with s 553 on the basis that its failure to engage in 
notice and comment rulemaking amounted to harmless error.  
This seems to us merely another way of saying that the 
change in the rule was unimportant, having no significant 
impact.  We have already rejected that position.  If EPA 
means instead that its error in not conducting notice and 
comment rulemaking prejudiced no one, we disagree.  Peti-
tioners have presented enough to show that on remand they 
can mount a credible challenge to the amended rule and were 
thus prejudiced by the absence of an opportunity to do so 
before the amendment.

     The amendment to 40 C.F.R. s 761.30(p), as set forth in 
the June 1999 Federal Register, constituted agency action 
"without observance of [the] procedure required by law" and, 
as such, it is "unlawful and set aside."  5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(D).

     Accordingly, the petitions for judicial review are granted.
