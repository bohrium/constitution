     Before:  Silberman, Williams and Randolph, Circuit 
Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Williams.

     Williams, Circuit Judge:  Automobile engines emit volatile 
organic compounds ("VOCs"), which together with nitrogen 
oxides ("NOX") form ozone.  Reformulated gasoline ("RFG") 
can reduce VOCs emissions compared to levels associated 
with ordinary gasoline;  but it costs more, and there is some 
concern about the nation's current RFG production capacity.  
See 42 U.S.C. s 7545(k)(6)(B) (1994) (creating special provi-
sions that operate in the event of insufficient capacity).  In 
guiding the efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency 
to limit ozone concentrations, Congress in the Clean Air Act 
(the "Act") authorized limited reliance on RFG.  It directed 
that RFG should initially be mandatory in the nine worst 
ozone areas with populations over 250,000, with any area later 
classified as "Severe" to be added as well.  See 42 U.S.C. 
s 7545(k)(1), (5), (10)(D).  And it also provided for "opt-in," 
i.e., for election by a state to demand an EPA ban on the sale 
of non-RFG in specified areas.  But Congress carefully limit-
ed the eligible areas:

     Upon the application of the Governor of a State, the 
     Administrator shall apply the prohibition [on the sale of 
     non-reformulated gasoline] in any area in the State clas-
     sified ... as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious, or Severe 
     Area....
     
Act s 211(k)(6)(A), 42 U.S.C. s 7545(k)(6)(A) (emphasis add-
ed).  There is a fifth category, "Extreme," to which only Los 
Angeles belongs;  there was no need to include that category 

because it was automatically covered by Congress's direct 
mandate.

     Apart from Los Angeles, most areas of the United States 
that are not in "attainment" for EPA's ozone standards 
belong to one of the four specified categories.  But for several 
reasons--mainly the interaction between Congress's (1) rules 
limiting the ability of a nonattainment area to break into the 
broad sunlit uplands of attainment, and (2) provisions govern-
ing the treatment of missing data--an area may be in "nonat-
tainment" but not in any of the four specified classes.  In 
interpreting the opt-in provision EPA decided that Congress 
meant to include not only "Marginal, Moderate, Serious, or 
Severe" areas, but also any other areas that either were 
currently out of attainment or had ever been.  The American 
Petroleum Institute ("API") has petitioned for review of the 
rule, arguing that the agency exceeded its statutory authori-
ty;  we agree.

                              * * *

     The Act requires EPA to establish and periodically revise a 
primary national ambient air quality standard ("NAAQS") for 
each air pollutant that the agency identifies as meeting 
certain criteria.  See 42 U.S.C. ss 7408-7409.  The primary 
NAAQS for each pollutant is the maximum concentration 
"requisite to protect the public health" with "an adequate 
margin of safety."  42 U.S.C. s 7409(b)(1).  In 1979 the EPA 
administrator set a primary NAAQS for ozone at 0.120 parts 
per million ("ppm"), averaged over intervals of one hour.  See 
44 Fed. Reg. 8202.  That level was upheld by this court in 
American Petroleum Inst. v. Costle, 665 F.2d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 
1981), and remains in effect today.1

__________
     1  In 1997 the EPA adopted a revised ozone NAAQS of 0.08 ppm 
averaged over an eight-hour period.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 38,856 
(1997).  But in American Trucking Ass'ns v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 
1038 (D.C. Cir 1999) ("ATA"), modified on reh'g, 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. 
Cir. 1999), we granted a petition for review of that order and 
remanded to the EPA with instructions to provide an intelligible 
principle guiding its interpretation of the relevant sections of the 

     In approaching this case the most critical distinction is 
between "nonattainment" and "design value" as measures of 
compliance.  A maximum concentration, without more, leaves 
open the question of how often an area's hourly reading can 
exceed 0.120 ppm without causing the area to be out of 
compliance.  Congress adopted EPA's answer to this ques-
tion.  It decreed, "by operation of law," that each area's 
attainment status would be based on the regulatory standards 
"in effect immediately before November 15, 1990."  42 U.S.C. 
s 7407(d)(1)(C).  Under those standards (also still in effect), 
an area is allowed no more than one day a year in which its 
maximum hourly ozone concentration is greater than 0.120 
ppm.  But the exact formula is more complicated because it 
recognizes that many areas will not have data for every hour 
of the year;  it therefore uses estimates to fill this gap.  See 
40 CFR pt. 50, App. H.  The formula generates an "expected 
number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly 
average concentrations above 0.12 parts per million," id. 
s 50.9(a), and if the expected number of exceedances for a 
three-year period is greater than one, the area is in nonat-
tainment.

     In 1990 Congress also introduced, for ozone, a refinement 
based on how far each nonattainment area was from attain-
ment status, establishing different dates for compliance ac-
cording to the severity of the existing violations.  See 42 
U.S.C. s 7511(a)(1).  To group areas according to the various 
deadlines, Congress used a concept already in use by EPA, 
known as "design value," and once again adopted EPA's 
method for calculating this number.  See id. ("The design 
value shall be calculated according to the interpretation meth-
odology issued by the Administrator most recently before 
November 15, 1990.").  Much like the calculation of attain-
ment, EPA's method for determining design values also ex-
cuses one exceedance per year (e.g., the first three excee-
dances in a three-year period have no effect on the design 
value).  But it has no mechanism for generating data to fill 

__________
Act.  See ATA, 175 F.3d at 1038-40.  Thus, the 0.12 ppm, 1-hour 
standard remains in place.

gaps in monitoring:  Here, the design value is simply the 
fourth-highest daily maximum ozone concentration in an area 
over three consecutive years for which there are sufficient 
data.  See American Trucking Ass'ns v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 
1046 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("ATA"), modified on reh'g, 195 F.3d 
4 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  EPA, The Clean Air Act Ozone Design 
Value Study:  Final Report 1-3 to 1-5 (1994).

     In s 181(a)(1) of the Act Congress used design value to 
create five categories of nonattainment, with varying compli-
ance deadlines for each category:

          Marginal        0.121 to 0.138 ppm 
          Moderate       0.138 to 0.160 ppm 
          Serious          0.160 to 0.180 ppm 
          Severe           0.180 to 0.280 ppm 
          Extreme        0.280 ppm and above 
          
See 42 U.S.C. s 7511(a)(1) tbl.1.  But because Congress 
treated missing data differently for purposes of design value 
and attainment status, while every area with a known design 
value above 0.120 ppm is in nonattainment, an area may be in 
nonattainment even though its design value is 0.120 ppm or 
below.  EPA called such areas "submarginal."  See 56 Fed. 
Reg. at 56,697/2 (1991).

     Similarly, s 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 
s 7407(d)(1)(C)(i), requires areas designated nonattainment 
under portions of the previous standards, see 42 U.S.C. 
s 7407(d)(1)(C) (adopting provisions of the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1977, s 103, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. 685, 
687-88), to remain so classified because of inadequate data.  
EPA called such areas "incomplete data areas."  56 Fed. Reg. 
at 56,697/3;  cf. 42 U.S.C. s 7511e (allowing areas that can 
demonstrate compliance with the ozone NAAQS for the years 
1987-89 to have a special, "transitional," status).

     The key issue here is the application of the RFG program 
to these two types of areas, "submarginal" and "incomplete 
data."

                             *  *  *

     In the disputed rule, EPA stated that any "area currently 
or previously designated as a nonattainment area for ozone 
under 40 CFR 50.9 ... or any time later, may be included on 
petition of the governor."  40 CFR s 80.70(k);  63 Fed. Reg. 
at 52,104.  Largely because of the divergence between the 
concepts of nonattainment and design value, this rule swept 
into "opt-in" a variety of areas not belonging to the four 
categories specified by Congress--Marginal, Moderate, Seri-
ous or Severe.  We assess the validity of the rule under the 
familiar two-step process in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 
467 U.S. 837, 842-43 & nn.9 & 11 (1984).

     Chevron requires us to determine whether Congress spoke 
"to the precise question at issue."  Id. at 842.  It is hard to 
imagine how Congress could have done so more clearly.  
Acting within a universe where nonattainment and the four 
categories overlap but are distinct, Congress chose the four 
categories.  If it meant to express "nonattainment," its word-
ing was not merely a long-winded but a positively obtuse way 
of doing so.  As we said in Michigan Citizens for an Inde-
pendent Press v. Thornburgh, 868 F.2d 1285 (D.C. Cir.), aff'd 
by an equally divided court, 493 U.S. 38, 39 (1989), if Con-
gress makes an explicit provision for apples, oranges and 
bananas, it is most unlikely to have meant grapefruit.  Id. at 
1293.

     Despite the text, EPA argues that the scope of s 211(k)(6) 
is ambiguous, thus opening the door to "reasonable" interpre-
tations by EPA.  It notes that s 181(a)(1) of the Act states 
that "[e]ach area designated nonattainment for ozone ... 
shall be classified at the time of such designation ... as a 
Marginal Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe 
Area, or an Extreme Area based on the design value for the 
area."  42 U.S.C. s 7511(a)(1).  From this it infers that, 
despite the different methods for calculating design value and 
attainment status, Congress thought that no nonattainment 
area would be classified as other than Marginal, Moderate, 
Serious, Severe, or Extreme, and thus the reference to the 
first four categories in s 211(k)(6) was Congress's way of 

making the RFG program available to all nonattainment 
areas.  Because s 211(k)(6) does not prohibit the inclusion of 
nonattainment areas with design values below 0.121 or areas 
whose design values are unknown, EPA argues, it is at least 
ambiguous as to whether they may join.

     EPA seems to think that the possibility that Congress was 
unaware of the nonattainment-design value divergence sug-
gests that, had it been aware, it might have wanted EPA to 
allow nonattainment areas with incomplete data or design 
values below 0.121 ppm to require RFG.  There are two 
problems here:  the assumption of congressional ignorance is 
farfetched, and even if correct would not get EPA where it 
wants to go.

     In the normal case Congress is assumed to be conscious of 
what it has done, especially when it chooses between two 
available terms that might have been included in the provi-
sion in question.  See BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 
U.S. 531, 537 (1994) ("[I]t is generally presumed that Con-
gress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes partic-
ular language in one section of a statute but omits it in 
another.").  Sometimes (e.g., where the pieces of legislation 
are not closely linked in either codification or time of enact-
ment) this assumption may be a stretch, justifiable in part 
because its effect is to push toward coherent interpretations 
of law.  See West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 
U.S. 83, 100 (1991).  But here the assumption that Congress 
was aware of the law is sound:  the divergence between 
nonattainment and design value is the direct product of 
distinctive definitions explicitly adopted by Congress.  To 
suppose that Congress was ignorant of the divergence is to 
impute sleepwalking to the legislators.

     We have already explained how Congress expressly 
adopted differing formulae.  These formulae generate the two 
problematic categories at issue here.  First, as we recognized 
in ATA, the stringent criteria for changing an area's designa-
tion from nonattainment to attainment ensures that there can 
and will be nonattainment areas with design values below 

0.121 ppm (submarginal areas).  ATA, 175 F.3d at 1047;  42 
U.S.C. s 7407(d)(3)(E) (noting that an area cannot be redesig-
nated to attainment status until it shows compliance with the 
relevant NAAQS and that the improvement in air quality is 
due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions).  
Second, "incomplete data areas" have no hope of leaving 
nonattainment until they generate enough data to prove that 
they comply with the ozone NAAQS.  See id.  Thus, they 
must remain in nonattainment, but can secure the RFG 
option if they generate data placing them in the four congres-
sionally specified categories.  Quite sensibly, the literal read-
ing of s 211(k)(6)(A) provides RFG as an option when the 
need is clear, and only then.

     But even the ignorance assumption, were it true, would not 
support EPA's inference.  Having used words of art to 
describe areas eligible for opt-in, a hypothetically ignorant 
Congress would likely have assumed that if some areas 
turned up partly resembling the areas it specified--areas out 
of attainment but less clearly so--they would not be subject 
to RFG in the absence of new congressional action.  More 
specifically, even if Congress had thought that, as of 1990, all 
nonattainment areas under the 0.120 ozone NAAQS would 
have a recorded design value of at least 0.121 ppm, it knew 
that the formula for nonattainment status (unlike the fixed 
values for design value) was likely to change over time.  EPA 
has a continuing obligation to review and revise the NAAQS 
every five years, see 42 U.S.C. s 7409(d)(1);  ATA, 175 F.3d 
at 1049, and to redesignate attainment status accordingly, see 
42 U.S.C. s 7407(d)(1)(B).  In ATA, we noted that Congress 
had locked the categories of s 181(a)(1) into place, presum-
ably to avoid having its ozone enforcement scheme adminis-
tratively overridden by EPA as a result of such revision.  175 
F.3d at 1049-50.  The same is true here.  By basing the opt-
in provisions in s 211(k)(6) on the statutorily imposed catego-
ries in s 181(a)(1), Congress could limit the scope of the RFG 
program to areas that clearly fall within the categories of its 
choosing.2

__________
     2  In the rulemaking the EPA expressed its belief that areas in 
nonattainment for the new, more stringent ozone NAAQS, would be 

     On this record we are reluctant even to mention the 
legislative history.  "[W]e do not resort to legislative history 
to cloud a statutory text that is clear."  Ratzlaf v. United 
States, 510 U.S. 135, 147-48 (1994);  see also Sutton v. United 
Air Lines, Inc., 119 S. Ct. 2139, 2146 (1999);  United States v. 
Bost, 87 F.3d 1333, 1336 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  But it scarcely 
helps EPA.  The conference report observed, "States could 
elect to have the [RFG] requirements apply in other cities 
with ozone pollution problems."  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 
101-952, at 336, reprinted in 1 A Legislative History of the 
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, at 1449, 1786 (1993) 
[hereinafter Leg. Hist.].  But this is said simply to distinguish 
the statute's mandate of RFG for specified regions, and 
certainly does not claim that every other city with any ozone 
pollution would qualify for opt-in.  The floor debates add little 
clarity.  True, there are statements of the authors of the 
provision in question, and sponsors of the amendments gener-
ally, to the effect that "any" or "all" non-mandated ozone 
nonattainment areas could join the RFG program;  but none 
shows enough attention to the problem presented here to 
overcome the plain language of the text.  See Senate Debate 
on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Conference Re-
port, reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. at 731, 1024;  House Debate on 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Conference Report, 
reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. at 1177, 1266;  House Debate on 
H.R. 3030, reprinted in 2 Leg. Hist. at 2667, 2690.  Interest-
ingly, all the statements contain inaccuracies on another 
issue, asserting that the area makes the election, not the state 
or governor, a position with no support in the statute.  The 
colloquial language of debate is at best a rough guide to the 
intricacies of technical statutory wording.

     Similarly, the Senate and House committee reports that list 
the likely classification of nonattainment areas under 
s 181(a)(1) do not show that Congress meant to base RFG 

__________
allowed to opt into the RFG program.  See 63 Fed. Reg. 52,094, 
52,101 (1998).  The issue is temporarily moot in the light of ATA, 
but on its face such a claim seems even less well-founded than 
EPA's core position.

participation on attainment status.  Both lists classify the 
areas according to their design values.  The Senate list does 
not even mention attainment status, and is thus no evidence 
at all of congressional determination that it should control.  
See S. Rep. No. 101-228, at 35-37 (1989), reprinted in 5 Leg. 
Hist. at 8375-77.  Nor does the House Report speak of 
nonattainment.  It uses the looser term "areas violating the 
ozone NAAQS" and then lists areas by design value.  H. Rep. 
No. 101-490, at 230-32, reprinted in 2 Leg. Hist. at 3254-56.  
EPA would have us believe that the list demonstrates accep-
tance of its view that Congress really meant nonattainment 
because the table includes two areas, Jacksonville, FL and 
Waldo Co., ME, as likely to be classified as marginal areas 
despite their design values of only 0.120 ppm.  But the likely 
explanation is that the compiler mistakenly thought that 
because 0.120 was the cut-off point for "Marginal," an area 
with exactly that reading should be so classified.  Moreover, 
these lists can shed no light on the proper classification of 
areas that lack sufficient data to calculate a design value or 
even to confirm their nonattainment status.

     EPA next argues that even if the text is clear, this case 
presents one of the rare instances "in which the literal 
application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at 
odds with the intentions of its drafters."  R.G. Johnson Co. v. 
Apfel, 172 F.3d 890, 895 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotations 
omitted).  The agency appears to find absurdity because 
under the direct reading of the statute it denies opt-in to 
some areas with "continuing ozone problems."  But the argu-
ment assumes away all trade-offs.  Given the acknowledged 
cost and supply drawbacks associated with RFG, it seems 
entirely sensible to confine opt-in to areas experiencing non-
attainment with the comparative clarity implied by belonging 
to one of the four specified categories.  We see no absurdity.

     EPA offers a special argument under which it could reach 
back into history to allow opt-in for an area that once was--
but is no longer--classified as Marginal, Moderate, Serious, 
or Severe.  The statute allows opt-in for "any area in the 
State classified ... as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious, or 

Severe Area."  As a matter of sheer linguistic possibility, 
either of two explicit phrases could be understood to precede 
the word "classified":  it could read (1) "any area in the state 
[that is presently] classified ... as a Marginal, Moderate, 
Serious, or Severe Area," or (2) "any area in the state [that 
has ever been] classified as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious, or 
Severe Area."  EPA favors the second reading, but it seems 
utterly implausible.  If an area is in attainment, its historical 
design value has no relationship to its need for RFG.  If it is 
in nonattainment, but lacks sufficient data to be classified 
under s 181(a)(1), then RFG will be an option if, in the 
process of generating sufficient data to prove itself in attain-
ment, it is shown to have a design value of 0.121 ppm or 
above.  See 42 U.S.C. s 7407(d)(3)(E).

     In s 211(k)(6) Congress provided for opt-in only for areas 
classified as Marginal, Moderate, Serious or Severe.  It 
meant what it said.  Accordingly, API's petition for review is

                                                         Granted.
