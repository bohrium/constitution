     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  Nine utility members of the 
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (herein-
after "utility petitioners"),1 petition this Court for review of 
two final orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission ("FERC" or "the Commission").  These orders 
directed the owners of transmission assets entering into an 
agreement for an Independent System Operator ("ISO") to 
give up their right to file changes in tariff rates, terms, and 
conditions under section 205 of the Federal Power Act ("the 
Act"), 16 U.S.C. s 824d, and required the owners of transmis-
sion assets to modify their ISO agreements to forbid any 
owner from withdrawing without prior FERC approval pur-
suant to section 203 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. s 824b.  The utility 
petitioners contend that FERC has exceeded its statutory 
authority by requiring the owners of transmission assets to 
cede their statutory right to file rate changes under section 
205 of the Act.  They also argue that FERC lacks jurisdiction 

__________
     1 The nine petitioners are:  Atlantic City Electric Co., Baltimore 
Gas and Electric Co., Delmarva Power & Light Co., Jersey Central 
Power & Light Co., Metropolitan Edison Co., Pennsylvania Electric 
Co., PPL Electric Utilities Corp., Potomac Electric Power Co., and 
Public Service Electric and Gas Co.  Intervenor PECO Energy 
Company only joins the utility petitioners' section 205 argument.

under section 203 of the Act to require Commission approval 
for withdrawal from an ISO.  Finally, petitioner Public Ser-
vice Electric and Gas Company ("PSE&G") challenges 
FERC's order requiring the generic reformation of pre-
existing wholesale power contracts to reflect transmission 
pricing concepts available under the new regime as failing to 
comply with the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.  Because we agree 
with the petitioners on all three issues, we grant the petitions 
for review.

                          I. Background

              A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

     Section 201(b) of the Federal Power Act confers upon 
FERC jurisdiction over all rates, terms, and conditions of 
electric transmission service provided by public utilities in 
interstate commerce, as well as over the sale of electric 
energy at wholesale.  16 U.S.C. s 824(b).  Under section 205 
of the Act, the Commission is obliged to assure that the rates 
and charges demanded or received by any public utility in 
connection with the interstate transmission or sale of electric 
energy are just and reasonable, and that no public utility's 
rates will unduly discriminate against any consumers.  Id. 
s 824d(a), (b);  see NAACP v. Federal Power Comm'n, 425 
U.S. 662, 669-71 (1976).  Section 206 of the Act authorizes 
FERC to investigate, on its own motion or upon complaint, 
rates and terms of service.  See 16 U.S.C. s 824e.

     "Historically, electric utilities were vertically integrated, 
owning generation, transmission, and distribution facilities 
and selling these services as a 'bundled' package to wholesale 
and retail customers in a limited geographical service area."  
Public Utility Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Co. v. FERC, 272 
F.3d 607, 610 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("Snohomish Co.") (citation 
omitted);  see New York v. FERC, 122 S. Ct. 1012, 1016-18 
(2002).  However, by 1940, significant economic changes and 
technological advances made it possible for many new en-
trants in the generating markets to sell energy at a lower 
price than many existing generation facilities. See Snohomish 
Co., 272 F.3d at 610;  New York v. FERC, 122 S. Ct. at 1017-

18.  "But barriers to a competitive wholesale power market 
remained because if and when the existing vertically integrat-
ed utilities provided regional transmission access to these new 
efficient generating plants, they favored their own genera-
tion."  Snohomish Co., 272 F.3d at 610.  Finding that utilities 
would use their market power to deny transmission access to 
competing generation sources, FERC issued an order in 1996, 
relying upon its statutory authority under sections 205 and 
206 of the Act, see 16 U.S.C. ss 824d(b), 824e(a), requiring a 
restructuring of the power industry.  That order, Order No. 
888, required that the wholesale transmission function be 
unbundled from the sale of power and required utilities to 
provide open access to their transmission lines in a nondis-
criminatory fashion.  Promoting Wholesale Competition 
Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission 
Services by Public Utilities, Order No. 888, FERC Stats. &

2000), aff'd sub nom. New York v. FERC, 122 S. Ct.  1012 
(2002) (hereinafter "Order No. 888").

     Order No. 888, among other things, set forth the frame-
work for voluntarily creating Independent System Operators 
("ISOs"), independent companies that manage transmission 
facilities owned by utilities.  61 Fed. Reg. at 21,595-97.  ISOs 
have no financial stake in any power market participant, have 
the ability to halt generation causing transmission system 
constraints, and must provide real-time transmission informa-
tion to market participants.  Id.  The Commission empha-
sized that an ISO's independence with respect to governance 
and financial interests was fundamental to assuring that an 
ISO would not favor any class of transmission users.  Id. at 
21,596. Order No. 888 also specifically required tight power 
pools to file open access tariffs and reformed power pool 

agreements to establish open, non-discriminatory member-
ship provisions and to modify provisions that were unduly 
discriminatory or preferential.  Id. at 21,594.  Tight power 
pools are highly integrated pooling arrangements, involving a 
central dispatch, where utilities extensively coordinate their 
planning and operations.  FERC stated that power pools 
could, but were not required to, satisfy Order No. 888's 
comparability2 and nondiscrimination requirements by form-
ing a properly constructed ISO.  See id. at 21,593-94.

                    B. The PJM Interconnection

     The Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland ("PJM") Inter-
connection is a tight power pool.  See Order No. 888, 61 Fed. 
Reg. at 21,594.  The PJM power pool--the oldest and largest 
power pool in the nation--was formed as a voluntary organi-
zation comprised of investor-owned utilities that operate their 
generating and transmission facilities in a coordinated man-
ner so that regional power loads can be met reliably and 
efficiently.  It was formed in 1927, and became a "tight" 
power pool by operating as a single control area with free-
flowing transmission ties in 1956.  Under the 1956 operating 
agreement, the PJM members agreed to place their generat-
ing facilities under the control of a central system dispatcher.  
The PJM members formed the PJM Interconnection Associa-
tion in 1993, an unincorporated association which served as 
the system dispatcher, responsible for administering the PJM 
service center and control center independent of any individu-
al member of PJM.  At no point in the power pool's history 
did FERC assert jurisdiction over the power pool under 
section 203 of the Act, which provides in pertinent part:  "No 
public utility shall sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the 
whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Com-

__________
     2 Under the comparability standard, " '[a]n open access tariff that 
is not unduly discriminatory or anticompetitive should offer third 
parties access on the same or comparable basis, and under the same 
or comparable terms and conditions, as the transmission provider's 
uses of its [own] system.' "  Alliant Energy Corp. v. FERC, 253 
F.3d 748, 751 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Transmission Pricing 
Policy Statement, 59 Fed. Reg. 55,031, 55,034 (1994)).

mission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $50,000, or 
by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or 
consolidate such facilities or any part thereof with those of 
any other person, or purchase, acquire, or take any security 
of any other public utility, without first having secured an 
order of the Commission authorizing it to do so."  16 U.S.C. 
s 824b(a).

     In response to Order No. 888 the PJM members submitted 
to FERC in 1996 an open access tariff and several negotiated 
agreements that proposed to revise the PJM governance 
structure to put in place an ISO.  The utility petitioners filed 
the tariff and ISO agreement under section 205 and, at the 
same time, petitioned FERC for a declaratory order disclaim-
ing jurisdiction over the ISO agreement under section 203.  
The proposal contemplated that the PJM Interconnection 
Association would be transformed into the PJM ISO, a sepa-
rate incorporated entity, which would be responsible for 
administering operational aspects of the transmission net-
work, including dispatching generation to customers.  PJM 
utilities would continue to own and physically operate their 
transmission facilities, subject to the ISO's directives.

                       C. FERC Proceedings

     FERC asserted jurisdiction over the PJM restructuring 
under section 203, ruling that the proposal to transfer opera-
tional responsibilities to the ISO is a "disposition of jurisdic-
tional facilities" within the meaning of section 203, requiring 
FERC authorization.  Atlantic City Elec. Co., 76 F.E.R.C. 
p 61,306, at 62,513, reh'g denied as moot, 77 F.E.R.C. p 61,298 
(1996) ("Jurisdictional Order").  FERC claimed authority to 
require preapproval because "the creation of an ISO requires 
the transfer of control of the operation of the PJM transmis-
sion facilities from the transmission owners, i.e., the public 
utilities that together comprise PJM, to the ISO" and was 
thus a disposition under section 203.  Id.  Utility petitioners 
sought rehearing of this order;  however, FERC dismissed 
the rehearing petition as moot in light of its intervening order 

rejecting the restructuring proposal on its merits under sec-
tion 205.  See Atlantic City Elec. Co., 77 F.E.R.C. p 61,298 
(1996).  The utility petitioners sought review of the Jurisdic-
tional Order in this Court, and their petition was held in 
abeyance pending the conclusion of the administrative pro-
ceedings on the PJM restructuring.

     In its November 13, 1996 order on the merits, FERC 
recognized that formulating an acceptable ISO was a difficult 
task, but found that the restructuring proposal did not con-
form with the ISO principles set out in Order No. 888.  See 
Atlantic City Elec. Co., 77 F.E.R.C. p 61,148, at 61,559 (1996).  
Following the issuance of several orders by FERC providing 
guidance regarding an acceptable restructuring proposal, the 
PJM utilities submitted a revised proposal for an ISO on 
June 6, 1997.  The new governance provisions provided for 
the establishment of an independent ISO consisting of the 
PJM Office of Interconnection ("PJM-OI") and an indepen-
dent PJM Board of Managers ("PJM Board").  Under the 
Operating Agreement, the PJM-OI would administer the 
day-to-day operations of the PJM power pool, subject to the 
PJM Board's oversight.  The PJM Board would be indepen-
dent of all industry segments, thus precluding any group or 
members from asserting undue influence over the operation 
of the PJM power pool.  The ISO would administer certain 
operational aspects of the transmission network, without as-
suming physical control over the transmission assets.  The 
PJM utilities would physically operate their transmission 
facilities subject to the ISO's directives.

     The Transmission Owners Agreement provided that the 
utility owners would offer pool-wide transmission service, and 
would transfer the administration of the tariff and regional 
transmission planning and operations to the PJM-OI as the 
ISO.  The Agreement established procedures for changes to 
rate design and other tariff terms for transmission services.  
It permitted the transmission owners to file changes in 
transmission service rate design and non-rate terms and 
conditions to the tariff under section 205.  However, the 
independent PJM Board could reject a proposed change by a 

majority vote "as inconsistent with the creation and operation 
of a robust, competitive and non-discriminatory electric power 
market in the PJM Control Area."  If the proposal was not 
rejected by the PJM Board's majority, the PJM-OI would file 
the proposal with FERC on behalf of the transmission owners 
pursuant to section 205.  If the proposal were rejected by the 
PJM Board, then any PJM party or group of parties could 
submit alternative proposals to FERC pursuant to section 
206 of the Act.  Finally, both the Operating Agreement and 
the Transmission Owners Agreement provided that PJM 
members had the right to withdraw from the ISO under 
certain circumstances after giving 90 days notices to the 
PJM-OI.  No provision required parties to seek or obtain 
FERC approval before withdrawing from the ISO.

     FERC found that the revised proposal generally satisfied 
its ISO principles, and, subject to certain modifications, condi-
tionally approved the ISO structure.  Pennsylvania-New 
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,257 
(1997), reh'g denied, 92 F.E.R.C. p 61,282 (2000) ("PJM Re-
structuring Order").  The utility petitioners have sought re-
view of two of these modifications and PSE&G has sought 
review of a third. Specifically, FERC directed petitioners to 
modify the provision governing changes to rate filings under 
sections 205 and 206.  Id. at 62,279.  The utilities were 
required to eliminate a provision allowing them "to unilateral-
ly file to make changes in rate design, terms or conditions of 
jurisdictional services," except that they could still unilateral-
ly seek a change in the transmission revenue requirements.  
Id.  FERC said that all changes in rate design, terms and 
conditions of service on the utilities' facilities had to be 
developed and modified "in accordance with the governance 
process" approved in the order.  Id.  Rather than permit 
unilateral filings by the individual utilities as provided in 
section 205, FERC found that PJM-OI had the "right and 
responsibility to participate in the development of any such 
revisions and to intervene in any proceedings pertaining to 
such filings."  Id.  Thus as FERC would have it, only the 
ISO could propose changes in rate design.

     FERC also prohibited the withdrawal of utilities from the 
ISO without preclearance from the Commission.  Despite 
finding that the PJM Board possessed "the requisite indepen-
dence from the transmission owners," id. at 62,263, FERC 
suggested that members might exercise "implicit" control 
over the Board by terminating membership.  FERC directed 
the petitioners to modify the restructuring agreements to 
clarify that "any notice of termination or withdrawal from the 
agreements must be filed with the Commission and may 
become effective only upon the Commission's approval."  Id. 
at 62,265 (emphasis in original).  Thus the "90-day withdraw-
al right is effective only upon the Commission's approval."  
Id. at 62,279 (emphasis in original).

     Finally, the Commission ordered the transmission owners 
to modify any agreements under which they provided trans-
mission service to eliminate multiple transmission charges 
and to reflect that PJM-OI administers those agreements.  
Id. at 62,280-81.  Similarly FERC required the modification 
of any existing bundled wholesale power sales agreements 
that were inconsistent with the restructured PJM transmis-
sion rate arrangements.  This modification was to eliminate 
charges that the utility owners no longer had to pay.  Id. at 
62,281-82.  One agreement affected by these requirements is 
PSE&G's bundled wholesale agreement with the Old Domin-
ion Electric Cooperative ("Old Dominion").  Their agreement, 
reached in 1992, provided both parties with long-term capaci-
ty price stability, by placing strict limitations on the parties' 
rights to seek changes to the capacity rates.  PSE&G chal-
lenged FERC's decision and sought rehearing, but the Com-
mission maintained its position. Pennsylvania-New Jersey-
Maryland Interconnection, 92 F.E.R.C. p 61,282, at 61,962 
(2000) (order denying rehearing).  PSE&G petitioned this 
Court for review of the PJM Restructuring Order as well as 
the Compliance Order implementing the modification to its 
bundled wholesale power sale agreement with Old Dominion.  
Potomac Elec. Power Co., 83 F.E.R.C. p 61,162 (1998), reh'g 
denied, 93 F.E.R.C. p 61,111 (2000) ("Compliance Order").

     The Jurisdictional Order, 76 F.E.R.C. p 61,306 (1996), the 
PJM Restructuring Order, 81 F.E.R.C. p 61,257 (1997), and 
the Compliance Order, 83 F.E.R.C. p 61,162 (1998), are thus 
properly before this Court on petition for review.

                           II. Analysis

     As a federal agency, FERC is a "creature of statute," 
having "no constitutional or common law existence or authori-
ty, but only those authorities conferred upon it by Congress."  
Michigan v. EPA, 268 F.3d 1075, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2001) 
(emphasis added).  Thus, if there is no statute conferring 
authority, FERC has none.  See id.;  Louisiana Public Ser-
vice Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (recognizing 
that "an agency literally has no power to act ... unless and 
until Congress confers power upon it").  In the absence of 
statutory authorization for its act, an agency's "action is 
plainly contrary to law and cannot stand."  268 F.3d at 1081 
(citing American Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, 
1119-20 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("API");  Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 51 
F.3d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).

     "To determine whether the agency's action is contrary to 
law, we look first to determine whether Congress has delegat-
ed to the agency the legal authority to take the action that is 
under dispute."  Michigan, 268 F.3d at 1081 (citing United 
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2000)).  Where an 
administrative agency is relying on a statute committed to its 
administration for authority, we defer to that agency's inter-
pretation of the statute under the familiar two-step approach 
of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun-
cil, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), "when it appears that Congress 
delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules 
carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation 
claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that 
authority."  Mead Corp., 533 U.S. at 226-27.  Thus, even if 
an agency possesses delegated authority, if "Congress has 
directly spoken to the precise question at issue," we "must 
give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Con-
gress," and that ends this Court's inquiry.  Chevron, 467 U.S. 

at 842-43 (Chevron step one).  Where "the statute is silent or 
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for 
the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a 
permissible construction of the statute."  Id. at 843 (Chevron 
step two).  The agency's interpretation of the statute is 
entitled to deference only if it is "reasonable and consistent 
with the statute's purpose."  Independent Ins. Agents of Am., 
Inc. v. Hawke, 211 F.3d 638, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  However, 
"[m]ere ambiguity in a statute is not evidence of congression-
al delegation of authority" in the first instance. Michigan, 268 
F.3d at 1082 (emphasis added).  Rather, Chevron "deference 
comes into play of course, only as a consequence of statutory 
ambiguity, and then only if the reviewing court finds an 
implicit delegation of authority to the agency."  Sea-Land 
Serv., Inc. v. Dep't of Transp., 137 F.3d 640, 645 (D.C. Cir. 
1998) (emphasis added).

     Indeed, "[a]gency authority may not be lightly presumed.  
'Were courts to presume a delegation of power absent an 
express withholding of such power, agencies would enjoy 
virtually limitless hegemony, a result plainly out of keeping 
with Chevron [, Mead,] and quite likely with the Constitution 
as well.' "  Michigan, 268 F.3d at 1082 (quoting Ethyl Corp., 
51 F.3d at 1060).  " 'Thus, we will not presume a delegation of 
power based solely on the fact that there is not an express 
withholding of such power.' "  Id. (quoting API, 52 F.3d at 
1120).  Nonetheless, when Congress has explicitly or impli-
edly left a gap for an agency to fill, there is a delegation of 
authority to the agency to give meaning to a specific provision 
of the statute by regulation, "and any ensuing regulation is 
binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary 
and capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the 
statute."  Mead, 533 U.S. at 227;  see 5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A) 
(agency action shall be set aside if found to be "arbitrary, 
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-
dance with law").

     With this standard in mind, we turn to the case at bar.  
First we consider whether FERC had authority to require 
the utility petitioners to give up their statutory rights under 
section 205 and determine it did not.  Second we examine 

whether section 203 confers authority on FERC to require 
petitioners to modify the ISO agreement to allow withdrawal 
only upon approval by the Commission, and conclude it does 
not.  Finally, we find that FERC's requirement that pre-
existing wholesale power contracts be modified was contrary 
to law under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.

                      A. Section 205 Rights

     Section 205 of the Federal Power Act gives a utility the 
right to file rates and terms for services rendered with its 
assets. 16 U.S.C. s 824d.  The PJM members had voluntarily 
proposed a sharing arrangement on changes to rate design 
that attempted to balance the utility owners' rights and the 
ISO Board's independence.  FERC disapproved this sharing 
arrangement and directed the utility petitioners to give up all 
authority to make unilateral changes to rate design.  Peti-
tioners contend that FERC lacks the authority to require the 
utility owners to give up their statutory rights under section 
205.  We agree.

     FERC cannot point to any statute giving it authority for its 
unprecedented decision to require the utility petitioners to 
cede rights expressly given to them in section 205 of the 
Federal Power Act.  FERC finds no authority in section 205.  
Indeed, quite the contrary.  FERC is attempting to deny the 
utility petitioners the very statutory rights given to them by 
Congress.  Section 205(d) provides that a public utility may 
file changes to rates, charges, classification, or service at any 
time upon 60 days notice.  Id. s 824d(d).  FERC can then 
review those changes under section 205 and suspend them for 
a period of five months, but it can reject them only if it finds 
that the changes proposed by the public utility are not "just 
and reasonable."  Id. s 824d(e);  see Cities of Campbell v. 
FERC, 770 F.2d 1180, 1184-85 (D.C. Cir. 1985);  Papago 
Tribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F.2d 950, 952-53 (D.C. Cir. 
1983).  As the Supreme Court stated in United Gas Pipe 
Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division, 358 U.S. 
103, 113-14 (1958), the public utility, "like the seller of an 
unregulated commodity, has the right ... to change its rates 

... [at] will, unless it has undertaken by contract not to do 
so."  Section 205 (and 206) of the Act "are simply parts of a 
single statutory scheme under which all rates are established 
initially by the [public utilities], by contract or otherwise, and 
all rates are subject to being modified by the Commission 
upon a finding that they are unlawful."  United Gas Pipe 
Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Serv. Corp., 350 U.S. 332, 341 (1956) 
(emphasis added) (addressing the provisions of the Natural 
Gas Act parallel to the Federal Power Act).  Thus, FERC 
plays "an essentially passive and reactive" role under section 
205.  City of Winnfield v. FERC, 744 F.2d 871, 876 (D.C. Cir. 
1984) (Scalia, J.).

     Similarly, nothing in section 206 sanctions denying petition-
ers their right to unilaterally file rate and term changes.  
Section 206 merely permits the Commission--acting either on 
its own initiative or after a complaint--to initiate changes to 
existing utility rates and practices.  In order to make any 
change in an existing rate or practice, FERC must first prove 
that the existing rates or practices are "unjust, unreasonable, 
unduly discriminatory or preferential."  16 U.S.C. s 824e(a);  
see Alabama Power Co. v. FERC, 993 F.2d 1557, 1569 (D.C. 
Cir. 1993).  Then FERC must show that its proposed changes 
are just and reasonable.  Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. 
FERC, 860 F.2d 446, 454 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Nothing in this 
provision gives FERC the power to deny a utility the right to 
file changes in the first instance.

     The courts have repeatedly held that FERC has no power 
to force public utilities to file particular rates unless it first 
finds the existing filed rates unlawful.  See Pub. Serv. 
Comm'n v. FERC, 866 F.2d 487, 488-89 (D.C. Cir. 1989) 
(interpreting parallel provision of the Natural Gas Act, 15 
U.S.C. s 717d) ("On four occasions in the last three years this 
court has reviewed [FERC] efforts to compromise s 5's limits 
on its power to revise rates.  On each the court has repelled 
[FERC]'s gambit.  This is number five.");  Western Res., Inc. 
v. FERC, 9 F.3d 1568, 1578 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ("We now make 
it an even six.");  see also Consumers Energy Co. v. FERC, 
226 F.3d 777, 780 (6th Cir. 2000) (Natural Gas Act);  Louisi-
ana v. Federal Power Comm'n, 503 F.2d 844, 861 (5th Cir. 

1974) (same).  Nor may FERC prohibit public utilities from 
filing changes in the first instance.  Rather this Court, among 
others, has stressed that the power to initiate rate changes 
rests with the utility and cannot be appropriated by FERC in 
the absence of a finding that the existing rate was unlawful. 
Yet here, FERC purports to deny the utility petitioners any 
ability to initiate rate design changes with respect to services 
provided with their own assets.  FERC thereby eliminated 
the very thing that the statute was designed to protect--the 
ability of the utility owner to "set the rates it will charge 
prospective customers, and change them at will," subject to 
review by the Commission.  City of Cleveland v. FPC, 525 
F.2d 845, 855 (D.C. Cir. 1976).

     Of course, utilities may choose to voluntarily give up, by 
contract, some of their rate-filing freedom under section 205.  
Under the Supreme Court's Mobile-Sierra doctrine,3 parties 
may negotiate a fixed-rate contract with a provision relin-
quishing their right to file for a unilateral change in rates.  In 
this case, the parties agreed to a sharing arrangement of the 
section 205 filing responsibilities.  FERC claims that it relied 
on Order No. 888 and the "bedrock principle" of ISO indepen-
dence to require the utility petitioners to cede their section 
205 rights and mandate a different sharing arrangement.  As 
FERC believes an ISO to be a public utility within the scope 
of the Federal Power Act, and thus entitled to make section 
205 filings, FERC contends that its decision is "entirely 
reasonable, and is entitled to Chevron deference."  Yet, 
FERC's approach would turn Chevron on its head. FERC 
cannot rely on one of its own regulations to trump the plain 
meaning of a statute.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.  
While an ISO may have certain section 205 rights, there is 
simply no denying the utility petitioners' section 205 rights.  
No matter how "bedrock" the principle of ISO independence 
may be, Order No. 888 is merely a regulation.  It cannot be 

__________
     3 The doctrine derives its name from the companion cases United 
Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Serv. Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956), 
and Federal Power Comm'n v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 
353 (1956).

the basis for denying the petitioners their rights provided by 
a statute enacted by both houses of Congress and signed into 
law by the president.  While there may be some ambiguity in 
how to treat an ISO under section 205, such "ambiguity is not 
evidence of congressional delegation of authority" to set aside 
the utility petitioners' statutory rights under section 205.  
Michigan, 268 F.3d at 1082.  In sum FERC lacks the author-
ity to require the petitioners to cede their right under section 
205 of the Act to file changes in rate design with the 
Commission.

              B. FERC Jurisdiction Under Section 203

     The utility petitioners argue that FERC erred in directing 
them to modify their ISO agreements to require Commission 
approval prior to a utility's withdrawal from the ISO under 
section 203 of the Act.  Section 203 provides:  "No public 
utility shall sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of" jurisdictional 
facilities whose value exceeds $50,000 "without first having 
secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so."  
16 U.S.C. s 824b(a) (emphasis added).  FERC contends that 
the formation of the ISO is a "dispos[ition]" of facilities within 
the meaning of section 203, thus giving the Commission 
jurisdiction under that section.  We disagree.  A utility does 
not "sell, lease, or otherwise dispose" of its facilities when it 
agrees to the changes in operational control necessary to 
initially join or to withdraw from an ISO.  Therefore FERC 
exceeded its jurisdiction by directing the utility petitioners to 
modify their agreement to state that any notice of withdrawal 
from the ISO shall become effective only upon FERC approv-
al.

     When the utilities joined the PJM ISO there was no 
transfer of ownership or even physical operation of their 
facilities.  Pursuant to the operating agreement, each of the 
utilities retained both ownership and physical control of their 
facilities, but gave to the PJM ISO certain operational re-
sponsibilities relating to the provision of transmission services 
using their jurisdictional facilities.  Thus, when a PJM mem-
ber withdraws, there is again, no change in ownership, and no 

grounds for FERC to require preapproval under section 203.  
FERC contends that the word "dispose" in section 203 can be 
construed broadly to include the transfer of supervisory 
operational responsibility over facilities to the ISO.  We find 
such an interpretation to be inconsistent with a logical read-
ing of the statute and an unexplained departure from past 
FERC practice.

     First, the terms "sell" and "lease" in section 203 clearly 
contemplate a transfer of ownership or proprietary interests.  
Id.  The expression "otherwise dispose" requires a similar 
interpretation under the principle noscitur a sociis.  See Dole 
v. United Steelworkers of America, 494 U.S. 26, 36 (1990) 
("words grouped in a list should be given a related meaning");  
Neal v. Clark, 95 U.S. 704, 708-09 (1878) ("the coupling of 
words together shows that they are to be understood in the 
same sense").  Thus, the term "dispose" in section 203 can 
only reasonably be read to refer to changes or transfers in 
proprietary interests or something akin thereto.

     Second, FERC's expansive reading of its section 203 juris-
diction cannot be reconciled with section 202, which has been 
definitively interpreted to make clear that Congress intended 
coordination and interconnection arrangements be left to the 
"voluntary" action of the utilities.  See 16 U.S.C. s 824a(a).  
Section 202 provides that "the Commission is empowered and 
directed to divide the country into regional districts for the 
voluntary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the 
generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy."  Id. 
(emphasis added).  That provision does not provide FERC 
with any substantive powers "to compel any particular inter-
connection or technique of coordination."  Duke Power Co. v. 
Federal Power Comm'n, 401 F.2d 930, 943 (D.C. Cir. 1968) 
(emphasis in original);  see Central Iowa Power Coop. v. 
FERC, 606 F.2d 1156, 1167-68 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ("Given the 
expressly voluntary nature of coordination under section 
202(a), the Commission could not have mandated adoption of 
the [coordination] Agreement").  Thus, it would be anomalous 
for FERC to have jurisdiction under section 203 to prohibit 
the utility petitioners from ending their voluntary coordina-
tion and interconnection through the PJM ISO.  This does 

not mean that FERC is prohibited from reviewing entry to or 
exit from an ISO.  The petitioners are not disputing FERC's 
authority to review their agreements at the outset and to 
decide, based on the evidence in the record, whether the 
entrance and exit rights specified therein are just and reason-
able within the meaning of section 205.  Nor do petitioners 
contest FERC's authority to review a specific withdrawal 
under section 205.  Rather it is only FERC's assertion of 
jurisdiction under section 203 that is at issue.

     Third, prior to this case this Commission held a similar 
view of the limits of its own jurisdiction under section 203.  It 
observed that "Section 203 was ... designed to insure that 
transfers of utility property to, as well as from, the companies 
subject to our jurisdiction would be in the public interest."  
Duke Power Co., 36 F.P.C. 399, 402 (1966) (emphasis added), 
rev'd on other grounds, Duke Power Co. v. Federal Power 
Comm'n, 401 F.2d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1968).  Indeed, prior to this 
case, FERC had never applied section 203 where only opera-
tional control was transferred.  Cases such as Central Ver-
mont Public Service Corp., 39 F.E.R.C. p 61,295 (1987), and 
Savannah Electric & Power Co., 42 F.E.R.C. p 61,240 (1988), 
cited by FERC, are not helpful to the Commission's position 
because they involved changes in corporate ownership and 
direct control.  Central Vermont involved a transfer of own-
ership and control of jurisdictional facilities through a trans-
fer of common stock from existing shareholders to a newly 
created holding company.  Savannah Electric involved the 
transfer of all of a public utility's stock to a registered public 
utility holding company.  Indeed these cases note that there 
was a change in proprietary interest contemplated in the 
disputed transaction.  See Central Vermont, 39 F.E.R.C. at 
61,960 ("Although the current stockholders of the public 
utility will own stock in the holding company after the reorga-
nization is completed, they will no longer have a proprietary 
interest in, or direct control over, the jurisdictional facilities") 
(emphasis added);  Savannah Electric, 42 F.E.R.C. at 61,778. 
Similarly the sale/leaseback cases cited by FERC are not 
relevant because they all involve transfers of proprietary 
interests through an actual sale of facilities, which are then 

leased back to the original owner.  See Baltimore Refuse 
Energy Systems Co., 40 F.E.R.C. p 61,366 (1987).  In those 
cases there was no change in operational control at all--there 
section 203 approval was required solely because of a change 
in the legal ownership of the facilities.  Thus, if these cases 
show anything, it is that FERC's jurisdiction under section 
203 turns on changes in ownership.

     FERC's supporting intervenors argue that the transfer of 
operational control over jurisdictional facilities to the ISO is a 
"disposition" within the meaning of section 203.  Similarly, in 
the Jurisdictional Order, FERC noted that "the creation of 
an ISO requires the transfer of control of the operation of the 
PJM transmission facilities from the transmission owners ... 
to the ISO and is a disposition of jurisdictional facilities 
requiring prior Commission authorization under section 203."  
76 F.E.R.C. at 62,513.  Yet, FERC did not rely on this 
analysis in its brief before this Court, and with good reason.  
In the proceedings below, the Commission found that the 
PJM power pool was already "operated" on a coordinated 
basis, with a central dispatch, "by an independent staff re-
ferred to as the PJM Office of Interconnection (PJM-OI)." 
PJM Restructuring Order, 81 F.E.R.C. at 62,234 n.1.  Prior 
to the attempt to create an ISO, FERC never asserted 
section 203 jurisdiction over the PJM tight power pool.  The 
"operational control" exercised by the ISO is no different 
from that of its predecessor power pool.  The distinction 
suggested by the intervenors, that the PJM utilities are 
transferring control to an independent ISO rather than a 
member-controlled tight power pool, is a very thin reed.  
Moreover, although the ISO would exercise supervision over 
the daily scheduling and dispatching activities of the network 
facilities, the participating members would retain physical 
control and ownership of the transmission facilities and be 
responsible for their maintenance.  The transmission owners 
would merely transmit energy in accordance with the di-
rectives of the ISO.  Public utilities make decisions about the 
operational control of their facilities on a regular basis.  They 
give customers the right to demand capacity, they enter into 
coordination agreements, and they join together in coopera-

tive ventures that require common management.  Yet, for 
more than half a century, section 203 has never been con-
strued to give the Commission control over every such agree-
ment.  Its focus is plainly upon the disposition of the facili-
ties themselves.  As "[a]gency authority may not be lightly 
presumed," Michigan, 268 F.3d at 1082, we find that FERC's 
attempted reach under section 203 exceeds its statutorily-
defined grasp.  No "disposition" within the meaning of sec-
tion 203 is contemplated by the ISO agreements, and thus 
FERC has no jurisdiction to require preapproval under that 
provision.

               C. Generic Modification of Contracts

     Finally we turn to PSE&G's challenge to FERC's order 
requiring the generic reformation of pre-existing wholesale 
power contracts to reflect transmission pricing under the new 
ISO regime.  PSE&G contends that the Commission failed to 
make the particularized findings required under the Mobile-
Sierra doctrine.  FERC concedes that it did make a "gener-
ic" finding that existing bilateral and power sale agreements 
of PJM members had to be modified, but that such a generic 
finding was entirely appropriate because the PJM restructur-
ing plan "transferr[ed] the obligation to provide open access 
transmission services from the individual [utility owners] to 
the ISO."  PJM Restructuring Order, 81 F.E.R.C. at 62,281.  
FERC submits that a "decision to proceed generically across 
a group of contracts that were universally affected in the 
same way by the restructuring plan was reasonable."  Yet 
petitioner PSE&G had a Mobile-Sierra contract that was 
negotiated at arms length with Old Dominion and designed to 
provide both parties with long-term price certainty and 
FERC made no findings that modifications to this contract 
were required by the public interest.  Because the Commis-
sion has not made the required findings under the Mobile-
Sierra doctrine, FERC's order is contrary to law and must be 
vacated.

     Prior to the formation of the PJM ISO, transmission ser-
vice was (and in most parts of the country, still is) sold on a 

utility-by-utility basis.  If a power sale required transmission 
service over the lines of more than one utility to travel on a 
path from the power plant to the buyer, transmission service 
would be purchased separately from each intervening utility.  
Under the Commission's ISO guidelines set forth in Order 
No. 888, the transmission lines of all of the utilities that join 
an ISO are to be pooled together and sold for a single rate, 
even when a transaction uses the transmission lines of more 
than one utility.  In Order No. 888 and its progeny, FERC 
indicated that the new transmission pricing rules were to 
apply prospectively only.  Pre-existing contracts would be left 
unchanged unless the parties voluntarily agreed to an amend-
ment or the customer proved, on a case-by-case basis, that 
the facts presented by an individual contract justified a 
change.  See Order No. 888, 61 Fed. Reg. at 21,557-58.  Yet, 
in the PJM Restructuring Order the Commission ordered 
that all pre-existing contracts be modified without making 
any of the required findings under the Mobile-Sierra doc-
trine.

     Under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine FERC may abrogate or 
modify freely negotiated private contracts that set firm rates 
or establish a specific methodology for setting the rates for 
service, and deny either party the right to unilaterally change 
those rates, only if required by the public interest.  Texaco 
Inc. v. FERC, 148 F.3d 1091, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  As we 
have held, the purpose of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine is to 
preserve the benefits of the parties' bargain as reflected in 
the contract, assuming that there was no reason to question 
what transpired at the contract formation stage.  See Town of 
Norwood v. FERC, 587 F.2d 1306, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  The 
public interest standard of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine is 
much more restrictive than the just and reasonable standard 
of section 205 of the Act.  See Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. 
FERC, 210 F.3d 403, 407 (D.C. Cir. 2000);  Texaco, 148 F.3d 
at 1097.  Yet, in requiring modifications to the PSE&G-Old 
Dominion 1992 agreement, FERC failed to undertake, let 
alone satisfy, the requirements of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.  
At no time did FERC make a particularized finding that the 

public interest required the modification of the PSE&G-Old 
Dominion contract.

     FERC claims to have engaged in a fact-specific inquiry in a 
section 206 complaint brought by Old Dominion.  See Old 
Dominion Elec. Coop. v. Public Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 84 
F.E.R.C. p 61,155 (1998).  However, in that proceeding, the 
Commission did not engage in any analysis;  instead, dismiss-
ing Old Dominion's complaint, the Commission stated that 
"we are not persuaded that this docket is the proper place to 
address the issue of multiple [transmission] charges. Rather, 
the docket in which this matter should be (and, in fact, 
already has been) addressed is the PJM [Restructuring 
Order] proceeding."  Id. at 61,844.  Nor is any case-specific 
justification to be found in the PJM Restructuring Order. 
Instead, FERC simply relied on its general policy to be 
applied in ISOs that the charging of multiple, utility-specific 
transmission rates in a transaction that requires use of more 
than one utility owner's lines should be eliminated.  See PJM 
Restructuring Order, 81 F.E.R.C. at 62,281.  This is insuffi-
cient to satisfy the requirements of the Mobile-Sierra doc-
trine.  "[M]ore is required to justify regulatory intervention 
in a private contract than a simple reference to the policies 
served by a particular rule."  Texaco, 148 F.3d at 1097.  
While FERC may be "becoming hostile to Mobile-Sierra" and 
the particularized findings that doctrine requires, Boston 
Edison Co. v. FERC, 233 F.3d 60, 68 (1st Cir. 2000), the 
Commission would do well to heed its own admonition and 
"not take contract modification lightly."  Potomac Elec. Pow-
er Co. v. Allegheny Power Sys., 85 F.E.R.C. p 61,160, at 
61,632-33 (1998), aff'd, Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. FERC, 
210 F.3d 403 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

     Despite FERC's bald assertion that the transmission rate 
under the PSE&G-Old Dominion 1992 agreement was "un-
reasonable" or "discriminatory," this case involves little more 
than a party to a contract seeking to avail itself of a lower 
rate than it was entitled to under the terms of its original 
agreement.  This Court has consistently held, however, that a 
rate differential attributable to the operation of the Mobile-
Sierra doctrine, is not, by itself, enough to demonstrate that 

the public interest demands a modification to or an abroga-
tion of an existing contract.  See, e.g., Potomac Elec., 210 
F.3d at 409;  Cities of Bethany v. FERC, 727 F.2d 1121, 1139-
41 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  As FERC's decision to require the 
generic reformation of pre-existing wholesale power contracts 
to reflect transmission pricing under the new ISO regime was 
based on little else, it fails to comply with the Mobile-Sierra 
doctrine, and is hereby vacated.

                         III. Conclusion

     FERC has attempted to exert authority where it has none. 
FERC can point to no statute authorizing its requirement 
that the utility petitioners cede their statutory rights under 
section 205 of the Federal Power Act to file changes in rate 
design with the Commission.  Nor does FERC have jurisdic-
tion under section 203 of the Act to require the utility 
petitioners to modify the ISO agreement to allow withdrawal 
only upon approval by the Commission.  A utility does not 
"sell, lease, or otherwise dispose" of facilities when it agrees 
to the changes in operational control necessary to withdraw 
from (or initially join) an ISO.  Finally, FERC's requirement 
of generic reformation of pre-existing wholesale power con-
tracts, without making a particularized finding that the public 
interest requires modification of a particular agreement, is a 
violation of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.  Therefore, we grant 
the petitions for review, vacate those portions of the Jurisdic-
tional Order, PJM Restructuring Order, and the Compliance 
Order that are inconsistent with this opinion, and remand for 
further proceedings.

                                                                 So ordered.
