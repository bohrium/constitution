                         (No. 98cv00562)

     Douglas B. Jordan, Special Counsel, U.S. Department of 
Treasury, argued the cause for appellants.  With him on the 
briefs were Robert B. Serino, Deputy Chief Counsel, L. 

Robert Griffin, Director, Horace G. Sneed, Assistant Di-
rector, and F. Thomas Eck, IV, Senior Trial Attorney.

     Chrys D. Lemon, John J. Gill and Michael F. Crotty were 
on the brief for amici curiae American Bankers Association 
and Association of Banks in Insurance.

     Scott A. Sinder argued the cause and was on the brief for 
appellees.

     Before:  Sentelle, Henderson and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Circuit Judge Henderson concurs in the result.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge:  In 1864, Congress granted na-
tional banks the power to "exercise ... all such incidental 
powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of 
banking."  Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, s 8, 13 Stat. 99, 101 
(codified at 12 U.S.C. s 24 (Seventh) (1994)).  Fifty-two years 
later, Congress enlarged that grant by conferring the power 
to act as general insurance agents to national banks located in 
towns with a population not in excess of five thousand.  See 
Act of Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 461, 39 Stat. 752, 753-54 (codified at 
12 U.S.C. s 92 (1994)).  In 1999, Congress further enlarged 
bank powers by allowing financial subsidiaries of "well capi-
talized and well managed" national banks to engage in a wide 
variety of insurance activities both as an agent and broker.  
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Pub. L. No. 106-102, ss 103(a), 
121, 113 Stat. 1338, 1342-50, 1373-81 (1999).

     The Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency ("Comptrol-
ler" or "OCC"), defendant-appellant here, determined in 1997 
that all national banks may sell as agent general casualty 
insurance to protect against the risk of crop loss, under sole 
authority of the original 1864 grant of power.  Appellees, 
Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc., National 
Association of Professional Insurance Agents, Inc., National 
Association of Life Underwriters, National Association of 
Mutual Insurance Companies, and Crop Insurance Research 
Bureau (collectively "IIAA"), filed suit in the district court 
claiming that this interpretation was incorrect as a matter of 
law.  The district court agreed and granted summary judg-

ment for appellees in an order signed March 23, 1999.  See 
Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc. v. Hawke, 43 F. Supp. 
2d 21 (D.D.C. 1999).  The Comptroller appeals, joined by two 
associations representing banking interests as amici curiae.  
We affirm.

                          I. Background

                            A. History

     National banks, being creatures of statute, possess only 
those powers conferred upon them by Congress.  See Texas 
& Pac. Ry. Co. v. Pottorff, 291 U.S. 245, 253 (1934);  First 
Nat'l Bank of Charlotte v. National Exch. Bank of Baltimore, 
92 U.S. 122, 128 (1875).  The National Bank Act of 1864, Act 
of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, 13 Stat. 99 (codified as amended in 
scattered sections of 12 U.S.C.), as amended, provides for the 
chartering of national banks.  As part of this statutory re-
gime, 12 U.S.C. s 24 (Seventh) confers the following powers 
upon national banks:

     [National banks shall have the power] [t]o exercise ...  
     all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry 
     on the business of banking;  by discounting and negotiat-
     ing promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other 
     evidences of debt;  by receiving deposits;  by buying and 
     selling exchange, coin, and bullion;  by loaning money on 
     personal security;  and by obtaining, issuing, and circulat-
     ing notes....
     
12 U.S.C. s 24 (Seventh) (1994).  The most pertinent phrase 
to this case is "all such incidental powers as shall be neces-
sary to carry on the business of banking";  the following 
enumeration of powers is only illustrative and the Comptrol-
ler may authorize additional activities if encompassed by a 
reasonable interpretation s 24 (Seventh).  See NationsBank 
v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 258 n.2 (1995) 
("VALIC");  American Ins. Ass'n v. Clarke, 865 F.2d 278, 
281-82 (D.C. Cir. 1988).

     The Comptroller's authority to confer "all such incidental 
powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of 

banking" has been interpreted to mean powers "convenient or 
useful in connection with the performance of one of the bank's 
established activities pursuant to its express powers...."  
Arnold Tours, Inc. v. Camp, 472 F.2d 427, 432 (1st Cir. 1972).  
Whether a particular banking device's nomenclature harkens 
to traditional banking activities is not dispositive.  Instead, 
the "powers of national banks must be construed so as to 
permit the use of new ways of conducting the very old 
business of banking."  M&M Leasing Corp. v. Seattle First 
National Bank, 563 F.2d 1377, 1382 (9th Cir. 1977).

     For example, in M&M Leasing, the Ninth Circuit upheld 
the Comptroller's determination that national banks may 
"lease" personal property when the transaction is functionally 
identical to a secured loan.  See id. at 1380, 1383.  Similarly, 
in American Insurance Association, we held that national 
banks may offer "municipal bond insurance" which was actu-
ally the functional equivalent of a standby letter of credit, a 
traditional banking device.  See 865 F.2d at 281-84.

     In Independent Bankers Ass'n of America v. Heimann, 
613 F.2d 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1980), we recognized the right of 
national banks to offer "credit life insurance."  That product 
names the bank as beneficiary, not the bank customer, and is 
a principal form of security for consumer loans.  We noted 
that "[u]nlike other forms of insurance coverage ... credit 
life insurance is a limited special type of coverage written to 
protect loans."  Id. at 1170.  Because credit life insurance is 
"essential where ordinary loans on personal security are 
involved" and does not "involve the operations of a general 
life insurance business," we approved of the activity.  Id.;  see 
also First Nat'l Bank of Eastern Arkansas v. Taylor, 907 
F.2d 775 (8th Cir. 1990) (upholding authority of banks to sell 
"debt cancellation contracts" to extinguish loan debts in the 
event of death).

     Even in light of the interpretations of s 24 (Seventh) 
upheld in the above cases, however, when the OCC has 
undertaken to authorize national banks to sell general forms 
of insurance it has run into trouble.  In 1916, Comptroller 
John Skelton Williams asked Congress to augment the pow-

ers of national banks to offer insurance.  In his view, national 
banks located in "country towns and villages" were in need of 
additional sources of revenue and should be allowed to more 
fully compete with state chartered banks.  Citing s 24 (Sev-
enth), the Comptroller noted a hurdle to his goal:  "National 
banks are not given either expressly nor by necessary impli-
cation the power to act as agents for insurance compa-
nies...."  To resolve this situation, the Comptroller asked 
Congress to grant insurance agency power to national banks, 
but only those located in small towns.  In his view, "it would 
be unwise and therefore undesirable to confer this privilege 
generally upon banks in large cities where the legitimate 
business of banking affords ample scope for the energies of 
trained and expert bankers."  53 Cong. Rec. 11,001 (1916).

     Congress acted on the Comptroller's request.  It passed an 
amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 
ch. 461, 39 Stat. 752 (codified at 12 U.S.C. s 92 (1994)), which 
provides:

     In addition to the powers now vested by law in the 
     national banking associations organized under the law of 
     the United States any such association located and doing 
     business in any place the population of which does not 
     exceed five thousand inhabitants ... may, under such 
     rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Comp-
     troller of the Currency, act as the agent for any fire, life, 
     or other insurance company authorized by the authorities 
     of the State in which said bank is located to do business 
     in said State, by soliciting and selling insurance and 
     collecting premiums on policies issued by such compa-
     ny....
     
12 U.S.C. s 92.  Briefly put, this statute authorizes only 
those national banks located in towns of 5,000 or less to sell 
insurance as an agent.

     In light of this statutory framework, both the Fifth and 
Second Circuits have rejected attempts by the Comptroller to 
authorize all national banks to sell insurance, purportedly 
under the authority of the incidental powers clause of s 24 
(Seventh).  See Saxon v. Georgia Ass'n of Indep. Ins. Agents, 

Inc., 399 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1968);  American Land Title 
Ass'n v. Clarke, 968 F.2d 150 (2d Cir. 1992) ("ALTA").1

     In Saxon, the Comptroller decided, without further con-
gressional authorization, that " '[i]ncidental to the powers 
vested in them under 12 U.S.C. Section[ ] 24 ..., National 
Banks have the authority to act as agent in the issuance of 
insurance which is incident to banking transactions.' "  Sax-
on, 399 F.2d at 1012 (quoting O.C.C. Ruling No. 7110).  The 
ruling was not limited to locales of less than 5,000 persons.  A 
group of insurance agents brought a declaratory judgment 
action asking the court to hold the Comptroller's ruling 
unlawful.  On appellate review, the Fifth Circuit held that 
s 24 (Seventh) could not confer general insurance powers 
when considered in conjunction with the implications of s 92.  
See id. at 1013-16.  Judge Thornberry's concurrence shed 
light on the basic dilemma:  "From an economic standpoint, it 
may be unfortunate that this Court is interfering with the 
expansion of national banks ..., but the banks should look to 
Congress, not the Comptroller."  Id. at 1021 (Thornberry, J., 
concurring specially).

     The scenario was similar in the Second Circuit ALTA case.  
There, the OCC issued an interpretative letter in 1986 allow-
ing any national bank to act as agent in the general sale of 
title insurance.  See ALTA, 968 F.2d at 151.  Relying on this 
interpretation, the Comptroller authorized a national bank to 
sell title insurance as agent to borrowers and lenders in 
connection with real estate loans made by the bank.  The 
Comptroller attempted to distinguish Saxon on the grounds 
that title insurance, unlike the broader range of activities 

__________
     1 Two other circuits have embraced the same reading of national 
banking statutes as Saxon and ALTA without discussion.  See 
Commissioner v. Morris Trust, 367 F.2d 794, 795 (4th Cir. 1966) 
("[A] national bank is prohibited from operating an insurance 
department except in towns having a population of not more than 
5000 inhabitants.");  First Sec. Bank of Utah, N.A. v. Commission-
er, 436 F.2d 1192, 1195-96 (10th Cir. 1971) (citing Saxon and 
Morris Trust), aff'd, 405 U.S. 394 (1972).  The Supreme Court has 
recognized this case law, but has had no occasion to pass on the 
issue.  See VALIC, 513 U.S. at 260-61;  Commissioner v. First Sec. 
Bank of Utah, N.A., 405 U.S. 394, 401-02 (1972).

authorized in Saxon, was essential to a bank's ability to 
provide financing.  The Second Circuit rejected this interpre-
tation, noting that the Saxon court did not look to the nature 
of the insurance activity authorized.  See id. at 155-57.  
Rather, the ALTA court recognized that s 92 applies to "any 
... insurance company," and that "a title insurance company 
is surely an insurance company."  Id. at 156 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted).  The court held that even if s 24 
(Seventh) could be read to encompass the general sale of title 
insurance, s 92 precluded such a reading.

                    B. The Present Controversy

     The facts of this case are a rerun of those in Saxon and 
ALTA.  Though the OCC is surely familiar with its past 
defeats, it seems determined to repeat them.

     On December 29, 1997, the OCC issued a letter ruling that 
"a national bank may offer, as agent, multiple peril crop 
insurance and hail/fire insurance (collectively, 'crop insur-
ance')...." (footnotes omitted).  The product insures against 
"unavoidable losses on crops, including losses due to drought, 
excess moisture, insects, disease, flood, hail, wind and frost."  
If a farmer's average yield drops below the insured level, the 
insurance company pays the difference directly to the farmer.

     The Comptroller ruled that the sale of crop insurance was 
within the "business of banking" for three reasons:  (1) crop 
insurance is similar to credit-related insurance which banks 
may offer and is a "logical outgrowth" of the bank's power to 
make loans because it assists banks in making recovery from 
borrowers;  (2) crop insurance is something that benefits 
farmers and banks by protecting against risks;  and (3) the 
risks are similar to those already borne by national banks in 
the sale of insurance authorized under 12 U.S.C. s 92 or 
elsewhere.  The Comptroller further concluded that even if 
the sale of crop insurance was not part of the business of 
banking, it was "incidental" to that business.  In a footnote, 
the agency stated that the prior circuit decisions in Saxon 
and ALTA were not applicable because those decisions were 
only concerned with "broad forms" of insurance.

     The district court rejected the Comptroller's interpretation.  
Citing Saxon and ALTA approvingly, and relying on the 
interpretative cannons of giving each provision of a statute 
meaning and expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the court 
reasoned that s 92 was "intended to remedy what Congress 
saw to be the limited powers of section 24 (Seventh)" and 
thus compelled the conclusion that all national banks did not 
have general insurance powers.  IIAA, 43 F. Supp. 2d at 24.  
The court rejected the suggestion that "crop insurance" is 
actually a credit-related product, like the credit-life insurance 
approved in Heimann.  See id. at 25-26.  Unlike the product 
in Heimann, payable to the bank, crop insurance protects 
farmers and does not guarantee repayment to lenders like a 
traditional security device.

                           II. Analysis

     When interpreting the meaning of a federal statute admin-
istered by a single agency, we engage in the two-step inquiry 
of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).  
At the first step, we inquire into whether Congress has 
directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If it has, we 
must give effect to that express intent.  When performing 
this first step, we employ traditional tools of statutory con-
struction.  See id. at 843 n.9;  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 
U.S. 421, 446 (1987).  If the statute before us is silent or 
ambiguous on the precise issue, we proceed to the second 
step, where we will defer to the agency's interpretation of the 
statute if it is reasonable and consistent with the statute's 
purpose.  See, e.g., Nuclear Info. Resource Serv. v. Nuclear 
Regulatory Comm'n, 969 F.2d 1169, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en 
banc).2

__________
     2 In Christensen v. Harris County, ___ S. Ct. ____, 2000 WL 
504578 (U.S. May 1, 2000), decided after oral argument in this case, 
the Supreme Court held that agency interpretations voiced in 
opinion letters "do not warrant Chevron-style deference."  Id. at *6.  
Instead, they are "entitled to respect" under Skidmore v. Swift & 
Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), "but only to the extent that those 
interpretations have the 'power to persuade.' "  Christensen at *6 
(quoting Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 256-58 (1991)).  

     In this case, our inquiry is whether the "all such incidental 
powers" language of s 24 (Seventh) includes the power of 
banks to sell crop insurance.  While the word "incidental" 
may be a poster child for ambiguity, we find that it is not 
ambiguous in the context of general insurance activities.  A 
broad statute when passed "may have a range of plausible 
meanings," but subsequent acts can narrow those meanings 
"where the scope of the earlier statute is broad but the 
subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at 
hand." FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 120 
S. Ct. 1291, 1306 (2000);  see also G.A. Endlich, A Commen-
tary on the Interpretation of Statutes s 399 (1888) ("[T]he 
special mention of one thing indicates that it was not intended 
to be covered by a general provision which would otherwise 
include it.").  Just so here.  Because s 92 expressly grants 
national banks located in small towns the general power to 
sell insurance as agent, reading s 24 (Seventh) to authorize 
the sale of insurance by all national banks transgresses both 
common sense and two traditional rules of statutory interpre-
tation:  the presumption against surplusage and expressio 
unius est exclusio alterius.

     A broad reading of s 24 (Seventh) to allow the general sale 
of insurance by national banks would render at least two 
other related statutes meaningless, in violation of the "end-
lessly reiterated principle of statutory construction ...  that 
all words in a statute are to be assigned meaning, and that 
nothing therein is to be construed as surplusage."  Qi-Zhuo 
v. Meissner, 70 F.3d 136, 139 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  see also 
Halverson v. Slater, 129 F.3d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1997) 
("Congress cannot be presumed to do a futile thing.").  Why 
would Congress have passed s 92 to confer insurance authori-

__________
All parties in this case assumed that the normal Chevron framework 
applied to the Comptroller's interpretation of s 24 (Seventh) con-
tained in a letter.  See Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc. v. 
Ludwig, 997 F.2d 958 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (applying Chevron step two 
to a Comptroller letter).  We frame part of our analysis in terms of 
whether the Comptroller's decision is "reasonable," infra at 12-13, 
and our conclusions are equally applicable under the less-deferential 
standard of Skidmore as under Chevron step two.

ty to some national banks if all national banks already had 
that power pursuant to s 24 (Seventh)?  It would have been 
completely useless.  See ALTA, 968 F.2d at 155.  Likewise, 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act authorizes financial subsidiaries 
established by "well capitalized and well managed" national 
banks to "[i]nsur[e] ... against loss, harm, damage, illness, 
disability, or death" as agent or broker.  Pub. L. No. 106-102, 
ss 103(a) (listing activities that financial holding companies 
may engage in), 121 (authorizing financial subsidiaries of 
national banks to engage in some of these activities), 113 Stat. 
1338, 1343, 1373-74.  If national banks could already sell 
insurance under s 24 (Seventh), Congress would have no 
reason to pass a statute limiting that power to financial 
subsidiaries of only "well capitalized and well managed" na-
tional banks.

     In addition to the canon of avoiding surplusage, expressio 
unius est exclusio alterius also points to the conclusion that 
Congress did not intend for all national banks to have insur-
ance powers under s 24 (Seventh).  See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 
51 F.3d 1053, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("mention of one thing 
implies the exclusion of another thing") (quoting American 
Methyl Corp. v. EPA, 749 F.2d 827, 835-36 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  
In context, because s 92 only confers the authority to sell 
insurance on banks in smaller locales, and because national 
banks only have the powers granted to them by statute, s 92 
strongly confirms the view that the more general grant in 
s 24 (Seventh) did not include broad insurance powers.  See 
ALTA, 968 F.2d at 155-56;  Saxon, 399 F.2d at 1013-14.

     The Comptroller argues that the expressio unius maxim 
cannot preclude an otherwise reasonable agency interpreta-
tion.  This is not entirely correct.  True, we have rejected the 
canon in some administrative law cases, but only where the 
logic of the maxim-that the special mention of one thing 
indicates an intent for another thing not be included else-
where-simply did not hold up in the statutory context.  See 
Texas Rural Legal Aid, Inc. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 940 F.2d 
685, 694 (D.C. Cir. 1991);  Clinchfield Coal Co. v. FMSHRC, 
895 F.2d 773, 779 (D.C. Cir. 1990);  Cheney R.R. Co. v. ICC, 
902 F.2d 66, 68-69 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  As we have noted, if 

there are other reasonable explanations for an omission in a 
statute, expressio unius may not be a useful tool.  See 
Clinchfield, 895 F.2d at 779;  see also Carter v. Director, 
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 751 F.2d 1398, 
1401-02 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  But, where the context shows that 
the "draftsmen's mention of one thing, like a grant of authori-
ty, does really necessarily, or at least reasonably, imply the 
preclusion of alternatives," the canon is a useful aid.  Shook v. 
District of Columbia Finan. Responsibility and Management 
Assistance Auth., 132 F.3d 775, 782 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  see also 
Halverson, 129 F.3d at 185-87;  Michigan Citizens for an 
Indep. Press v. Thornburgh, 868 F.2d 1285, 1292-93 (D.C. 
Cir.), aff'd by an equally divided court, 493 U.S. 38 (1989).

     In this case, the two canons upon which we rely inarguably 
compel our holding that s 24 (Seventh) unambiguously does 
not authorize national banks to engage in the general sale of 
insurance as "incidental" to "the business of banking."  The 
Supreme Court employed reasoning identical to ours in Texas 
& Pacific Railway Co. v. Pottorff, 291 U.S. 245 (1934).  
There, the Court considered whether a national bank has the 
incidental power under s 24 (Seventh) to pledge its assets to 
secure a private deposit.  The Court found no evidence that 
such a pledge was in any way incidental to banking, and 
furthermore reasoned that if this power was authorized, there 
would have been no need to later alter 12 U.S.C. s 1290 to 
provide a limited power to pledge.  See id. at 257-59.  The 
pre-Chevron vintage of Pottorff is irrelevant;  the High Court 
had already made clear by that time that interpretations of 
the Comptroller merit deference.  See First Nat'l Bank in St. 
Louis v. Missouri, 263 U.S. 640, 658-59 (1924).

     Even in light of the inherent ambiguity of the "incidental" 
phrase of s 24 (Seventh), we nonetheless do not find that the 
statute is ambiguous here within the meaning of Chevron.  
To the contrary, the instant case and Pottorff both suggest 
that the cannons of avoiding surplusage and expressio unius 
are at their zenith when they apply in tandem.  Cf. Halver-
son, 129 F.3d at 184-86;  Endlich, supra, at s 399.  Under 
the first step of Chevron, we hold that Congress has not 

authorized the Comptroller to permit the sale of crop insur-
ance solely under the authority of s 24 (Seventh).

     To the extent any ambiguity remains on the issue, we 
conclude that the Comptroller's interpretation of s 24 (Sev-
enth) is not reasonable.  Crop insurance is a general form of 
property or casualty insurance protecting farmers against 
many potential disasters.  It falls squarely within the types of 
insurance held unauthorized in Saxon and ALTA.  Unlike the 
special credit-life product which we approved in Heimann, 
the beneficiary of crop insurance is the farmer-insured, not 
the bank.  If the sale of crop insurance is "incidental" to 
banking under s 24 (Seventh), there would no way of distin-
guishing other general forms of insurance.  Agriculturalists 
undoubtedly rely on banks to obtain loans, but so do other 
individual and corporate borrowers who may also wish to 
purchase property or casualty insurance to protect their 
interests.  Nothing about "crop insurance" leads to a conclu-
sion that it can be treated differently than other general 
forms of insurance under national banking laws just because 
its coverage is limited to farmers.

     The OCC supports its interpretation on the grounds that 
the sale of crop insurance involves risks similar to those 
already assumed by banks, would benefit customers, and 
would be a "logical outgrowth" of current bank activities.  
The Comptroller cites as support, for example, the experience 
of national banks in small locales in selling all types of 
insurance under 12 U.S.C. s 92.  However, that activity is 
statutorily authorized.  While the sale of crop insurance may 
be a "logical outgrowth" that national banks could apply their 
prior experience to, that alone cannot constitute legal authori-
zation.  If it did, national banks would be able to constantly 
expand their field of operations on an incremental basis 
without congressional action.  First would be the authority to 
sell crop insurance, followed by whatever insurance against 
business risks of a bank customer is the next "logical out-
growth."  There would be no logical stopping point.  Section 
24 (Seventh) cannot bear the weight the Comptroller propos-
es to place on it under its test.  The Comptroller may of 
course authorize activities under s 24 (Seventh) "within rea-

sonable bounds," but today's interpretation is not within such 
bounds.  VALIC, 513 U.S. at 258 n.2.

                         III. Conclusion3

     In the end, this case may have little practical effect.  
National banks have the power to sell insurance, including 
crop insurance, if they meet the requirements of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act.  However, they do not have the power to 
sell crop insurance solely under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 
s 24 (Seventh).  The judgment of the district court is

                                                                  Affirmed.
