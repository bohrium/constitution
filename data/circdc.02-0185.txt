     Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge Sentelle.

     Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  John D. 
Barnes (Barnes) appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. 
s 922(g)(9), which makes it unlawful for a person convicted of 
a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" to possess fire-
arms or ammunition.  Barnes challenges whether his 1998 
assault conviction under D.C. Code s 22-504(a) constitutes a 
"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as defined in 18 
U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(A) because section 22-504(a) does not 
include as an express element of the offense any relationship 
between the offender and the victim.  Our sister circuits that 
have addressed this question have rejected Barnes's reading 
of section 921(a)(33)(A).  It is an issue of first impression for 
us.  Barnes also raises several constitutional challenges to his 
firearms conviction.  While section 921(a)(33)(A) is not a 
paradigm of precise draftsmanship, we nonetheless join the 
other circuits in concluding that section 921(a)(33)(A) does not 
require the predicate "misdemeanor crime of domestic vio-
lence" to contain as an express element a relationship be-
tween the offender and his victim.

     On August 5, 1997 Barnes was charged in D.C. Superior 
Court with assault under D.C. Code s 22-504(a).1  The 
charging information alleged that on or about July 21, 1997 
Barnes unlawfully assaulted Keisha Ellis, who, Barnes ulti-
mately acknowledged, is his son's mother.  See Charging 

__________
     1 Section 22-504(a) of the D.C. Code, now codified at s 22-404(a) 
(2001), stated:  "Whoever unlawfully assaults, or threatens another 
in a menacing manner, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or be 
imprisoned not more than 180 days, or both."  The recodification 
did not change the language.

in No. M-11747-97 at 16.  After pleading guilty to the 
charge, Barnes was sentenced to a prison term of 180 days, 
execution of which was suspended on the condition of a one-
year period of probation.  The judgment and commit-
ment/probation order required Barnes to observe standard 
conditions of probation and, in particular, to enroll in and 
complete the local court's domestic violence intervention pro-
gram.  See May 5, 1998 Judgment and Commitment Order at 
1.

     On August 17, 2000 an officer of the Metropolitan Police 
Department observed a vehicle being driven by Barnes.  A 
paper trash bag obscured the right rear vent window.  See 
8/22/00 Tr. at 6.  Believing that the car was stolen, the officer 
made a traffic stop and ran a search on Barnes's driver's 
license.  The search revealed that he did not have a valid 
license.  Upon placing Barnes under arrest for driving with-
out a permit, the police officer conducted a search and 
discovered that Barnes had two .45 caliber bullets in his left 
pocket.  See 8/22/00 Tr. 6-7.  Another officer, who arrived at 
the scene before Barnes's arrest, searched the car and found 
a loaded and operable Sig Sauer .45 caliber pistol underneath 
the driver's seat.  After a records check revealed that Barnes 
had been convicted of assault under D.C. Code s 22-504(a), 
see D.C. Superior Court Case No. M-11747-97, Barnes was 
charged with the unlawful and knowing receipt and posses-
sion of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
s 922(g)(9).  See Information in Cr. No. 00-295.  On October 
6, 2001 pursuant to a plea agreement, Barnes entered a 
conditional guilty plea to the one-count criminal information.  
In accordance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), his plea agree-
ment explicitly reserved his right to challenge whether his 
May 5, 1998 assault conviction constituted a "misdemeanor 
crime of domestic violence" as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
s 921(a)(33)(A).  Plea Agreement in United States v. Barnes, 
Cr. No. 00-0295 at 2.

     On February 1, 2001 Barnes filed a brief in district court, 
raising the statutory claim explicitly reserved in his plea 
agreement, see February 1, 2001 Defendant's Memorandum 

of Law (App. 20-58), along with an unopposed motion to 
supplement that claim with several constitutional arguments.  
See February 1, 2001 Defendant's Unopposed Motion to 
Supplement (App. 16-19).  Barnes maintained that his assault 
conviction under D.C. Code s 22-504(a), which "does not 
include the relational element set forth in 18 U.S.C. 
s 921(a)(33)(A)," does not qualify as a "misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence" under section 922(g)(9).  February 1, 2001 
Defendant's Memorandum of Law at 3-6 (App. 22-25).  He 
also claimed that his conviction violated "principles of equal 
protection contained in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth 
Amendment" and that section 922(g)(9), read in conjunction 
with 18 U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(A), was "unconstitutionally 
vague."  Id. at 6-7.  The government opposed Barnes's 
claims.  See February 27, 2001 Government Memorandum of 
Law (App. 59-66).

     On March 19, 2001 the district court held that Barnes's 
"conviction in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia 
in Criminal Case No. M-11747-97 for simple assault under 
D.C. Code s 22-504 constitutes a 'misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 
s 921(a)(33)(A) and can thus serve as a predicate for convic-
tion under 18 U.S.C. s 922(g)(9)."  March 19, 2001 Order at 1 
(App. 76).  Regarding the statutory question, the district 
court adopted the reasoning of the First and Eighth Circuits, 
stating that "[h]ad Congress intended to require the prosecu-
tion to prove as elements of the offense both the use of force 
and the relationship of the defendant to the victim, it surely 
could have done so by using the plural, 'elements,' rather than 
the singular, 'element,' when writing s 921(a)(33)'s definition 
of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."  See March 19, 
2001 Memorandum Opinion at 4 (citing United States v. 
Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 218-20 (1st Cir. 1999), and United 
States v. Smith, 171 F.3d 617, 619-20 (8th 1999)).  The 
district court also rejected Barnes's constitutional challenges.  
See March 19, 2001 Memorandum Opinion at 7-11.  On April 
17, 2001 the district court sentenced Barnes to a term of 
imprisonment of twelve months and one day, followed by two 
years' supervised release as well as a special assessment of 

$100.  4/17/01 Tr. 7.  Barnes filed a timely notice of appeal 
and the district court stayed execution of the sentence pend-
ing appeal.

     Because the district court's ruling involved solely questions 
of law, our review is de novo.  See Butler v. West, 164 F.3d 
634, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted);  United States v. 
Popa, 187 F.3d 672, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted)

A.   Elements of "Misdemeanor Crime of Domestic Violence"

     In 1996, the Congress amended the Gun Control Act of 
1968, 18 U.S.C. s 922 (1994), by providing that:

     It shall be unlawful for any person ... who has been 
     convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domes-
     tic violence, ... to ship or transport in interstate or 
     foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, 
     any firearm or ammunition;  or to receive any firearm or 
     ammunition which has been shipped or transported in 
     interstate commerce.
     
18 U.S.C. s 922(g)(9).  Section 921 of Title 18, entitled "Defi-
nitions," provides in pertinent part:

     the term "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" 
     means an offense that--
     
     (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law;  and
     
     (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of 
     physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, 
     committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or 
     guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim 
     shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitat-
     ing with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, 
     parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a 
     spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim
     
18 U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(A).2

     Barnes asserts that the definition of "misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence" set forth in section 921(a)(33)(A) requires 
the predicate offense to "contain, 'as an element,' not only the 
'use or attempted use of physical force ...' but also that the 
use of force be 'committed by' a person who maintained a 
domestic relationship with the victim, as specifically defined 
in the statute."  See Barnes's Br. at 7-8.  The government 
responds that "the text and legislative purpose" demonstrate 
that section 921(a)(33)(A) "does not require that the neces-
sary domestic relationship be established as an element of the 
predicate offense."  Gov't Br. at 12-13.

     In construing a statute, we look first for the plain meaning 
of the text.  If the language of the statute has a "plain and 
unambiguous meaning," our inquiry ends so long as the 
resulting "statutory scheme is coherent and consistent."  See 
United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347, 352 (D.C. Cir. 2002) 
(quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) 
(internal quotations omitted)).  Whether statutory language 
is plain depends on "the language itself, the specific context in 
which that language is used, and the broader context of the 
statute as a whole."  Id. (quoting Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341).

     Both sides agree that D.C. Code s 22-504(a) constitutes a 
"misdemeanor under ... State Law" within the meaning of 
section 921(a)(33)(A)(i).  Barnes and the government also 
agree that section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires that a "misde-
meanor crime of domestic violence" contain "as an element" 
"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened 
use of a deadly weapon."  18 U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  
Moreover, there is no dispute that section 22-504(a) of the 
D.C. Code contains a similar element.3  It also appears 

__________
     2 Section 924(a)(2) of Title 18 provides that "[w]hoever knowingly 
violates ... [922(g)(9)] shall be fined as provided in this title, 
imprisoned not more than 10 years or both."  See 18 U.S.C. 
s 924(a)(2).

     3 Assault under D.C. Code s 22-504(a) consists of:  "(1) an act on 
the part of the accused (which need not result in injury);  (2) the 
apparent present ability to injure the victim at the time the act is 

undisputed that Barnes and the victim of his assault, Keisha 
Ellis, had a son together at the time of the assault and thus 
share one of the domestic relationships included in section 
921(a)(33)(A)(ii) ("committed ... by a person with whom the 
victim shares a child in common").  See February 1, 2001 
Defendant's Memorandum of Law at 2 ("Mr. Barnes shares a 
child in common with the complaintant [sic] in M-11747-97") 
(App. 21);  February 1, 2001 Defendant's Memorandum of 
Law Exh. 3 at 16 (App. 45) and 22 (App. 51).  Barnes 
contends, however, that the applicable relationship is an 
express element of the predicate offense because the prohibit-
ed "use of force" must be "committed" by a person with that 
relationship.  Having been convicted of assault under D.C. 
Code s 22-504(a), which does not require a relationship be-
tween offender and victim, Barnes argues that his subsequent 
possession of a firearm is not prohibited by section 922(g)(9) 
because he has not been convicted of a "misdemeanor crime 
of domestic violence."  While the domestic relationship re-
quirement of section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) must unquestionably be 
established in a section 922(g)(9) prosecution, the dispute here 
is whether the predicate offense must itself expressly include 
the requirement.

     The premise of Barnes's reading of section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) 
is that the "committed by" language modifies the "use of 
force" clause immediately preceding it and thus is included in 
the "element" that a "misdemeanor crime of domestic vio-
lence" must contain.  Barnes refers to what is known as the 
"Rule of the Last Antecedent," whereby "[o]rdinarily, qualify-
ing phrases are to be applied to the words or phrase immedi-
ately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to 
others more remote."  United States v. Pritchett, 470 F.2d 
455, 459 & n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1972).  Accordingly, Barnes argues 
that the "committed by" phrase modifies the "use of force" 
element because the latter immediately precedes the former

committed;  and (3) the intent to perform the act which constitutes 
the assault at the time the act is committed."  Ruffin v. United 
States, 642 A.2d 1288, 1295 (D.C. 1994) (citing Criminal Jury 
Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 4.07 (4th ed. 1993)).

within subpart (ii).  As was noted in Pritchett, however, "the 
Rule of Last Antecedent is not an inflexible rule, and is not 
applied where the context indicates otherwise."  Id. at 459.  
Here, context is everything.  Bearing in mind that, "when 
construing a statute, we are obliged to give effect, if possible, 
to every word Congress used," Murphy Exploration & Prod. 
Co. v. U.S. Dept. of Interior, 252 F.3d 473, 481 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 
(1979));  see also Alabama Power Co. v. EPA, 40 F.3d 450, 
455 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("[s]tatutory text is to be interpreted to 
give consistent and harmonious effect to each of its provi-
sions"), we must determine if "committed by" can, consistent 
with its meaning, modify "use of force."  The verb "commit" 
means "to do (something wrong or reprehensible), to perpe-
trate, be guilty of (a crime or offence, etc.)."  Oxford English 
Dictionary 559 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added).  The use of 
force is not "committed," "done" or "perpetrated."4  An "of-
fense" is "committed" or "perpetrated."  And here, the of-
fense of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" must be 
committed by a person in one of the specific relationships.  
Subpart (ii) of section 921(a)(33)(A) is not a complete sen-
tence--subsection 921(a)(33)(A) is itself one sentence that 
begins with "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in subparagraph 
(C), the term 'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means 
an offense that--" and continues through subparts (i) and 
(ii).5  In short, a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" 
means an offense that is a misdemeanor, has, as an element, 
the use of force and was committed by a person with the 
requisite relationship.  An illustration using simpler language 
demonstrates the point.  If the statute read

     "larceny means an offense that has, as an element, 
     monetary gain, committed by a person ...,"
     
it would be obvious that "committed" modifies "offense" and 
that monetary gain is the only "element."  Just as "monetary 

__________
     4 While "commit" can also mean "obligate" or "pledge" as in "the 
President committed to the use of force," that meaning is plainly 
inapplicable.  Oxford English Dictionary 560.

     5 Interestingly, the sentence has no punctuation mark at the end.

gain" is not "committed," the "use of force" is not "commit-
ted."  The "offense" is "committed."6

     Barnes argues that if the Congress had intended the 
predicate offense to include only the "use of force" as an 
express element, it would have inserted the words "and was" 
before "committed by" and placed the remainder of (ii) in a 
subpart numbered (iii).  Barnes Br. at 11.  Needless to say, if 
the Congress had more precisely articulated its intention, our 
task would have been easier.  In interpreting a statute, 
however, we are to determine its true, natural meaning, 
where ascertainable, irrespective of cumbersome syntax.  See 
United States v. Moore, 613 F.2d 1029, 1040 (D.C. Cir. 1979) 
("or" read as conjunctive because "strict grammatical con-
struction will frustrate legislative intent" evinced by legisla-
tive history and statutory purpose);  United States Nat'l 
Bank of Oregon v. Indep. Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 
U.S. 439, 454-55 (1993) (purported "plain-meaning" analysis 
based only on punctuation inadequate where "deployment of 
quotation marks" points in one direction and "all of the other 
evidence from the statute points the other way");  cf. United 
States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 82-83 
(1932) ("To determine the intent of the law, the court, in 
construing a statute will disregard the punctuation, or will 
repunctuate, if that be necessary, in order to arrive at the 

__________
     6 In section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the word "committed" is a past 
participle used adjectivally to modify the noun "offense."  "[O]f-
fense" is a predicate nominative referring to the subject of the 
sentence "the term 'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.' " 
"[U]se of force" is the direct object of the verb "has," which here 
means "includes" or "contains."  Merriam-Webster's Third New 
International Dictionary 1039 (1993).  The phrase "as an element" 
adjectivally modifies "use of force."  See generally Martha Kolln, 
Understanding English Grammar 21-53 ("Sentence Patterns") (4th 
Ed. 1994).  Indeed, the entire "committed by" phrase can be 
construed to modify the language that begins with "offense."  
Again, a simpler sentence will demonstrate:  "Act 284 is a law that 
deals with robbery, enacted by the legislature in 1975."  In this 
sentence, "enacted by the legislature in 1975" can modify both "a 
law" as well as "a law that deals with robbery."

natural meaning of the words employed.").  In a Ninth 
Circuit decision, Longview Fibre Co. v. Rasmussen, 980 F.2d 
1307 (9th Cir. 1992), the court analyzed the following lan-
guage of the Clean Water Act:  "in approving or promulgating 
any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 
1312, 1316, or 1345 of this title."  Id. at 1310 (quoting 33 
U.S.C. s 1369(b)(1)(E)).  The critical question, the court de-
clared, was "[d]oes the modifier reach back?"  In other 
words, do the listed sections modify "other limitation" only or 
"any effluent limitation" as well?  It first noted that "[g]ram-
matically, either interpretation could be correct, and the 
[first] interpretation would more likely be right.  'Subor-
dinate clauses should be placed near the words they modify.'  
Margaret Shertzer, The Elements of Grammar 47 (1986).  
That is why we say, 'As I was flying into Ketchikan, I saw a 
pod of whales,' not 'I saw a pod of whales flying into Ketchi-
kan.' "  Id. at 1310-11.  In concluding that the modifier does 
indeed reach back, the court stated:

     Syntax cannot always control construction.  The legisla-
     tive process may have subordinated clear writing to some 
     other goal.  We must examine the meaning of the words 
     to see whether one construction makes more sense than 
     the other as a means of attributing a rational purpose to 
     Congress.  Read for rational purpose, the syntactically 
     disfavored construction of section 1369(b)(1)(E) is sensi-
     ble, the other as unlikely as the flying whales.
     
Id. at 1311.  The fact that the Congress somewhat awkwardly 
included the "committed by" phrase in subpart (ii) (instead of 
adding a subpart (iii)) is not significant in view of the unnatu-
ral reading that would result if "committed by" were con-
strued to modify "use of force."7

tion of section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) that was not advanced by the

     7 In fact, if the Rule of Last Antecedent were literally applied,

government, namely that "committed" modifies "offense."  
See Dissent op. at 3-4.  But the meaning of the statute is "the 
issue ... properly before the court," Kamen v. Kemper Fin. 
Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 99 (1991),8 and thus "the court ..., 
retains the independent power to identify and apply the 
proper construction of governing law."  Id. (emphasis added).  
Alluding briefly to the merits, the dissent rejects what it 
refers to as "the majority's ipse dixit."  Dissent op. at 4.  
"Ipse dixit" means a "bare assertion resting on the authority 
of an individual."  Black's Law Dictionary 961 (4th ed. 1968).  
The "individuals" on whose authority the majority rests for 
the meaning of "committed" are the Oxford English Dictio-
nary and Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dic-
tionary.  See supra at 8.  Our dissenting colleague declares 
that it "cannot be gainsaid that the language of this statute is 
ambiguous," adding that the majority opinion is "rife with 
allusions to its ambiguity."  Dissent op. at 2.  The dissent has 
not read the majority opinion carefully.  As the foregoing 
discussion manifests, we refer to imprecision (not "ambigui-
ty") only in connection with the syntax of the statute, not 
with the meaning of the language used.

     That the district court as well as every other court that has 
considered the issue concluded, albeit on a different basis, 
that section 921(a)(33)(A)'s language plainly requires only one 
element, i.e., the use of force, further bolsters our interpreta-
tion.  See March 19, 2001 Memorandum Opinion at 4;  United

Mass. 1997);  United States v. Smith, 964 F. Supp. 286, 291-
92 (N.D. Iowa);  see also United States v. Ball, 7 Fed. Appx. 
210, 213 (4th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 226 (2001) 
(unpublished per curiam order).  These courts found the 
Congress's use of the singular "element" rather than "ele-
ments" determinative.  As the district court in Meade stated:

     The crux of the matter is whether the phrase "as an 
     element" modifies both requirements or just the use of 
     force requirement.  The inclusion of both the use of force 
     and domestic relationship requirements in one sentence 
     does not mandate that they be treated as one element.  
     In drafting the statute Congress placed the singular 
     word "element" immediately before the use of force 
     requirement.  In choosing the singular word "element," 
     Congress intended to modify only the language immedi-
     ately following the phrase.  If Congress had intended 
     that both requirements be mandatory elements of the 
     underlying state statute the word "element" would have 
     been in the plural to encompass both requirements.  
     Reading the phrase "has, as an element" in its ordinary 
     plain meaning, it is clear the singular "element" modifies 
     only the use of force requirement.
     
Meade, 986 F. Supp. at 68.  Barnes counters that if, as he 
contends, the "committed by" language modifies the use of 
force clause, "Congress could have reasonably viewed the two 
factual requirements as a single element."  Barnes Br. at 12.  
Under this view, the use of the singular element is not 
determinative because a qualifying "misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence" simply has one element with two subparts.  
To be sure, the Congress has used the singular "element" 
when referring to more than one factor in other provisions of 
Title 18.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. s 16(a) (defining "crime of 
violence" as "an offense that has as an element the use, 

attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the 
person or property of another"(emphasis added)).  Nonethe-
less, while a "crime of violence" may have a necessarily two-
pronged single "element," namely (1) use of force (2) against 
another's person or property, the singular "element" used in 
section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is followed by two independent, and 
unlinked, factors, the use of force and the perpetrator's 
relationship to the victim.9  Our research has revealed that 
section 921(a)(33)(A) of Title 18 appears to be the only federal 
criminal statute in which the "has, as an element," language is 
set off by commas.  In addition, that the "committed by" 
language is itself separated from the "use of force" language 
by a comma (as well as by the clause "or the threatened use 
of a deadly weapon") reinforces the separateness of the "use 
of force" element from the "committed by" language.  In 
defining crimes that have more than one distinct element, the 
Congress generally uses the phrase "has as its elements"  
(emphasis added).  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. s 3559(2)(A) ("the 
term 'assault with intent to commit rape' means an offense 
that has as its elements engaging in physical contact with 
another person or using or brandishing a weapon against 
another person with intent to commit aggravated sexual 
abuse or sexual abuse").10 While we do not necessarily find 
the singular versus plural rationale determinative, it does 

__________
     9 While the "has as an element" language appears throughout 
Title 18, it is generally used in reference to a "crime of violence" 
and is defined as in 18 U.S.C. s 16(a).  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ss 373, 
924(c)(3)(A), 924(e)(2)(B)(i).

     10 See also 18 U.S.C. s 3559(2)(B) ("the term 'arson' means an 
offense that has as its elements maliciously damaging or destroying 
any building, inhabited structure, vehicle, vessel, or real property 
by means of fire or an explosive");  18 U.S.C. s 3559(2)(C) ("the 
term 'extortion' means an offense that has as its elements the 
extraction of anything of value from another person by threatening 
or placing that person in fear of injury to any person or kidnapping 
of any person");  18 U.S.C. s 3559(2)(D) ("the term 'firearms use' 
means an offense that has as its elements those described in section 
924(c) or 929(a), if the firearm was brandished, discharged, or 
otherwise used as a weapon and the crime of violence or drug 

support our interpretation of section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as re-
quiring that a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" 
include only the use of force as an element.

     We are also influenced by the fact that Barnes's interpreta-
tion of section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) would create a "significant 
practical anomaly," rendering the law a nullity in a majority 
of the states as well as at the Federal level.  Meade, 175 F.3d 
at 220.  A "statute should ordinarily be read to effectuate its 
purposes rather than frustrate them."  See, e.g., Motor Vehi-
cle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. Ruckelshaus, 719 F.2d 1159, 
1165 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (citations omitted).11  Section 922(g)(9) 
of Title 18, known as the "Lautenberg Amendment," 142 
Cong. Rec. D927-02, *D928 (1996), was enacted in order to 
remedy the nationwide problem that those convicted of a 
felony involving domestic assault were prohibited from fire-
arms possession while those convicted of a misdemeanor 
involving domestic assault were not.  In explaining the law's 
disparate treatment of a person convicted of a domestic 
assault misdemeanor, Senator Lautenberg stated:

__________
trafficking crime during and relation to which the firearm was used 
was subject to prosecution in a court of the United States or a court 
of a State, or both");  18 U.S.C. s 3559(2)(E) ("the term 'kidnapping' 
means an offense that has as its elements the abduction, restrain-
ing, confining, or carrying away of another person by force or 
threat of force");  see also 42 U.S.C. s 14071(a)(3)(B) ("The term 
'sexually violent offense' means ... an offense that has as its 
elements engaging in physical contact with another person with 
intent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse.").

     11 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms takes the posi-
tion that "a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" includes "all 
misdemeanors that involve the use or attempted use of physical 
force (e.g., simple assault, assault and battery) if the offense is 
committed by one of the defined parties.  This is true whether or 
not the State statute or local ordinance specifically defines the 
offense as a domestic violence misdemeanor."  Department of Trea-
sury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Open Letter to All 
State and Local Law Enforcement Officials, http://www.atf. 
treas.gov/firearms/information/opltrleo.htm, (last visited June 24, 
2002).

     Under current Federal law, it is illegal for persons 
     convicted of felonies to possess firearms. Yet, many 
     people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse 
     ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies. 
     At the end of the day, due to outdated laws or thinking, 
     perhaps after a plea bargain, they are, at most, convicted 
     of a misdemeanor....  Often acts of serious spouse 
     abuse are not even considered felonies....  This amend-
     ment would close this dangerous loophole and keep guns 
     away from violent individuals who threaten their own 
     families[.]
     
142 Cong. Rec. S10377-01, *S10377-78 (1996).  Fewer than 
half of the states currently have a "domestic assault" statute 
that expressly includes as elements both the use of force and 
a specific relationship between the offender and victim.12  
Most states, and the District of Columbia, charge domestic 
violence offenders under general assault statutes.  Under 
Barnes's construction, the Congress remedied one disparity--
between felony and misdemeanor domestic violence convic-
tions--while at the same time creating a new disparity among 
(and sometimes, within) states.  A person who abused his 
spouse in a state with a domestic assault statute would lose 
the right to possess a firearm while a person who engaged in 
the same conduct but was convicted of simple assault would 
not.  Moreover, Barnes's interpretation would make section 
921(a)(33)(A)(i)'s reference to a misdemeanor under "Federal 
law" a nullity because there is no federal misdemeanor that 
includes both the use of force and the domestic relationship 
as express elements.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. s 113(a)(4) (misde-
meanor simple assault within maritime or territorial jurisdic-
tion of the United States).

__________
     12 According to the district court in Smith, 964 F. Supp. at 293, in 
1997 "only seventeen of the fifty states and Puerto Rico have a law 
that would qualify under section 921(a)(33) if the domestic relation-
ship was a required element of the predicate offense."  The govern-
ment asserts that the number currently stands at nineteen.  See 
Gov't Br. at 18 n.11 (listing statutes).

     The legislative history of the Lautenberg Amendment con-
firms what the natural meaning of the statutory language 
reveals, namely that the "has as an element" language refers 
solely to the use of force.  We "do not resort to legislative 
history to cloud a statutory text that is clear," which we 
believe section 921(a)(33)(A) to be.  Were it unclear, we could 
look to legislative history to "shed new light on congressional 
intent."  U.S. Telecom Ass'n v. FBI, 276 F.3d 620, 625 (D.C. 
Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted).  In describing the 
legislation's enforcement provisions, Senator Lautenberg for-
esaw the statutory construction question central to this case:

     Mr. President, the final agreement does not merely make 
     it against the law for someone convicted of a misdemean-
     or crime of domestic violence from possessing firearms.  
     It also incorporates this new category of offenders into 
     the Brady law, which provides for a waiting period for 
     handgun purchases.  Under the Brady law, local law 
     enforcement authorities are required to make reasonable 
     efforts to ensure that those who are seeking to purchase 
     a handgun are not prohibited under Federal law from 
     doing so.  Mr. President, convictions for domestic vio-
     lence-related crimes often are for crimes, such as as-
     sault, that are not explicitly identified as related to 
     domestic violence.  Therefore, it will not always be possi-
     ble for law enforcement authorities to determine from 
     the face of someone's criminal record whether a particu-
     lar misdemeanor conviction involves domestic violence, as 
     defined in the new law.
     
142 Cong. Rec. S11872-01, *S11878 (1996) (emphasis added).  
See North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 526-27 
(1982) ("remarks ... of the sponsor of the language ultimate-
ly enacted, are an authoritative guide to the statute's con-
struction");  see also Amalgamated Transit Union v. Skin-
ner, 894 F.2d 1362, 1370 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  His statements 
express the unmistakable intent that a "misdemeanor crime 
of domestic violence" need not expressly include a domestic 
relationship element.

     The legislative history also reveals that the "has, as an 
element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the 
threatened use of a deadly weapon" language was added to 
the statute shortly before the provision was enacted.  Replac-
ing the originally proposed language that defined the predi-
cate offense as a "crime of violence," Senator Lautenberg 
explained that the addition of the "as an element" language 
was not intended to apply to the domestic relationship lan-
guage:

     Under the final agreement, the ban applies to crimes 
     that have, as an element, the use or attempted use of 
     physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.  
     This is an improvement over the earlier version, which 
     did not explicitly include within the ban crimes involving 
     an attempt to use force, or the threatened use of a 
     weapon, if such an attempt or threat did not also involve 
     actual physical violence.  In my view, anyone who at-
     tempts or threatens violence against a loved one has 
     demonstrated that he or she poses an unacceptable risk, 
     and should be prohibited from possessing firearms.
     
142 Cong. Rec. S11872-01.13  Based on our "natural meaning" 
reading of the text, we reject Barnes's interpretation of 
section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) and conclude instead that his convic-
tion under D.C. Code s 22-504(a) qualifies as a "misdemean-
or crime of domestic violence" within the meaning of the 
Lautenberg Amendment.14

__________
     13 There was concern expressed that "crime of violence" was 
potentially "too broad, and could be interpreted to include an act 
such as cutting up a credit card with a pair of scissors."  142 Cong. 
Rec. S11872-01.

     14 We also reject Barnes's invocation of the rule of lenity in 
construing the Lautenberg Amendment.  The United States Su-
preme Court stated in Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103 (1990), 
that the rule of lenity is reserved for a case in which "reasonable 
doubt persists about a statute's intended scope even after resort to 
the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating 
policies of the statute."  Id. at 108 (quotations omitted).  We have 
no such doubt regarding section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).

B.   Vagueness

     Barnes contends the district court's interpretation of sec-
tion 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) renders it unconstitutionally vague be-
cause "there is no way for a person to know from its language 
whether the relational requirement is an element of the 
predicate crime."  Barnes Br. at 16.  He further argues that 
the relationship requirement itself is infirm because "a defen-
dant convicted of simple assault cannot be sure whether he or 
she might later be held to be a 'guardian' of the victim ... or 
'similarly situated' to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the 
victim."  Id. at 17.  A similar argument has been rejected by 
two circuit courts.  See Meade, 175 F.3d at 222 (section 
921(a)(33)(A)(ii) contains no ambiguity as to either persons to 
whom prohibitions apply or proscribed conduct);  Smith, 171 
F.3d at 623 (rejecting vagueness challenge).

     To decide a vagueness challenge, we must assess whether it 
"either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so 
vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily 
guess at its meaning and differ as to its application."  United 
States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997).  We have noted 
before that "the Constitution does not require unattainable 
feats of statutory clarity."  Hutchins v. District of Columbia, 
188 F.3d 531, 546 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quotations omitted).  As 
the Eighth Circuit in Smith declared, "[w]e would be hard 
pressed to find an individual of common, or even not so 
common, intelligence who could not determine whether he 
was in one of the enumerated relationships when he commit-
ted a misdemeanor crime including an element of physical 
force."  171 F.3d at 623.  Barnes's alternative interpretation 
of the statutory text does not by itself establish vagueness.  
"Since words, by their nature, are imprecise instruments, 
even laws that easily survive vagueness challenges may have 
gray areas at the margins."  United States v. Nason, 269 
F.3d 10, 22 (1st Cir. 2001) ("use of force" in s 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) 
not unconstitutionally vague) (citing United States v. Wurz-
bach, 280 U.S. 396, 399 (1930)).  We conclude that section 
921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is sufficiently clear to reject Barnes's vague-
ness attack.

C.   Due Process

     Barnes further argues that section 922(g)(9) violates his 
due process right under the Fifth Amendment because it does 
not require the government to prove, as an element of the 
offense, that he knew his possession of a firearm was illegal.  
A long line of circuit courts has rejected this argument.  See, 
e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 209 F.3d 319, 322 (4th Cir.) 
(citing Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 192 (1992), cert. 
denied, 531 U.S. 849 (2000)).  Moreover, Barnes did not 
adequately raise this argument below and, thus, we review it 
for plain error only.15

     As we already noted, section 922(g)(9) requires the defen-
dant to "knowingly" violate the statute.  See supra at 4 n.2.  
The Supreme Court has made clear that "the knowledge 
requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowl-
edge as distinguished from knowledge of the law."  Bryan v. 
United States, 524 U.S. 184, 192 (1998) (internal quotation 
marks omitted).  The Bryan Court concluded that "unless the 
text of the statute dictates a different result, the term 'know-
ingly' merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that 
constitute the offense."  Id. at 193.  The rule in Bryan has 
been applied by other circuit courts without exception in 
interpreting section 924(a)(2), which requires that a section 
922(g)(9) offense be "knowingly" committed.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Bostic, 168 F.3d 718, 722-23 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 
527 U.S. 1029 (1999);  United States v. Beavers, 206 F.3d 706, 
708-09 (6th Cir.2000);  United States v. Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 
226 n.5 (1st Cir.1999).  Barnes knowingly possessed the fire-
arm and that is the only knowledge required to convict him.  
He argues, however, that section 922(g)(9) falls within the 
narrow exception carved out by the holding in Lambert v. 
United States, 355 U.S. 225, 228-30 (1957).  See Barnes Br. at 
19.  Lambert involved a city ordinance that made it a crime 

__________
     15 Barnes raised the issue in district court at the end of his 
memorandum in the last sentence of the last footnote and merely 
cited a dissenting opinion in United States v. Hutzell, 217 F.3d 966, 
969 (8th Cir. 2000).  See February 1, 2001 Defendant's Memoran-
dum of Law at 7 n.7 (App. 26).

for any felon to remain in Los Angeles for more than five 
days without registering with the police.  Lambert, 355 U.S. 
at 226-27.  The Supreme Court reversed the defendant's 
conviction on due process grounds because the city failed to 
establish that the defendant had notice that her "wholly 
passive conduct" could constitute a crime.  Id. at 228.  
Barnes contends that section 922(g)(9) is a similar statute 
that subjects to criminal prosecution an individual engaged in 
otherwise innocent conduct--possession of a firearm.  The 
salient fact in Lambert, however, was that the defendant had 
no reason to know, or even to attempt to discover, that she 
was required to register in order to continue living in Los 
Angeles.  Other circuit courts that have addressed this argu-
ment have uniformly rejected it.  The Sixth Circuit's observa-
tion in United States v. Beavers is instructive:

     We conclude that Beavers's conviction on a domestic 
     violence offense sufficiently placed him on notice that the 
     government might regulate his ability to own or possess 
     a firearm.  As noted in Baker and Meade, domestic 
     abuse is a well-known problem, and it should not surprise 
     anyone that the government has enacted legislation in an 
     attempt to limit the means by which persons who have a 
     history of domestic violence might cause harm in the 
     future.
     
206 F.3d at 710.  Having been convicted of a violent crime, 
Barnes had reason to know that the government could regu-
late his possession of firearms and thus he cannot avail 
himself of the limited Lambert exception.16

D.   Equal Protection

     Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) provides an exception to section 
922(g)(9) "if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or 
is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has 
had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdic-

__________
     16 The Supreme Court has steadfastly resisted efforts to expand 
Lambert's reach.  See, e.g., United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 
609 (1971) (declining to extend Lambert to possession of hand 
grenades).

tion provides for the loss of civil rights under such an 
offense)."  In the District of Columbia, as in most states, an 
individual convicted of a misdemeanor does not forfeit his civil 
rights.  Barnes argues that he is thus in a worse position 
than a person convicted in a jurisdiction that authorizes the 
loss of civil rights but can also restore them.  Claiming that 
there is no rational basis for this distinction, he asserts that 
his conviction violates equal protection.  See Barnes Br. at 21 
(citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954)).  His claim 
is without merit.

     Because domestic violence misdemeanants are not a sus-
pect class for equal protection purposes and because no 
"fundamental right" is implicated, the classification will be 
upheld "if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts 
that could provide a rational basis for the classification."  
Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 173 F.3d 898, 903 
(D.C. Cir.) (quotations omitted), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 928 
(1999).  The Congress's decision to incorporate state law 
governing forfeiture of civil rights was rational irrespective of 
differences among states regarding restoration.  Further-
more, the Congress provided other methods such as expunge-
ment and pardon that Barnes might use to come within the 
exception of section 921(a)(33).  See McGrath v. United 
States, 60 F.3d 1005, 1008 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 
U.S. 1121 (1996).

     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's 
holding that Barnes's conviction of assault under D.C. Code 
s 22-504(a) constitutes a "misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(A) and 
thus validly serves as a predicate offense for his conviction 
under 18 U.S.C. s 922(g)(9).

                                                                 So ordered.

     Sentelle, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  Defendant Barnes 
appeals from a judgment sentencing him for the violation of a 
statute which, in pertinent part, declares it "unlawful for any 
person ... who has been convicted in any court of a misde-
meanor crime of domestic violence, to ... possess ... any 
firearm...."  18 U.S.C. s 922(g)(9).  The statute defines the 
term "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as meaning 
an offense that is a misdemeanor under federal or state law;  
and "has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical 
force, or threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by 
... a person with whom the victim shares a child in com-
mon...."  18 U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(i) & (ii).

     The case before us turns on statutory interpretation.  If 
the language of a statute has a "plain and unambiguous 
meaning," our inquiry ends so long as the resulting "statutory 
scheme" is coherent and consistent.  United States v. Wilson, 
290 F.3d 347, 352 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  As I read the federal 
firearms statute at issue, Congress required that the underly-
ing misdemeanor statute of conviction must have had as an 
element "the use or attempted use of physical force, or the 
threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a [specified 
related person]."  Barnes, according to the record in the case, 
did possess a firearm and had been convicted of violating D.C. 
Code s 22-504(a), which outlaws general assaults but makes 
no mention of the status of any relationship between the 
perpetrator and the victim.  That is, the D.C. statute Barnes 
previously violated does not have as an element the use of 
force committed by one of the persons enumerated in 18 
U.S.C. s 921(a)(33)(ii).  To me, the analysis ends there.  Ap-
pellant's record offense is not included within the statutory 
definition, and the judgment appealed from cannot stand.

     The United States argues that Congress's use of the word 
"element," as opposed to "elements," means that the grava-
men of the underlying offense needs to include only the use of 
force or threatened use of force with an extra-statutory 
finding that the forbidden use or threat of force was commit-
ted by a person who bears the relevant relationship.  This 
argument has been accepted by our District Court, the major-
ity today, and at least one other circuit.  See United States v. 

Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 219 (1st Cir. 1999);  see also United 
States v. Smith, 171 F.3d 617, 620 (8th Cir. 1999) (alluding to 
the "singular term 'element' " but with little supporting or 
elucidating reasoning).  Nonetheless, with due respect to all 
the judges who have concluded otherwise, I find the argu-
ment not only unconvincing, but largely meaningless.  For 
the argument today is not how many elements are involved, 
but what the singular element is.

     As Meade properly describes it, that singular word "ele-
ment" refers "to the immediately following attribute."  
Meade, 175 F.3d at 219.  Just so, but so what?  The restate-
ment of "element" as "attribute" begs the question of what 
single element-turned-attribute the statute requires.  Just as 
an element might be either simple or complex and remain a 
single element, so might an attribute.  For example, if a 
purchaser were to express a strong desire to own a pickup 
truck which has as an attribute tires manufactured by an 
American company, that purchaser would not likely be satis-
fied to sign a contract of purchase specifying only that the 
truck "have as an attribute tires," leaving the question of 
their manufacturer for some discussion outside the contract.  
We have before us something far more important than a 
contract of sale.  We have a penal statute.  Fundamental to 
our fairness-centered criminal justice system is the rule of 
lenity for the interpretation of ambiguous penal statutes.  
See, e.g., United States v. Singleton, 182 F.3d 7, 13 & n.12 
(D.C. Cir. 1999) (collecting authorities).  Under the rule of 
lenity, a criminal defendant is, and should be, afforded the 
benefit of the doubtful application of ambiguous statutory 
language.  It cannot be gainsaid that the language of this 
statute is ambiguous.  The majority opinion itself is rife with 
allusions to its ambiguity.  "[S]ection 921(a)(33)(A) is not a 
paradigm of precise draftsmanship."  Maj. Op. at 2.  "[I]f the 
statute read [otherwise], it would be obvious that 'committed' 
modifies 'offense.' "  Maj. Op. at 8.  "If the Congress had 
more precisely articulated its intention, our task would have 
been easier."  Maj. Op. at 9.  "[T]he Congress somewhat 
awkwardly included the 'committed by' phrase in subpart 
(ii)."  Maj. Op. at 10.  The majority's grammatical and syn-

tactical analysis defending its interpretation of the statute is 
quite detailed and quite skilled.  But the necessity for such a 
detailed and skilled analysis itself illustrates the ambiguity of 
the words construed.  I would apply the rule of lenity, and I 
would reverse the judgment of the District Court.

     The supportive arguments offered by the government are 
equally unconvincing.  That a snippet of legislative history is 
more consistent with the less lenient application of a criminal 
statute hardly erodes the laudable principles of the rule of 
lenity.  This proposition seems to me quite offensive to our 
historic sense of fairness in criminal law, indeed, perhaps to 
the Due Process Clause.  Though I do not reach the constitu-
tional argument, it seems to me most inconsistent with funda-
mental fairness and certainly with the rule of lenity to 
suppose that for a defendant to understand that his conduct is 
illegal, he must read not only the words of the statute, but 
find and construe the abstruse comments of a single senator 
on a single day.  See 142 Cong. Rec. 510377-01, *510377-78 
(1996).

     As to the argument that the statute as I would construe it 
applies in fewer states than the statute as construed by the 
government, I frankly do not see how this proves anything at 
all.  The government admits in its brief that the Supreme 
Court has held repeatedly that Congress may validly and 
constitutionally adopt criminal laws that apply differently in 
different states based upon variances in state law.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U.S. 286, 293 (1958) (holding 
that Congress had constitutional authority to pass the Assimi-
lative Crimes Act, making state law applicable to federal 
enclaves within the states, and citing other statutes that 
define federal offenses based upon variances in state law);  
see also United States v. Sacco, 491 F.2d 995, 1003 (9th Cir. 
1974) (the fact that federal statute prohibiting illegal gam-
bling businesses applies only in states where gambling is 
illegal "does not result in a denial of equality").

     Finally, the majority stresses an argument based on the 
use of the word "committed" theorizing that "use of force" is 
not "committed."  I would note at the outset that this is an 

argument not made by the parties.  As a matter of first 
principles, I have no problem with that fact.  As I have 
written before, the appropriate question is not whether an 
argument is raised by the parties, but whether an issue is 
properly brought before the court.  " 'When an issue or claim 
is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the 
particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather 
retains the independent power to identify and apply the 
proper construction of governing law.' "  Eldred v. Reno, 239 
F.3d 372, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (Sentelle, J., dissenting) (quot-
ing United States Nat'l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of 
Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 446 (1993)).  However, the majority's 
reliance upon an argument not made by the parties is at least 
arguably in conflict with circuit law.  See Seattle Opera v. 
NLRB, --- F.3d ----, slip op. at 10 & n.8 (D.C. Cir. June 11, 
2002).  Nonetheless, even if we treat the argument as proper-
ly before us, I find it unconvincing.  I see no reason beyond 
the majority's ipse dixit to conclude that the "use of force" is 
not "committed" by the related person.

     In short, I respectfully dissent.
