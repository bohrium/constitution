resondent.

     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Silberman and Garland, 
Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.

     Per Curiam:  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 1292(b) (1994), de-
fendant petitions for leave to appeal an order of the district 
court denying defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's Title 
VII claim.  Defendant's petition was untimely, therefore we 
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

                                I.

     Plaintiff, Fasil Tesfaye, was employed by defendant, Carr 
Park, Inc., as a facilities manager.  On November 12, 1998, 
Carr Park fired Tesfaye.  Subsequently, Tesfaye filed a 
charge with the EEOC, on April 20, 1999, claiming that Carr 
Park had discriminatorily fired him based on his race and 
national origin in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. s 2000e et 
seq.  On June 28, 1999, sixty-nine days after Tesfaye filed his 
charge, the EEOC issued to him a right to sue letter and a 
document entitled "dismissal and notice of rights."  The 
EEOC stated that it was dismissing the charge and terminat-
ing its investigation because it was "unable to conclude that 
the information obtained establishes violations of the stat-
utes."  The notice informed Tesfaye that he had 90 days in 
which to file his claim in district court.  Tesfaye then filed 
suit in federal district court on September 27, 1999.

     Carr Park moved to dismiss the claim because Tesfaye had 
not waited 180 days after filing his charge with the EEOC 
before bringing suit in federal court.  Section 2000e-5(f)(1) 
specifically states that a charging party may file suit if the 
charge is "dismissed by the Commission, or if within one 
hundred and eighty days from the filing ... the Commission 
has not filed a civil action."  42 U.S.C. s 2000e-5(f)(1) (1994) 
(emphasis added).  Carr Park argues that notwithstanding 
the statutory language, our opinion in Martini v. Federal 
National Mortgage Ass'n, 178 F.3d 1336, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 
1999), held that the 180-day requirement is uniform even if 
the Commission has dismissed the charge earlier.  The dis-
trict judge, however, read Martini in harmony with the 
statutory wording,1 but recognizing that certain language in 

__________
     1 Martini struck down an EEOC regulation asserting authority to 
authorize a private party to sue before 180 days even if a charge 
had not been dismissed.  Id.

our opinion could be seen as in tension with the plain wording 
of the statute, certified the order for interlocutory appeal 
under 28 U.S.C. s 1292(b).  He thought that the correct 
application of Martini was a controlling question as to which 
there was substantial ground for difference of opinion and 
that immediate appeal of the issue might materially advance 
the termination of the litigation.

     Subsequently, Carr Park filed a petition for permission to 
appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 1292(b), on February 16, 
2000.  Carr Park conceded that it filed the requisite petition 
outside of the 10-day statutory filing period.  But it moved 
for leave to file the untimely petition, arguing excusable 
neglect because counsel did not have an opportunity to review 
the district court's order until he returned from an out-of-
town trial on February 14, the date the petition was due.  
And, Carr Park argued, any prejudice to Tesfaye would be de 
minimis because the petition was filed only two days late.  
Tesfaye opposed neither Carr Park's motion nor its petition 
for leave to file an interlocutory appeal.  The court referred 
the motion to the merits panel and directed the parties to 
include in their briefs arguments concerning the timeliness of 
the petition for permission to appeal.

                               II.

     Although both parties ask us to excuse the untimeliness of 
the petition, this issue calls into question our jurisdiction and 
we must address it.  See Beckett v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, 59 
F.3d 1276, 1278 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  see also City of New 
Orleans v. SEC, 137 F.3d 638, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

     Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a)(2) states that a 
petition for permission to appeal "must be filed within the 
time specified by the statute" authorizing the appeal.  In this 
case, interlocutory appeal of a certified order is permitted 
under 28 U.S.C. s 1292(b), and that statute provides that the 
court of appeals may "in its discretion, permit an appeal to be 
taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten 
days after the entry of the order."  29 U.S.C. s 1292(b) 
(emphasis added).  Although we have yet to decide the 

question, all of the circuits to address the issue have conclud-
ed that section 1292(b)'s 10-day filing period is jurisdictional.  
See Myles v. Laffitte, 881 F.2d 125, 127 (4th Cir. 1989) (listing 
cases);  see also 16 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & 
Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure s 3929, 
at 376 & n.39 (2d ed. 1996) (stating that no appeal may be 
taken if petition for permission to appeal is filed outside of 
the 10-day period specified in the statute).2  We agree that 
section 1292(b)'s filing period is jurisdictional.  Failure to file 
the petition for permission to appeal within the 10-day period 
provided by the statute deprives us of jurisdiction over the 
appeal.

     Carr Park asks us to find excusable neglect and permit the 
untimely petition.  We are without authority to do so:  no 
exception to the time for filing is set out in the statute and 
the plain language of the Federal Rules precludes us from 
enlarging the statutory time for filing a petition for permis-
sion to appeal.  The language of Rule 5 is mandatory.  See 
Fed. R. App. P. 5(a)(2).  And although Federal Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 26(b)(1) states that a court for good 
cause may extend the time prescribed by the rules, the rule 
expressly states that the court may not extend time for the 
filing of a petition for permission to appeal.  Fed. R. App. P. 
26(b)(1);  see also Myles, 881 F.2d at 126;  Aparicio v. Swan 
Lake, 643 F.2d 1109, 1111 (5th Cir. 1981);  cf. National Black 
Media Coalition v. FCC, 760 F.2d 1297, 1299 (D.C. Cir. 1985) 
(dismissing untimely petition to appeal agency decision be-
cause statute makes no exception for excusable failure and 
Fed. R. App. P. 26(b)(2) explicitly prohibits court from enlarg-
ing time for filing a notice of appeal from an agency order).

     Accordingly, we deny Carr Park's motion for leave to file a 
petition for permission to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
