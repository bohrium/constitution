     Before:  Ginsburg, Randolph, and Rogers, Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Randolph.

     Randolph, Circuit Judge:  No one may engage in surface 
coal mining without a permit issued pursuant to the Surface 
Mining Reclamation and Control Act, 30 U.S.C. s 1201 et 
seq., and the regulations thereunder.  Under the Act, States 
administer permit programs approved by the Secretary of the 
Interior as consistent with federal laws and regulations.  See 
National Mining Ass'n v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 
70 F.3d 1345, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The questions initially 
presented in this appeal dealt with the validity of several 
federal regulatory requirements imposed on permit appli-
cants, and the procedures for contesting the accuracy of 
information used to determine permit eligibility.  After oral 
argument, the Interior Department revised many of these 
regulations, and so we are faced with additional questions 
concerning the extent to which the case is now moot.

     Some of the original regulations stemmed from a consent 
decree requiring the Interior Department to "establish and 
maintain a computerized system" to track applicants and 
violators, in order to enforce 30 U.S.C. s 1260(c).  See Save 
Our Cumberland Mountains v. Clark, No. 81-2134, 1985 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 22934, at *1-*4 (D.D.C. Jan. 31, 1985);  Save 
Our Cumberland Mountains v. Watt, 550 F. Supp. 979, 980 
(D.D.C. 1982), rev'd, 725 F.2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  Section 
1260(c) provides that a permitting authority may not issue a 
permit if "the schedule [attached to the permit application] or 
other information available to the regulatory authority indi-
cates that any surface coal mining operation owned or con-
trolled by the applicant is currently in violation of this 
chapter ... [unless] ... the applicant submits proof that such 
violation has been corrected or is in the process of being 
corrected."  30 U.S.C. s 1260(c).

     In compliance with the consent decree, the Interior Depart-
ment's Office of Surface Mining created the Applicant/Viola-

tor System ("AVS").  The AVS is a computerized database 
"programmed to identify 'links' between known violators and 
applicants, individuals, and corporations."  Sam P. Burchett, 
The Applicant Violator System in Transition, 21 N. Ky. L. 
Rev. 555 n.5 (1994).  The Office of Surface Mining operates 
the database and makes it available to the public on dedicated 
terminals and the Internet.  See Office of Surface Mining, 
Access, at http://www.avs.osmre.gov/pubaccess.htm (last visit-
ed Dec. 5, 2000).

     The National Mining Association (NMA) brought this ac-
tion to set aside aspects of the AVS and related regulations.  
NMA objected to the AVS rules both because of the informa-
tion required of applicants and because of what is purportedly 
done with the information.  The district court granted sum-
mary judgment in favor of the Interior Department, sustain-
ing all of the regulations.

     The case was argued before us in November 2000.  In 
December 2000, the Interior Department published a rule, 
effective January 18, 2001, replacing the AVS rule at issue in 
this appeal.  See Application and Permit Information Re-
quirements;  Permit Eligibility;  Definitions of Ownership and 
Control;  the Applicant/Violator System;  Alternative Enforce-
ment, 65 Fed. Reg. 79,582 (Dec. 19, 2000) (to be codified at 30 
C.F.R.) [hereinafter AVS Rules].  We ordered supplemental 
briefing on the question of mootness.

                                I.

     To determine whether anything remains of NMA's case, we 
need to identify which regulations NMA challenged and 
whether the new rules altered those regulations.  This is no 
small task.  NMA, in its complaint, did not see fit to provide 
citations to all of the regulations it thought invalid.  Even in 
its briefs in this court, NMA is content to refer generally to 
"the rules" without, in many instances, providing any citations 
to the C.F.R.  Perhaps this results from NMA's habit of 
describing what "the rules" prohibit when in fact NMA's real 
complaint is that "the rules" do not affirmatively require what 
NMA desires.

     At any rate, by our count NMA specifically argued against 
the following old AVS rules issued by the Office of Surface 
Mining:  30 C.F.R. ss 773.5, 773.20(c), 773.23(b), 773.24, 
773.25 & 778.14(c) (1999).  In its supplemental brief, NMA 
agrees with the government that the new AVS rules moot its 
challenges to ss 773.20(c), 773.23(b), 773.24 & 773.25.  See 
Supplemental Brief of Appellant at 4, 11.  NMA also agrees 
that its contention about the lack of any provision to allow 
provisional permits is moot because the new rules fill the gap.  
See AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,664-65 (to be codified at 
30 C.F.R. s 773.14).

     As to NMA's remaining challenges to the regulations, some 
are also moot and the rest are meritless.

                                A.

     NMA mounted a scattershot due process attack on the old 
AVS rules.  Its main objections were that the rules did not 
give notice, and did not give applicants the chance to contest 
links to them on the AVS before these were posted and used 
to deny applications.  NMA brought the case as a facial 
challenge to the rules.  Yet NMA conceded at oral argument 
that even by its lights, "the rules" could be constitutionally 
applied in some cases.  Whether that concession should have 
ended this aspect of the case under the doctrine that a law 
valid in some of its applications cannot be struck down as 
invalid on its face is a question we leave to another day.  
Compare United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987);  
Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301 (1993);  INS v. National 
Ctr. for Immigrants' Rights, 502 U.S. 183, 188 (1991);  Chemi-
cal Waste Mgmt. v. EPA, 56 F.3d 1434, 1437 (D.C. Cir. 1995);  
with National Mining Ass'n v. Army Corps of Engineers, 
145 F.3d 1399, 1407-08 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  We also leave to 
another day the question whether the sort of generalized due 
process attack NMA advanced would be ripe under the 
doctrine of Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 
(1967).  See Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 
1023 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  We leave these questions undecid-

ed because NMA's due process claims are moot in light of the 
new AVS rules.

     In order to evaluate a procedural due process claim, a court 
must evaluate the "risk of an erroneous deprivation of [a 
property] interest through the procedures used, and the 
probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural 
safeguards."  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).  
Although the new AVS rules, like the old rules, contain no 
explicit provision allowing an owner to challenge a violation's 
status before it has been entered into the AVS, see AVS 
Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,666 (to be codified at 30 C.F.R. 
s 773.25(a)), the new rules add other procedural protections.  
Responding to due process concerns, the Office of Surface 
Mining's new 30 C.F.R. s 773.14, provides that an entity 
challenging AVS listings may be entitled to a provisional 
permit.  See AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,664.  This affects 
the Mathews v. Eldridge calculus.  The old set of rules, which 
are the subject of this lawsuit, cannot be evaluated as if 
nothing has changed.  A new system is now in place.  We 
therefore must vacate this aspect of the district court's deci-
sion as moot.  See Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 386, 
388-89 (1975);  see also Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U.S. 119, 128 
(1977) (suggesting that mootness determination can be col-
ored by interest in avoiding premature constitutional adjudi-
cation).

                                B.

     NMA argued that the definition of "owned and controlled" 
in s 773.5 of the old regulations was unconstitutionally vague 
and that the Office of Surface Mining should have adopted 
substantive rebuttal standards to overcome the presumptions 
set forth in the definition.  See Brief of Appellant at 39-40.  
The new rules eliminate the presumptions and, in place of the 
former definition of "owned or controlled," substitute two new 
definitions of "own, owner, or ownership" and "control or 
controller."  See AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,662 (to be 
codified at 30 C.F.R. s 701.5).  The new rules also list the 
types of information one may use to rebut an ownership or 

control linkage in the AVS.  See AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 
79,666 (to be codified at 30 C.F.R. s 773.25(c)).  In light of 
these substantial changes, NMA's vagueness challenge is 
moot.  Any opinion regarding the former rules would be 
merely advisory.

                                C.

     Section 778.14(c) of the old rules required applicants to 
submit "[a] list of all violation notices received by the appli-
cant during the three-year period preceding the application 
date, and a list of all outstanding violation notices received 
prior to the date of the application by any surface coal mining 
operation that is deemed to be owned or controlled by the 
applicant."  30 C.F.R. s 778.14(c) (1999).  Because the new 
version of s 778.14(c) is to the same effect, see AVS Rules, 65 
Fed. Reg. at 79,669 (to be codified at 30 C.F.R. s 773.14(c)), 
NMA's claim that the rule exceeds the Interior Department's 
statutory authority is not moot.

     Under the Act, applicants must list all "notices of violations 
... incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface 
coal mining operation during the three-year period prior to 
the date of application."  30 U.S.C. s 1260(c).  The rule, 
NMA points out, seeks information beyond the three-year 
cutoff--namely, "a list of all outstanding violation notices 
received prior to the date of the application by any surface 
coal mining operation that is deemed to be owned or con-
trolled by the applicant" regardless of the date.  This is true, 
but not determinative.  NMA fails to appreciate the distinc-
tion between violations incurred by the applicant and viola-
tions incurred by entities owned or controlled by the appli-
cant.  The three-year cutoff in s 1260(c) of the Act applies 
only to violations by the applicant itself;  it does not place any 
time limit on the other information s 778.14(c) of the regula-
tions requires.  We have held that "the Act's explicit listings 
of information required of permit applicants are not exhaus-
tive, and do not preclude the Secretary from requiring the 
states to secure additional information needed to ensure 
compliance with the Act."  In re Permanent Surface Mining 

Regulation Litig., 653 F.2d 514, 527 (D.C. Cir. 1981);  see 
National Mining Ass'n v. Department of the Interior, 177 
F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  There is not the slightest doubt 
that the information sought through the regulation will help 
ensure compliance with the Act.  Under s 1260(c), a permit 
may not be granted to an applicant if such related entities are 
in violation of the Act at the time of the application and have 
not taken steps to rectify the situation.  We therefore reject 
NMA's attack on s 778.14(c).

                                D.

     This brings us to NMA's claim that the old rules violate 
"state primacy."  By "state primacy," NMA refers to the 
Act's giving power to state agencies to issue permits pursuant 
to federally-approved state programs.  See 30 U.S.C. 
s 1260(a).  The Department of the Interior is empowered to 
approve or disapprove state programs, see 30 U.S.C. 
s 1253(b), and to establish regulatory requirements for these 
programs, see 30 U.S.C. s 1251(b).  But once the Secretary 
approves a program, permits are to be issued and revoked by 
the designated "regulatory authority," rather than the Interi-
or Department.  See also Bragg v. West Virginia Coal Ass'n, 
No. 99-2443, 2001 WL 410382, at *3-*4 (4th Cir. Apr. 24, 
2001) (describing the "cooperative federalism" envisioned by 
the statute).

     According to NMA, the old rules "effectively strip[ped] the 
state of its exclusive permitting authority under s 510 [of the 
Act], prohibiting the state from issuing a permit if the 
applicant [was] shown in the AVS as linked to:  unabated 
violations issued by other states;  or violations issued by 
OSM."  See Brief of Appellant at 51.  The offending rules 
were s 773.23(b) and ss 773.24-.25, which NMA described as 
prohibiting a "state from allowing the applicant to demon-
strate that :  (1) it is not linked by ownership/control to the 
alleged violator(s);  (2) that the violations have been abated;  
or (3) that the violations are invalid."  Id.  In its supplemen-
tal brief NMA admits that the rule (30 C.F.R. 
s 773.25(b)(3)(i)) giving the Office of Surface Mining "plenary 

authority" over information on the AVS has been removed.  
We think the rest of NMA's state primacy challenge is also 
moot.

     NMA also contended that state primacy was undercut by 
30 C.F.R. s 773.23(b)(2) (1999), which, it claimed, barred 
states from issuing permits when the AVS showed links to 
unabated violations issued by other states or by OSM.  It is 
by no means clear that the new regulations continue this 
practice.  Under the new s 773.11(a), a regulatory authority 
is required to review information from the AVS as well as 
"any other available information" to establish an applicant's 
compliance history.  AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,664 (to be 
codified at 30 C.F.R. s 773.11).  Section 773.12 directs the 
regulatory authority to make its decision based on the infor-
mation gathered under s 773.11.  See id. (to be codified at 30 
C.F.R. s 773.12).  There is no readily apparent provision 
indicating that information from the AVS is to be given 
controlling weight.  Likewise, there is nothing in the new 
s 773.23 that indicates that AVS information should control a 
regulatory authority's decision to rescind a permit as improvi-
dently issued.  See AVS Rules, 65 Fed. Reg. at 79,665 (to be 
codified at 30 C.F.R. s 773.23).  Since nothing indicates that 
the new regulations require AVS information to control state 
decisions, the remainder of NMA's state primacy challenge is 
moot.

                                E.

     Because rules of the Interior Department's Office of Hear-
ing and Appeals (OHA) were not changed by the new rule-
making, NMA's original challenge to those rules--43 C.F.R. 
ss 4.1374 and 4.1384--presents a live controversy.  Both 
rules place the "burden of persuasion" on those challenging 
the validity of a decision to rescind a permit as improvidently 
granted (s 4.1374(b)), and to those challenging decisions of 
the Office of Surface Mining regarding an ownership or 
control link in the AVS or the status of a violation reported 
there (s 4.1384(b)).

     When it originally promulgated these regulations, the Of-
fice of Surface Mining thought that such an allocation of the 

burden of proof was permitted by s 7(c) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act.  See Use of the Applicant/Violator System in 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval;  
Standards and Procedures for Ownership and Control Deter-
minations, 59 Fed. Reg. 54,306, 54,360 (Oct. 28, 1994) [herein-
after Use of the AVS] (citing APA s 7(c), 5 U.S.C. s 556(d)).  
Relying on our decision in Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. 
v. EPA, 548 F.2d 998 (D.C. Cir. 1976), it concluded that "OSM 
properly bears only the burden of going forward with proof, 
not the ultimate burden of persuasion."  Use of the AVS, 59 
Fed. Reg. at 54,360.

     Section 7(c) says that "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by 
statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of 
proof."  5 U.S.C. s 556(d).  In Environmental Defense Fund, 
we interpreted "burden of proof" to mean only the burden of 
production or "going forward."  See Environmental Def. 
Fund, 548 F.2d at 1004 & n.14.  The Supreme Court, in dicta, 
later agreed with us.  See NLRB v. Transportation Mgmt. 
Corp., 462 U.S. 393, 404 n.7 (1983).  However, shortly before 
the Department of the Interior approved the rules in this 
case, the Supreme Court changed its position.  In Greenwich 
Collieries, it concluded that the "burden of proof" in s 7(c) 
meant "the burden of persuasion."  Director, Office of Work-
ers' Comp. Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 
276 (1994).

     NMA argues that the regulations cannot be valid because 
they shift the burden of proof, in violation of the Administra-
tive Procedure Act.  But this argument only succeeds if one 
ignores the other language in s 7(c).  The statute says that 
the proponent of an order bears the burden of proof "[e]xcept 
as otherwise provided by statute."  5 U.S.C. s 776(d) (empha-
sis added).  We have already concluded that the power to 
suspend permits that were improvidently granted derives 
from OSM's power to "order the suspension, revocation, or 
withholding of any permit for failure to comply with any of 
the provisions of this chapter or any rules and regulations 
adopted pursuant thereto."  30 U.S.C. s 1211(c)(1);  National 
Mining Ass'n v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 177 F.3d 
1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  We have also concluded that the 

obligation to comply with the provisions of this chapter means 
the obligation to comply with the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 
s 1260(c).  That section provides that when the regulatory 
authority is aware of an "operation owned or controlled by 
the applicant [that] is currently in violation" of state or 
federal rules, "the permit shall not be issued until the appli-
cant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or 
is in the process of being corrected."  30 U.S.C. s 1260(c) 
(emphasis added).  In short, Congress has allocated the 
burden of proving compliance with the Act.  Cf. Steadman v. 
SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 96-97 (1981) (applying standards of proof 
from s 7(c) because Congress had not otherwise provided).  
If, at any point, a permit-holder is unable to submit proof that 
its permit is not linked to a violator, it is no longer in 
compliance with s 1260(c) and the Secretary may rescind the 
permit.  It follows that when challenging OSM's decision to 
rescind a permit as improvidently granted, the permit holder 
properly bears the burden of persuasion.

     43 C.F.R. s 4.1374 covers only decisions to rescind improvi-
dently granted permits.  But the same allocation of burdens 
of proof is made in 43 C.F.R. s 4.1384 (1999), which governs 
review of OSM's decisions regarding the existence and status 
of ownership and control links in the AVS.  NMA contends 
that OSM should bear the burden of proving that a linkage 
should be entered into the AVS at all.  To NMA, the OSM is 
the "proponent" of an administrative order to enter informa-
tion into the AVS, and s 4.1384 is invalid even if s 4.1374 is 
valid.  But this view distorts the statute:  30 U.S.C. s 1260(c) 
places the burden of proof on the applicant, and no one else.  
The regulatory authority deciding whether to issue a permit 
uses the AVS as a source of information about potential 
violations.  If NMA's view were correct, then the question 
whether the permit should be issued would shift from a 
proceeding before a state regulatory agency where the appli-
cant bears the burden of proof to a federal proceeding over 
the accuracy of the AVS information where OSM bears the 
burden of proof.  That result is inconsistent with the statute.

     It is true that the Interior Department did not explicitly 
rely on the foregoing rationale in its preamble to the OHA 
rules.  Ordinarily, when an agency reaches the proper conclu-
sion for the wrong reasons, the courts remand the rule to the 
agency for further consideration.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 
318 U.S. 80, 95 (1943).  However, we do not do so here.  
When the language of the statute commands a particular 
outcome--as 30 U.S.C. ss 1211 and 1260 do here--the fact 
that the agency states an incorrect legal rationale is insuffi-
cient to require a remand.  See Motion Picture Ass'n of Am. 
v. Oman, 969 F.2d 1154, 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  In this case, a 
remand would be pointless.  As Judge Friendly stated, 
"Chenery does not mean that any assignment of a wrong 
reason calls for reversal and remand;  this is necessary only 
when the reviewing court concludes there is a significant 
chance that but for the error the agency might have reached 
a different result."  Henry J. Friendly, Chenery Revisited:  
Reflections on Reversal and Remand of Administrative Or-
ders, 1969 Duke L.J. 199, 211.

                               II.

     We therefore vacate the district court's judgment with 
regard to the following challenges:  (1) the due process chal-
lenge to "the rules" as a whole;  (2) the challenge to the rules' 
lack of provisional permits;  (3) the challenge to 30 C.F.R. 
s 773.5 (1999) as vague as well as the lack of rebuttal 
standards;  (4) the claim that the rules--specifically, 30 
C.F.R. ss 773.23, 773.24 & 773.25 (1999)--violated the Act's 
"state primacy" requirement.  With regard to each of these 
challenges, we order that the district court dismiss them as 
moot.  We affirm the district court's ruling that 30 C.F.R. 
s 778.14 (1999) does not impermissibly require extra informa-
tion, and that the Office of Hearing and Appeals rules, 43 
C.F.R. ss 4.1374, 4.1384 (1999), do not improperly shift the 
burden of proof.

                                                                       So ordered.
