     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Ginsburg and Rogers, 
Circuit Judges.

       Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  In In re Sealed Case No. 97-3112 
(Sentencing Guidelines' "Substantial Assistance"), 181 F.3d 
128 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (in banc), the court held that a district 
court may not invoke s 5K1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guide-
lines ("U.S.S.G." or "the Guidelines") to sentence a criminal 
defendant below the guideline range for the prescribed of-
fense except upon motion by the government " 'stating that 

the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the 
investigation or prosecution of another person who has com-
mitted an offense.' "  Id. at 130 (quoting U.S.S.G. s 5K1.1, 
p.s. (1997)).  Appellant contends that there is an exception to 
the motion requirement where the assistance relates to a 
District of Columbia offense, and hence the district court 
erred in denying his departure request.  Specifically, he 
contends that the term "offense" in s 5K1.1 refers solely to 
federal offenses, and that he thus may receive a departure 
below the level prescribed by the Guidelines on the basis of 
his assistance to law enforcement officers with regard to a 
homicide prosecution under the District of Columbia Code, 
even though the government never filed a motion in support 
of such departure.  Because appellant never presented this 
argument to the district court, our review is for plain error 
and we find none.

                                I.

     "[A] request for an adjustment under the Guidelines is 
[forfeited] if the argument is not made at sentencing," and 
this court "will review sentencing issues raised for the first 
time on appeal [only] for 'plain error.' "  United States v. 
Foster, 988 F.2d 206, 209 (D.C. Cir. 1993);  see United States 
v. Klat, 156 F.3d 1258, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (plain error 
review applied to departures as well as adjustments not 
requested in the district court);  United States v. Ortez, 902 
F.2d 61, 64 (D.C. Cir. 1990);  see also United States v. Olano, 
507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993).  While our plain error review in the 
sentencing context requires a "slightly less exacting" showing 
of prejudice than for trial errors, see United States v. Saro, 
24 F.3d 283, 287 (D.C. Cir. 1994), an appellant must still show 
that "from the perspective of the trial court[,] the error [was] 
'so "plain" [that] the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict 
in countenancing it, even absent the defendant's timely assis-
tance in detecting it.' "  Id. at 286 (quoting United States v. 
Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163 (1982)).

     Appellant pleaded guilty to one count of a ten count 
indictment, and was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment 
after receiving a downward departure under United States v. 
Smith, 27 F.3d 649 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  In appealing his sen-
tence, he concedes that in seeking a downward departure for 

cooperation that he had provided to the government in con-
nection with a homicide prosecution in the Superior Court of 
the District of Columbia, he did not specifically argue in the 
district court that s 5K1.1 was inapplicable because his coop-
eration related to a non-federal offense.  The closest he came 
to raising the issue was when he stated in his first memoran-
dum in aid of sentencing that "under U.S.S.G. s 5K2.0 ... 
[his] assistance augurs in favor of a downward departure."1  
Appellant made no mention of s 5K1.1 as a separate ground 
and did not explain why s 5K2.0 authorized departure in his 
case.  In his second memorandum in aid of sentencing he 
argued that s 5K1.1 was invalid because Congress had man-
dated that departures based upon cooperation with the gov-
ernment be addressed through sentencing guidelines while 
s 5K1.1 is a policy statement,2 and that the district court 

__________
     1 Section 5K2.0 identifies "some of the factors that the [U.S. 
Sentencing] Commission has not been able to take into account fully 
in formulating the [G]uidelines", in order to provide guidance to 
courts in applying 18 U.S.C. s 3553(b)(1997).  Thus the Guideline, 
in discussing s 3553(b), states that a court:

     may impose a sentence outside the range established by the 
     applicable guideline, if the court finds 'that there exists an 
     aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a 
     degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sen-
     tencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should 
     result in a sentence different from that described.'
     
U.S.S.G. s 5K2.0, p.s. (1997) (quoting 18 U.S.C. s 3553(b)).

     2 This argument has since been rejected by In re Sealed Case No. 
97-3112, 149 F.3d 1198, 1200-01 (D.C. Cir. 1998), vacated in part on 
other grounds, 159 F.3d 1362 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  See also In re 
Sealed Case No. 97-3112, 181 F.3d at 131 n.3.  Furthermore, the 
argument is unpersuasive on its face, inasmuch as Congress ex-
pressly authorized the Sentencing Commission to issue general 
policy statements regarding application of the Guidelines.  See 28 
U.S.C. s 994(a)(2)(1993).  Indeed, the court's language in rejecting 
this position was unequivocal:  "we have no doubt that the Commis-
sion's decision to issue a policy statement rather than a guideline in 
response to section 994(n) amounted to a permissible, if not the only 
reasonable, construction of the statute."  In re Sealed Case No. 
97-3112, 149 F.3d at 1201.

thus retained general authority under 18 U.S.C. s 3553(b) to 
depart on the basis of his cooperation, even absent a govern-
ment motion for departure.  At a subsequent hearing, the 
district court rejected appellant's s 5K1.1 argument, ruling 
that it lacked authority to depart on the basis of appellant's 
cooperation "in the absence of a 5K1.1 letter" from the 
government.  Thus, appellant never argued to the district 
court that s 5K1.1, or any other authority, authorized depar-
ture absent a government motion because of the non-federal 
case on which appellant assisted the government.

     On appeal appellant contends only that the district court 
erred in failing to depart under s 5K2.0, given the non-
federal nature of the offense on which he assisted the govern-
ment.  Yet contrary to appellant's apparent position, it is not 
enough for purposes of preserving an argument for appeal for 
the defendant to discuss the general circumstances of his case 
without in some manner signaling to the district court how 
those circumstances bear on the district court's authority to 
grant a downward departure request in the absence of a 
government motion.  As the court has recently observed in 
an analogous case:

     To be sure, Vizcaino was not required to state the issue 
     as clearly as appellate counsel has, or, for that matter, 
     even to cite to section 5K2.0 in order to preserve the 
     issue for appeal.  But absent any statement that the 
     district court could have reasonably interpreted as argu-
     ing that crack so distorted the sentence as to take it out 
     of the Guidelines' heartland, we cannot conclude that 
     Vizcaino preserved the issue.
     
United States v. Vizcaino, No. 99-3033, 2000 WL 126769, at 
*3 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2000) (and distinguishing United States 
v. Beckham, 968 F.2d 47 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).  So too here, 
appellant never made the argument to the district court that 
he raises on appeal, and to the extent that he referred to 
s 5K2.0 and s 3553(b), he never suggested to the district 
court why either would entitle him to a departure because of 
his non-federal cooperation, while his reliance on the latter 
was based upon an argument since rejected by this court.  
See supra note 2.  Therefore, because the issue of whether 

the district court had authority to depart under s 5K2.0 
based on appellant's assistance on a non-federal offense was 
never presented in the district court, it was forfeited and our 
review is for plain error.  See Vizcaino, 2000 WL 126769, at 
*3;  Saro, 24 F.3d at 286.

     The only question, therefore, is whether it was incumbent 
on the district court sua sponte to consider whether s 5K1.1 
was inapplicable to appellant's request for departure based 
upon his cooperation in connection with a homicide prosecu-
tion under District of Columbia law because the issue was 
"plain," that is, either because the language of s 5K1.1 distin-
guished between federal and local offenses, or there was 
persuasive judicial authority for making that distinction, or 
the legal norm at issue was absolutely clear.  See United 
States v. Merlos, 8 F.3d 48, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  Appellant 
does not suggest that the latter consideration is relevant 
here, and we agree.  Thus, absent clear language in the 
Guidelines, or precedent from the Supreme Court, this court, 
or another circuit court of appeals at the time of appellant's 
sentencing that s 5K1.1 applied only to cooperation in con-
nection with federal offenses, it would seem to follow that the 
"failure to recognize authority to depart ...  falls far short of 
plain error."  Vizcaino, 2000 WL 126769, at *3.

     The language of s 5K1.1 makes no distinction between 
local and federal offenses and merely uses the term "offense":  
"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant 
has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or 
prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, 
the court may depart from the guidelines."  U.S.S.G. s 5K1.1 
(first paragraph).  Essentially, appellant maintains that ac-
cording to the definition of "offense" in the Commentary to 
s 1B1.1,3 the meaning of that term as used in s 5K1.1 must 

__________
     3 The commentary to s 1B1.1 provides in relevant part:

     "Offense" means the offense of conviction and all relevant 
     conduct under s 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different 
     meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.  
     The term "instant" is used in connection with "offense," "feder-
     al offense," or "offense of conviction" as the case may be, to 
     
be determined contextually;  that is, in appellant's view, the 
narrow definition of "offense" in s 1B1.1 "does not fit the 
s 5K1.1 formulation" because it refers to the offense of 
conviction rather than the offense to which assistance was 
provided.  Because, appellant maintains, the Guidelines al-
ways refer expressly to non-federal offenses when they are to 
be included in the term "offense," the unadorned use of that 
term in s 5K1.1 should be interpreted to refer only to federal 
offenses.  Appellant also relies on the fact that the Guidelines 
have sometimes included a separate definition when offenses 
under state, tribal, or military law are to be included.  Yet for 
plain error purposes it is not obvious that offenses under 
District of Columbia law are excluded from s 5K1.1.

     First, the second sentence in the definition commentary to 
s 1B1.1 indicates that the term "offense" is broader than 
federal offenses.  That explicit statements exist in other 
sections of the Guidelines describing the covered offenses to 
include non-federal offenses is hardly dispositive on plain 
error review.  Compare s 5K2.9 p.s. and s 5G1.3(b) with 
s 2K2.1, comment (nn.7 & 14);  s 4A1.1, comment (backg'd).  
Indeed, to the extent that appellant relies on "[t]he legislative 
antecedents of s 5K1.1," he suggests that there is nothing 
obvious in s 5K1.1 to show that it excludes District of Colum-
bia offenses.

     Second, appellant's reliance on context is self-defeating.  
Because of the unique prosecutorial arrangement in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, a sentencing judge in this district would be 
particularly unlikely to see obvious error in applying s 5K1.1 
to cooperation involving local prosecutions.  Unlike other 
districts in which the role of the United States Attorney does 
not blur the distinction between federal and state prosecu-
tions, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia 
serves as both a federal and District of Columbia prosecutor

     distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being 
     sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an 
     offense before another court (e.g. an offense before a state 
     court involving the same underlying conduct).

and even has authority to join local offenses to federal 
charges.  See D.C. Code ss 23-101(c),(d)(1981) (ann.).

     Finally, appellant has not pointed to a single case decided 
before his sentencing that supported his interpretation of 
s 5K1.1.  In fact, as of appellant's sentencing, the Second, 
Third, and Ninth Circuits had all rejected his argument.  See 
United States v. Kaye, 65 F.3d 240, 242 (2d Cir. 1995), 
vacated, 140 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 1998);  United States v. Emery, 
34 F.3d 911, 913 (9th Cir. 1994);  United States v. Love, 985 
F.2d 732, 733 (3d Cir. 1993).  Indeed, appellant's counsel 
conceded during oral argument in this court that there was 
no judicial authority whatsoever in his favor at the time of his 
sentencing.  Although the Second Circuit later reconsidered 
its decision and adopted appellant's interpretation of s 5K1.1, 
this decision upon reconsideration came after appellant was 
sentenced and therefore does not influence our review for 
plain error.

     Because neither the language of s 5K1.1 nor judicial or 
other authority in existence at the time of appellant's sentenc-
ing would have caused the district court on its own to have 
considered that there might be such an issue in appellant's 
favor, much less apposite authority even now to demonstrate 
plain error, the district court did not plainly err in denying 
appellant's request for a downward departure under s 5K2.0.  
Accordingly, without reaching the merits of appellant's under-
lying legal argument, we affirm the judgment of conviction.
