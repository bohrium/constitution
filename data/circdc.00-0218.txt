Circuit Judges.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Henderson.

     Karen Lecraft Henderson, Circuit Judge:  Laurie Jones 
Canady petitions for review of two orders of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC):  the first barred her from 
future association with any securities broker or dealer and 
directed her to disgorge commissions for having violated 
section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. s 77q(a), 
section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,15 U.S.C. 
s 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. s 240.10b-5, and the 
second denied reconsideration of the first.  Canady chal-
lenges the orders on the sole ground that most of the violative 
conduct occurred more than five years before the enforce-
ment proceeding was commenced and therefore fell outside 
the limitation period established in 28 U.S.C. s 2462.1  The 
SEC concluded in its review order that Canady had waived 
the defense by failing to argue it, even after one of the 
commissioners questioned her counsel about the defense dur-
ing oral argument.  We hold the SEC's waiver conclusion in 
the review order must be upheld as neither arbitrary nor 
capricious and that we lack jurisdiction to review the Com-
mission's order denying reconsideration.

                                I.

     On October 25, 1994 the SEC Division of Enforcement 
commenced this proceeding alleging that from January 1988 

__________
     1 Section 2462 provides:

          Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an action, 
     suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, 
     or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained 
     unless commenced within five years from the date when the 
     claim first accrued if, within the same period, the offender or 
     the property is found within the United States in order that 
     proper service may be made thereon.
     
28 U.S.C. s 2462.

to February 1990 Canady, a Davenport, Iowa registered 
securities broker, violated section 17(a), section 10(b) and 
Rule 10b-5 through fraudulent misrepresentations and non-
disclosures and by conducting transactions that were unau-
thorized or not in the interests of her clients.  JA 20-21.  On 
October 31, 1995, after a two-week hearing, the administra-
tive law judge (ALJ) issued an Initial Decision permanently 
barring Canady from association with the securities profes-
sion and ordering her to disgorge $136,382.28 in commissions 
improperly earned on the accounts of 14 investors.  JA 243.

     On December 4, 1995 Canady petitioned the Commission 
for review, and on December 7, 1995 the Commission granted 
review and set a briefing schedule.  Canady filed her review 
brief on February 6, 1995.  During oral argument on June 22, 
1998, one of the commissioners asked Canady's counsel for his 
thoughts on "the applicability of Patricia Johnson," referring 
to this court's June 21, 1996 decision in Johnson v. SEC, 87 
F.3d 484 (D.C. Cir. 1996), which held that an SEC enforce-
ment action seeking censure and a six-month suspension from 
the securities profession is "an action, suit, or proceeding for 
the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecu-
niary or otherwise" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. s 2462 
and therefore subject to the statute's five-year limitation 
period.  Counsel responded:

          I think it's, I think it's striking because Patricia 
     Johnson is a case that ultimately, because of the five 
     years that went by, was a, I think a mistake to even 
     proceed with.  Here we have someone who, ten years 
     ago almost ten years ago, left the business as we stand 
     here today.
     
          We were talking about, actually eight years, eight and 
     a half years and you have to ask why are we doing--why 
     are we pursuing this?  Why did they pursue it?  And I 
     think that once they made that determination that this is 
     a bad person who over reached her customers, the 
     Commission was willing--the Division was willing to stop 
     at almost nothing to see if they could not convict her of 
     wrong doing.
     
JA 596.  When asked later during the argument why he had 
not "raised the Patricia Johnson issue in the lower proceed-
ings," counsel responded that he had not had an opportunity 
because the ALJ proceeding was concluded and the briefs on 
review already filed when Johnson issued.  He further ex-
plained he did not believe he could file a reply brief under 
Commission rules, which he was "not, unfortunately, that 
familiar with."  JA 615-16.

     In an opinion and order dated April 5, 1999 the Commission 
upheld the ALJ's findings that Canady defrauded and mis-
managed the accounts of the four clients who testified before 
the ALJ but rejected the ALJ's findings as to the other ten, 
non-testifying clients.  The Commission's decision again or-
dered a lifetime bar from the securities industry and dis-
gorgement, directing the disgorgement amount to be adjusted 
in accordance with the Commission's amended findings.  Re-
garding section 2462 the Commission stated, in part:

          It is well-established that " '[r]eliance on a statute of 
     limitations is an affirmative defense and is waived if a 
     party does not raise it in a timely fashion.' " Canady's 
     failure to raise the statute of limitations in this case 
     constitutes a waiver of that claim.
     
          Even when asked directly at oral argument to address 
     the applicability of Johnson, Canady's counsel responded 
     only vaguely and without reference to Section 2462 that 
     the proceedings should never have been instituted and 
     now--having been appealed to us--were aged.  Although 
     the Johnson decision issued after briefing was completed 
     in this case, the District of Columbia Circuit had applied 
     section 2462 to administrative proceedings as early as 
     March 1994.  Respondents in other administrative pro-
     ceedings brought by this Commission, including the 
     Johnson respondents, raised Section 2462 as an affirma-
     tive defense before the appellate court's decision in John-
     son.
     
          In deeming Canady to have forfeited a statute of 
     limitations defense, we are furthering both fairness and 
     efficiency.  As the District of Columbia Circuit has held, 
     
     a party claiming the statute of limitations defense must 
     give adequate notice of that claim in order to permit the 
     other side "not only to frame legal arguments, but to 
     establish relevant facts that might affect the applicability 
     of the statute of limitations."  Canady's failure to raise 
     the claim deprived the Division of such notice and oppor-
     tunity to develop its factual and legal defenses to the 
     claim.
     
JA 573-76 (quoting citing Harris v. Secretary, United States 
Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 126 F.3d 339, 343, 344 (D.C. Cir. 
1997);  footnotes and other citations omitted).

     On May 1, 1999 Canady filed a timely request for reconsid-
eration of the Commission's April 5, 1999 order, arguing at 
last that section 2462 deprived the Commission of jurisdiction.  
She further argued that she had not waived the statute of 
limitations defense.  See JA 439-43.  In a decision dated 
August 6, 1999 the Commission denied reconsideration, noting 
Canady's "inaction" in not pursuing the defense, not even "in 
the period between oral argument and issuance of [the Com-
mission's] decision" after the Commission itself had raised the 
issue.  JA 580.  Canady then filed a petition for review with 
this court.

                               II.

     As an initial matter we hold we are without jurisdiction to 
review the Commission's denial of reconsideration. Denial of 
agency reconsideration is "generally nonreviewable unless the 
request for reconsideration was based on new evidence or 
changed circumstances." Schoenbohm v. FCC, 204 F.3d 243, 
246 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive 
Eng'rs, 482 U.S. 270, 279-80 (1987);  Southwestern Bell Tel. 
Co. v. FCC, 180 F.3d 307, 311 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  Entravision 
Holdings, LLC v. FCC, 202 F.3d 311, 312 n. * (D.C. Cir.
2000)), petition for cert. filed, No. 00-6095 (July 28, 2000).  
Because Canady asserted neither ground in moving for recon-
sideration below,2 we may not review the Commission's denial 

__________
     2 Canady did file a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence 
which the Commission denied in its reconsideration decision.  The 

of her motion.3

     We next consider Canady's challenge to the Commission's 
holding in the April 5, 1999 order on review that she waived 
her statute of limitations defense.  Under the Administrative 
Procedure Act, we "will set aside [the Commission's] legal 
conclusions only if 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre-
tion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,' 5 U.S.C. 
s 706(2)(A)."  Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 412 (D.C. Cir. 
2000) (internal quotation omitted).  Because the Commis-
sion's waiver holding satisfies this standard, we conclude it 
must be upheld.

     In support of its waiver conclusion the Commission specifi-
cally cited two provisions of the SEC's procedural rules.  The 
first rule provided for filing of proposed findings and conclu-
sions with the hearing officer and stated that "any proposed 
finding or conclusion not briefed may be regarded as waived."  
17 C.F.R. s 201.16(d).  The second rule provided:  "Any 
person who seeks Commission review of an initial decision by 
a hearing officer shall, within 15 days after service of such 
initial decision, serve and file a petition for Commission 
review containing exceptions thereto indicating specifically 
the findings and conclusions as to which exceptions are taken 
together with supporting reasons for such exceptions. These 
reasons may be stated in summary form.  Any objection to an 
initial decision not saved by written exception filed pursuant 
to this rule will be deemed to have been abandoned and may 
be disregarded."  17 C.F.R. s 217(b).4  Given the plain mean-
ing of these rules, it was not arbitrary for the Commission to 
deem forfeited Canady's statute of limitations defense which 
was neither briefed to the ALJ nor raised in Canady's 

__________
additional evidence was directed to the merits, not to the limitations 
issue.  See JA 582-84.

     3 We note that the only order identified in Canady's petition is, 
appropriately, the April 5, 1999 order.

     4 The SEC has since revised its regulations to require more 
specifically that "[a] defense of res judicata, statute of limitations or 
any other matter constituting an affirmative defense shall be assert-
ed in the answer."  17 C.F.R. 201.220(c) (1999).

exceptions to his decision--nor urged by Canady at any time 
before the Commission's opinion on review.  Cf. Harris v. 
Secretary, United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 126 F.3d 
339, 343, 344 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (finding forfeiture of limitation 
defense where not pleaded in answer as required by Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 8(c)).5

     For the preceding reasons, the petition for review is

                                   Denied.

__________
     5 Canady contends she cannot reasonably be expected to have 
asserted the defense before Johnson issued in June 1996 when she 
had by then already filed her review brief with the Commission.  As 
early as March 1994, however, this court held the statute applicable 
to agency as well as to judicial proceedings.  See 3M Co. v. 
Browner, 17 F.3d 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  There was no reason 
thereafter to doubt that it applied to SEC proceedings.  The only 
issue in Johnson was whether an SEC censure or professional 
suspension is a "civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or 
otherwise" within the meaning of section 2462.  As Canady ac-
knowledges, uncertainty on the issue before Johnson definitively 
resolved it did not prevent counsel in other similar SEC proceed-
ings, including, of course, Johnson itself, from timely asserting a 
section 2462 defense.  See Brief of Appellee at 23.  Further, 
Canady offers no justification for failing to pursue the defense 
between Johnson's issuance on June 21, 1996 and the Commission's 
review decision on April 5, 1999.
