     Before:  Henderson, Randolph, and Garland, Circuit 
Judges.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.

     Garland, Circuit Judge:  In this appeal, Jerome Young 
challenges a criminal sentence he received in 1991 for con-
spiracy to manufacture and distribute phencyclidine (PCP).  
Although Young did not appeal from this sentence when it 
was first imposed, he now seeks a sentence reduction based 
on a subsequent amendment to the United States Sentencing 
Guidelines (U.S.S.G.).  The district court denied Young's 
motion, concluding that the amendment did not affect the 
manner in which Young's sentence was calculated.  We agree 
and therefore affirm.

                                   I

     On December 4, 1989, Young pled guilty to one count of 
conspiring to manufacture and distribute 100 grams or more 
of pure PCP, in violation of 21 U.S.C. ss 846 and 
841(b)(1)(A)(iv), and to one count of using or carrying a 
firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 
18 U.S.C. s 924(c).  Judgment at 1.  Young's initial sentenc-
ing hearing occurred on February 26, 1990.  The presentence 
report (PSR) stated that Young and a co-conspirator were 
engaged in a PCP manufacturing operation, the first stage of 
which had produced a quantity of piperidino- 
cyclohexanecarbonitrile (PCC).1  The report stated--as 
Young had acknowledged during his plea hearing--that at the 
time of his arrest Young was in a van, travelling to a location 
where he could acquire a quantity of phenylmagnesiumchlo-
ride (PMC), a chemical he planned to use to convert the PCC 
into PCP.  1990 PSR p 12;  Change of Plea Tr. at 23, 28-32.  
The police stopped the van, arrested Young, and seized 682 
grams of PCC crystals, a bottle containing 35 grams of pure 
PCP, and a Walther PPK handgun.  According to the presen-
tence report, the 682 grams of PCC, when combined with

Cir. 1986) (describing PCP manufacturing process).

PMC, would have yielded 862 grams of pure PCP.  1990 PSR 
p 13.2

     The presentence report calculated the weight of the con-
trolled substance involved in Young's crime by adding the 35 
grams of pure PCP seized from Young to the 862 grams of 
pure PCP that could have been manufactured from the PCC 
in his possession, producing a total of 897 grams of pure PCP.  
1990 PSR p 22;  see United States v. Young, 89-CR-00307-02, 
slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Dec. 15, 1999).  The Drug Quantity Table 
of Sentencing Guideline s 2D1.1(c) specified a base offense 
level of 34 for a "mixture or substance" containing 300-1000 
grams of pure PCP.  See U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(c) (1989);  id. at 
n.*.  To this, the district court applied a two-level upward 
adjustment for use of a special skill, U.S.S.G. s 3B1.3 (1989), 
and a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of re-
sponsibility, U.S.S.G. s 3E1.1(a) (1989), leaving Young's of-
fense level unchanged at 34.  1990 Sentencing Tr. at 6, 24.  
Based on that offense level, and on the presentence report's 
calculation of Young's criminal history category, the district 
court sentenced Young to 188 months' imprisonment on the 
PCP charge and to a mandatory consecutive term of 60 
months on the firearm charge.  1990 Sentencing Tr. at 24-26.

     Defendant agreed with the presentence report's description 
of his offense conduct, and objected neither to the finding 
that his crime involved 897 grams of pure PCP, nor to the 
conclusion that this produced a base offense level of 34.  1990 
PSR p 18;  id. at 16.  He did object, however, to the two-level 
upward adjustment for use of a special skill, and ultimately 
prevailed on that point on appeal.  See United States v. 

__________
     2 The district court's opinion attributes this calculation to the 
Drug Enforcement Agency chemist who analyzed the seized chemi-
cals.  United States v. Young, 89-CR-00307-02, slip op. at 2 
(D.D.C. Dec. 15, 1999).  We also note that at Young's plea hearing, 
the government stated and Young accepted that the seized PCC, if 
fully processed, would have yielded 831 grams of pure PCP.  The 
record does not reveal why the weight listed in Young's PSR is 
different from that stated during the plea hearing, but Young has 
alleged neither that the PSR's determination was erroneous nor 
that the difference adversely affected his sentence.

Young, 932 F.2d 1510, 1515 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  When the 
district court resentenced Young on December 18, 1991, the 
presentence report again stated that he had been arrested 
with 35 grams of pure PCP and 682 grams of PCC, and that 
the latter would have produced 862 grams of pure PCP.  1991 
PSR p 13.  Based on a combined total of 897 grams of pure 
PCP, the district court again--and again without objection--
assigned Young a base offense level of 34 and applied a two-
level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  
1991 PSR pp  22, 27.  Young was sentenced to 150 months' 
imprisonment on the PCP count and to 60 consecutive months 
on the firearm count.3  He did not file a direct appeal from 
the resentencing.

                                   II

     On November 24, 1998, Young filed a motion to reduce his 
1991 sentence with the same district judge who had sentenced 
him twice before.  The motion was filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
s 3582(c)(2), which permits a court to modify a term of 
imprisonment "in the case of a defendant who has been 
sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subse-
quently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission."  
Young asserted that his sentence should be reduced because 
of Guideline Amendment 484, which, effective November 1, 
1993, altered Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1.  At the 
time of Young's 1991 resentencing,4 Application Note 1 stat-

__________
     3 During his resentencing, Young challenged the criminal history 
category used in his 1990 sentencing proceeding.  Although Young 
had not raised that issue during the appeal from his 1990 sentence, 
the government and district court agreed that Young's criminal 
history category had been miscalculated, and the court used a 
recalculated criminal history category to determine the appropriate 
sentence.

     4 "Under s 1B1.11 of the Guidelines, ... resentencing occurs 
under the version of the Guidelines in effect at the time of resen-
tencing unless such an application would violate the ex post facto 
clause of ... the Constitution."  United States v. Clark, 8 F.3d 839, 
844 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  There are, in any event, no substantive 
differences between the 1989 and 1991 versions of the guidelines 

ed:  " 'Mixture or substance' as used in this guideline has the 
same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. s 841."  U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1, 
comment., n.1 (1991).  Amendment 484, in relevant part, 
added that "[m]ixture or substance does not include materials 
that must be separated from the controlled substance before 
the controlled substance can be used."  U.S.S.G. app. C, 
amend. 484.  The amendment went on to note that "[e]xam-
ples of such materials include the fiberglass in a cocaine/fiber-
glass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, 
and waste water from an illicit laboratory used to manufac-
ture a controlled substance."  Id.

     Young argued to the district court that, pursuant to 
Amendment 484, the weight of the PCC should not have been 
used in determining his offense level.  As support, he cited 
commentary to the amendment which, he contended, clarifies 
that the term "mixture or substance" does not include the 
weight of "chemicals seized before the end of processing 
[that] are not usable in that form because further processing 
must take place before they can be used."  U.S.S.G. app. C, 
amend. 484, comment.  The PCC at issue in this case, he 
claimed, was such a chemical.

     The district court denied Young's motion on two grounds.  
First, the court held that Amendment 484 does not apply to 
PCC because PCC is not a material that, in the amendment's 
words, "must be separated" from PCP before PCP can be 
used.  The commentary's reference to seized chemicals, the 
court concluded, refers to waste byproducts of the manufac-
ture of a controlled substance and not to precursor chemicals 
like PCC.  Young, slip op. at 3-4.

     Second, the district court held that Amendment 484 would 
not reduce Young's sentence in any event, because the court 
had not sentenced Young under the provision altered by 
Amendment 484--namely, Application Note 1 to Guideline 
s 2D1.1.  Rather, Young had been sentenced under Applica-
tion Note 12, which applies when the amount of drugs seized 
does not reflect the scale of the offense.  The court said that, 

__________
applicable to Young's sentence.  From this point forward, all refer-
ences will be to the 1991 version unless otherwise noted.

in applying the latter note, it had based Young's sentence not 
on the amount of PCP or PCC he possessed, but rather on his 
capacity to produce a total of 897 grams of pure PCP.  
Accordingly, whatever changes were wrought by Amendment 
484, they were inapplicable to Young's case.  Young, slip op. 
at 5.

                                   III

     The parties are in accord that the issue presented in this 
case is a legal one, and hence subject to our de novo review.  
See United States v. Drew, 200 F.3d 871, 876 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  
As we conclude that the district court's judgment was correct 
even on that standard, we need not consider whether a more 
deferential standard of review would be appropriate.  See id. 
(describing applicable standards of review in Guidelines 
cases).  Moreover, because we agree with the district court's 
second rationale--that Young was not sentenced under a 
provision affected by Amendment 484--we also need not 
consider whether that amendment excludes the weight of a 
precursor chemical like PCC from the weight of the "mixture 
or substance" to which the Drug Quantity Table of s 2D1.1(c) 
applies.

     The Drug Quantity Table of Guideline s 2D1.1(c) estab-
lishes the base offense level that corresponds to the weight 
and kind of controlled substance involved in a defendant's 
offense.  As provided in the guideline, "[u]nless otherwise 
specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the 
table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance 
containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance."  
U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(c), n.*.  The guideline further provides that 
"[i]n the case of a mixture or substance containing PCP," the 
court should "use the offense level determined by the entire 
weight of the mixture or substance, or the offense level 
determined by the weight of the [pure] PCP ..., whichever is 
greater."  Id. (emphasis added).

     Prior to its 1993 amendment, s 2D1.1 did not define "mix-
ture or substance," other than to state, in Application Note 1, 

that the term "has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. s 841."  
That statute establishes penalties for crimes involving "mix-
ture[s] or substance[s]" containing specified narcotics, but 
also does not define the term.  The effect of Amendment 484 
is to clarify that, in using the Drug Quantity Table, the 
sentencing court is to exclude from the weight of the "mixture 
or substance" any "materials that must be separated from the 
controlled substance before the controlled substance can be 
used."  U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 484.  Hence, if the court had 
sentenced Young based on the weight of a mixture containing 
both PCP and PCC, and in doing so had included the weight 
of the PCC, it would be necessary to determine whether PCC 
is the kind of material whose exclusion is required by Amend-
ment 484.

     But it is clear from both the district court's statements and 
the presentence report that the court did not sentence Young 
based on the weight of a mixture containing both PCP and 
PCC.  Rather, he was sentenced based on the weight of a 
quantity of pure PCP.  See Young, slip op. at 2;  1991 PSR 
p 13.  That quantity consisted of the 35 grams of pure PCP 
seized at the time of his arrest, plus the 862 grams of pure 
PCP that could have been produced from the amount of PCC 
also in Young's possession.  The resulting total of 897 grams 
of pure PCP corresponds to an offense level of 34, as set forth 
in the Drug Quantity Table.  See s 2D1.1(c)(5) (specifying 
offense level of 34 for offense involving 300-1000 grams of 
pure PCP).

     As the district court stated, and as the defendant himself 
conceded below, the court calculated the amount of pure PCP 
involved in Young's offense not by using Application Note 1 to 
s 2D1.1, but rather by using Application Note 12.  Young, 
slip op. at 5 ("[T]he use of Note 12 was the basis of Young's 
sentence calculation in this case.");  Def.'s Resp. to Gov't's 
Opp'n to Mot. to Modify Sentence at 2 ("[W]hen this Court 
initially sentenced the defendant, it determined his offense 
level by approximating the quantity of PCP that could be 
produced from the 682 grams of precursor chemical, 

PCC....  See s 2D1.1, Application Note 12.").  Under that 
note, "[i]f the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the 
offense," the court is directed to use Application Note 2 to 
s 2D1.4.  Application Note 2, in turn, instructs the court to 
"approximate the quantity of the controlled substance," and 
provides that, in doing so, the court "may consider, for 
example, ... the size or capability of any laboratory in-
volved."  U.S.S.G. s 2D1.4, comment., n.2.

     The undisputed facts of this case established that the 
amount of pure PCP seized from Young, 35 grams, did not 
reflect the scale of the offense to which he pled guilty:  
conspiracy to manufacture and distribute 100 grams or more 
of pure PCP.  See Judgment at 1.  The evidence--which 
included Young's acknowledgment that he had been en route 
to obtain the chemicals needed to convert the PCC he had on 
hand into PCP, see Change of Plea Tr. at 23--established 
that Young was conspiring to manufacture considerably more 
than those 35 grams.  Accordingly, as the district court later 
explained, it applied Application Note 12 and considered the 
capability of Young's operation, which in this case was evi-
denced by the amount of PCC found in his possession.  See 
Young, slip op. at 2, 5.  The court used that amount to 
approximate the quantity of the controlled substance Young 
was conspiring to manufacture:  pure PCP.  And it was that 
quantity--the quantity of pure PCP involved--that dictated a 
base offense level of 34.  See U.S.S.G. s 2D1.1(c)(5) & n.*.

     As this recitation makes clear, the district court did not 
include the weight of the PCC in the weight of the "mixture 
or substance" that was used to determine Young's sentence.  
Hence, neither Application Note 1 nor Amendment 484 ap-
plies.  Instead, employing Application Notes 12 and 2, the 
court used the amount of PCC seized from Young as evidence 
of the amount of pure PCP involved in Young's manufactur-
ing conspiracy.5  Courts may rely on the amount of precursor

U.S.S.G. s 2D1.4, comment., n.2.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Smith, 240 F.3d 927, 930-31 (11th Cir. 2001);  United States 
v. Becker, 230 F.3d 1224, 1234-36 (10th Cir. 2000);  United 
States v. Allison, 63 F.3d 350, 352-53 (5th Cir. 1995);  United 
States v. Basinger, 60 F.3d 1400, 1409-10 (9th Cir. 1995);  
United States v. Evans, 891 F.2d 686, 687-88 (8th Cir. 1989).  
Indeed, Application Note 2's reference to "the size or capabil-
ity of any laboratory involved" is listed merely as an "exam-
ple" of the kind of evidence a court may consider in determin-
ing the amount of the controlled substance that was the 
object of an incomplete conspiracy.  U.S.S.G. s 2D1.4, com-
ment., n. 2.6  As we have previously held, testimony about a 
conspirator's intentions alone, even without physical evidence, 
may be sufficient to establish the amount of drugs contem-
plated as the object of a conspiracy.  See United States v. 
Lam Kwong-Wah, 924 F.2d 298, 305-06 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 
1991).  Where there is physical evidence, the case is that 
much stronger.

quantity of PCP that could be produced from 682 grams of PCC.");  
id. at 5 ("Young could have easily produced 862 grams of pure PCP 
with the PCC crystals he had already made once he obtained the 
necessary [PMC]....  Young's production capability was the basis 
of his sentence.");  see also Young Br. at 12-13 (conceding that "the 
district court did not directly use the weight of the PCC in 
determining [Young's] offense level," but that the weight of PCC 
was used to determine the quantity of pure PCP "supposedly 
capable of being produced from the PCC").

     6 In 1991, Note 2 was an application note to s 2D1.4, which 
provided that "if a defendant is convicted of a conspiracy ... to 
commit any offense involving a controlled substance, the offense 
level shall be the same as if the object of the conspiracy ... had 
been completed."  U.S.S.G. s 2D1.4.  The Sentencing Commission 
deleted s 2D1.4 in 1992, and moved the relevant text of Note 2 to 
Application Note 12 of s 2D1.1.  See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 447;  
United States v. Ynfante, 78 F.3d 677, 680-81 (D.C. Cir. 1996) 
(holding that amended Note 12 applies to choate as well as inchoate 
offenses).

     In sum, the district court did not include the seized PCC in 
determining the weight of a "mixture or substance" under 
Application Note 1 to s 2D1.1, but instead used the PCC as 
evidence to calculate the weight of pure PCP that was the 
object of Young's conspiracy, as prescribed by Application 
Note 12 to s 2D1.1 and Application Note 2 to s 2D1.4.  As 
defendant conceded at oral argument, the latter notes were 
unaffected by Amendment 484.  See Allison, 63 F.3d at 353 
(holding that "Amendment 484 does not speak to the situation 
in which the district court is sentencing the defendant based 
on the size and capability of the laboratory involved").  For 
that reason, Young's motion to reduce his sentence pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. s 3582(c) must fail.  That statute provides, in 
relevant part, that a court "may not modify a term of 
imprisonment once it has been imposed[,] except that" the 
court may reduce a prison term "in the case of a defendant 
who has been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that 
has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commis-
sion ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable 
policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission."  18 
U.S.C. s 3582(c) (emphasis added).  To implement that provi-
sion, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Guideline 
s 1B1.10, which contains a list of guideline amendments and 
states that "[i]f none of the amendments listed ... is applica-
ble, a reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment 
under 18 U.S.C. s 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with this policy 
statement and thus is not authorized."  U.S.S.G. s 1B1.10(a), 
p.s. (2000).  Although Amendment 484 is included in the list 
of amendments, because the amendment is not applicable to 
Young's case, 18 U.S.C. s 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a 
reduction in his sentence.

                                              IV

     Young raises a number of additional challenges to his 
sentence, based not on Amendment 484 but on asserted 
deficiencies in the court's application of unamended provisions 
of s 2D1.1 and s 2D1.4.7  In light of the foregoing, it is plain 

__________
     7 The principal deficiency Young asserts is that the district court 
should have calculated the weight of PCP involved in his offense by 

that those challenges cannot succeed either.  As the Sentenc-
ing Commission stated in its commentary to s 1B1.10, when 
adjudicating a motion based on s 3582(c)(2), all "guideline 
application decisions remain unaffected" other than those 
subject to the listed amendments.  U.S.S.G. s 1B1.10, p.s., 
comment., n.2 (2000);  see United States v. Bravo, 203 F.3d 
778, 780-81 (11th Cir. 2000);  United States v. Wyatt, 115 F.3d 
606, 609 (8th Cir. 1997).  Because Young does not allege that 
his additional challenges are grounded upon Amendment 484, 
or upon any other amendment to the Guidelines, we have no 
cause to consider them further.
