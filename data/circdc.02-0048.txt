     Before:  Sentelle and Rogers, Circuit Judges, and 
Williams, Senior Circuit Judge.

     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers.

     Rogers, Circuit Judge:  El Conejo Americano of Texas, Inc. 
and its officers, Raymond D. Sena and his son, Daniel Sena, 
(collectively "El Conejo") petition for review of the July 28, 
2000 decision of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adminis-
tration ("FMCSA"), denying their application for registration 
as a motor common carrier of passengers pursuant to 49 
U.S.C. s 13902.  We deny the petition.

     El Conejo contends that the FMCSA's determination that 
it and its officers are unfit ignores their past compliance with 
the safety fitness rating methodology approved by this court 
and is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial 
evidence.  Specifically, referencing Department of Transpor-
tation v. ICC, 733 F.2d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1984), and Wilkett v. 
ICC, 710 F.2d 861 (D.C. Cir. 1983), El Conejo maintains that 
the standards applied by the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion ("ICC") continue to govern and that the FMCSA failed 
to apply them.  This contention raises the threshold question 
whether the FMCSA is bound by the decisions of its prede-
cessor agency, the ICC.  The FMCSA does not address this 
point in its brief, maintaining instead that "[t]he statute [49 
U.S.C. s 13902] does not confine examination of a registration 
application to an applicant's fitness ratings or restrict the 
agency's consideration to matters presented by the appli-
cant."  Resp't's Br. at 15.  Ultimately, we conclude that it is 
unnecessary to resolve the binding nature of ICC decisions in 
this appeal.

     El Conejo's contention depends on the following reasoning.  
Prior to Congress's enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 
1995, Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (1995) (codified as 
amended in scattered sections of 49 U.S.C.), the ICC con-
trolled the granting of certificates authorizing the provision of 
transportation as a motor common carrier, pursuant to 49 
U.S.C. s 10922(b)(1) (repealed 1995), and formulated a five-
factor test for evaluating the extent to which past safety 

violations could preclude a motor carrier license.  Under the 
five-factor test, the ICC considered:

     (1) [t]he nature and extent of ... [the carrier's] past 
     violations, (2) the mitigating circumstances surrounding 
     the violations, (3) whether the carrier's conduct repre-
     sents a flagrant and persistent disregard of [the] Com-
     mission's rules and regulations, (4) whether it has made 
     sincere efforts to correct its past mistakes, and (5) 
     whether the applicant is willing and able to comport in 
     the future with the statute and the applicable rules and 
     regulations thereunder.
     
Dep't of Transp., 733 F.2d at 110 (quoting Curtis, Inc. v. ICC, 
662 F.2d 680, 687-88 (10th Cir. 1981) (quoting Associated 
Transp., Inc., Extension-TVA Plant, 125 M.C.C. 69, 73 
(1976))).  In the ICC Termination Act, Congress abolished 
the ICC and transferred its authority to certify motor com-
mon carriers to the Department of Transportation.  See Pub. 
L. No. 104-88, ss 101, 103, 109 Stat. at 804, 880-84.  In so 
doing, Congress replaced s 10922, the ICC's motor carrier 
certifying provision, with s 13902, a substantially similar 
provision, under which the Department of Transportation 
oversees the registration of motor carriers.  See id. s 103, 
109 Stat. at 880-84.  The ICC Termination Act, however, also 
included a savings provision, which provided that the ICC's 
legal documents, orders, determinations, rules, and regula-
tions "shall continue in effect according to their terms until 
modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked in 
accordance with law by ... an[ ] authorized official, a court of 
competent jurisdiction, or operation of law."  Id. s 204, 109 
Stat. at 941-93.  The Department of Transportation, acting 
through the Federal Highway Administration, recognized, 
pursuant to this savings provision, the continuing legal vitali-
ty of ICC decisions;  it gave public notice that it interpreted 
the savings provision to cover "all legal documents of the ICC 
that were issued or granted by an official authorized to effect 

such document...."  Continuation of the Effectiveness of 
Interstate Commerce Commission Legal Documents, 61 Fed. 
Reg. 14,372 (1996);  see also Registration of For-hire Motor 
Carriers, Property Brokers, and Freight Forwarders, 63 Fed. 
Reg. 7,362, 7,363 (1998);  General Jurisdiction over Freight 
Forwarder Service, 62 Fed. Reg. 4,096, 4,097 (1997).  While 
the entity responsible for overseeing motor carrier safety 
functions has shifted within the Department,1 there is no 
indication that any of these entities has revised or repudiated 
ICC decisions on motor carrier registration.

     Because of the substantial similarity between the statutory 
registration provisions of the ICC and its successor and the 
continuing vitality of ICC decisions, El Conejo, in effect, 
would have the court hold that the FMCSA could not modify, 
without explicit explanation, the ICC's decisions setting forth 
a five-factor test for the consideration of past violations in 
granting motor carrier registration.  Cf. Atchison, Topeka & 
Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, 412 U.S. 800, 808 
(1973);  Brusco Tug & Barge Co. v. NLRB, 247 F.3d 273, 278 
(D.C. Cir. 2001).  The court need not resolve this issue now, 
however.  Assuming that the FMCSA is bound by ICC 
decisions interpreting its substantially similar registration 
provision and should have applied the ICC's five-factor test 
does not change the result in this appeal.

     The court must uphold the FMCSA's decision unless it is 
"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not 
in accordance with law."  5 U.S.C. s 706(2)(A).  "[I]f satisfied 
that the agency has taken a hard look at the issues with the 

__________
     1  Initially, the Federal Highway Administration, in the Depart-
ment of Transportation, had the duty to oversee motor carrier 
safety;  this duty was briefly shifted to the Office of Motor Carrier 
Safety in the Department in 1999, Organization and Delegation of 
Powers and Duties;  Recission of Delegation to the Administrator, 
Federal Highway Administration and Redelegation to Director, 
Office of Motor Carrier Safety, 64 Fed. Reg. 56,270 (1999).  Shortly 
thereafter, Congress established the FMCSA as an administration 
within the Department and shifted motor carrier safety functions to 
it.  Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 
106-159, s 101, 113 Stat. 1748, 1750-52 (1999).

use of reasons and standards, the court will uphold its find-
ings, though of less than ideal clarity, if the agency's path 
may reasonably be discerned...."  Hall v. McLaughlin, 864 
F.2d 868, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting Greater Boston Televi-
sion Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (D.C. Cir. 1970)).  
Although the FMCSA did not explicitly articulate the five-
factor test, it considered each of its factors in concluding that 
El Conejo did not meet the statutory standard for motor 
carrier registration.  As to the first and third factors, the 
FMCSA took into account State court findings of Mr. Ray-
mond Sena's and El Conejo's violations of a stipulation en-
tered into with the New Mexico Attorney General in a 
proceeding before the New Mexico Public Safety Commission 
with regard to Mr. Raymond Sena's operation of another bus 
company.  It also had a report from its field staff regarding 
El Conejo's limited cooperation in the inspection of its equip-
ment, evidence provided by the New Mexico Attorney Gener-
al's office of several safety violations that occurred under the 
management of Mr. Raymond Sena in the operation of anoth-
er bus company, as well as protests from the general public.  
As to the remaining factors, the FMCSA had affidavits 
submitted by El Conejo attempting to mitigate this evidence 
of past safety violations.  FMCSA also evaluated the fact that 
Mr. Raymond Sena's son, Daniel Sena, was president of El 
Conejo, concluding that Mr. Raymond Sena was actually in 
charge of the daily operations of El Conejo.  In addition, 
FMCSA considered El Conejo's predecessor's "Satisfactory" 
safety rating and El Conejo's descriptions of its future safety 
policies as evidence of future compliance.  Further, in deny-
ing the application, the FMCSA specifically found "evidence 
of [Mr. Raymond Sena's] general disregard for safety re-
quirements" and an absence of "the requisite intent and 
ability" to maintain compliance with safety standards notwith-
standing "finely worded statements of policy and procedure 
put forward on their behalf."  FMCSA Order at 5, 9 (July 28, 
2000).

     Thus, although the FMCSA did not articulate the five-
factor test, it did adhere to it.  Indeed, rather than contend 
that the FMCSA's failure to articulate the five-factor test was 
arbitrary and capricious despite its substantive adherence to 

the test, El Conejo instead seeks to have this court reweigh 
the evidence.  El Conejo had an opportunity to have the 
evidence reweighed in an administrative appeal, see 49 C.F.R. 
s 365.111, but did not pursue such an appeal.  The question 
before the court is whether FMCSA's conclusion was reason-
able, as the court's role is not to reweigh the evidence.  See 
Sec'y of Labor v. Keystone Coal Mining Corp., 151 F.3d 1096, 
1104 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  see also Throckmorton v. Nat'l Transp. 
Safety Bd., 963 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  Based on the 
evidence before it, the FMCSA reasonably concluded that El 
Conejo would not comply with safety fitness standards in the 
future in light of evidence of its inability to comply with the 
stipulation it entered into with the New Mexico Attorney 
General, its failure to comply with the tenor of the agency's 
inspection order, and numerous past safety violations.

     El Conejo's remaining contentions are meritless.  The plain 
terms of s 13902 contemplate the consideration of evidence 
beyond past compliance with the safety fitness rating method-
ology under s 31144.  See 49 U.S.C. s 13902(a).  The ICC's 
five-part test, approved by the court, see Wilkett, 710 F.2d at 
864-65, confirms this.  Further, FMCSA's procedures were 
adequate, see, e.g., Am. Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight 
Serv., 397 U.S. 532, 538-39 (1970);  Dist. No. 1, Pac. Coast 
Dist., Marine Eng'rs Beneficial Ass'n, 215 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. 
Cir. 2000);  Fried v. Hinson, 78 F.3d 688, 690-91 (D.C. Cir. 
1996);  Crawford v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 50 F.3d 46, 49 (D.C. 
Cir. 1995), and any shortcomings did not rise to the constitu-
tional level.  See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp v. LTV Corp., 
496 U.S. 633, 653-56 (1990).  Finally, as noted, ample evi-
dence supported the FMCSA's decision.

     Accordingly, we deny the petition.
