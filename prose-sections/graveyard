We will keep k=1 and analyze various K's.
We will also analyze situations with a few hot potatos and a few chaotic
senators.
We won't analyze the interesting case of more diverse judge rankings (e.g.

(\*\*) compare with median-of-medians selection.

        Every layer of "taking majorities" compounds
        the risk of "unproportional" results.  TEMPORAL GERRYMANDERING

    I understand **gerrymandering** as the failure of (linearity and hence)
associativity of the "majority operation".  To say that "most rows of a
chessboard each have most of their cells occupied" is quite different from
saying that "most of the board's cells are occupied".  Just imagine a 5-by-5
region!

    APPROPRIATIONS PROCEDURE

        This procedure results in a budget, that is, a list of items to fund,
        each annotated with the dollar amount allotted and with rules for how
        the funds may be spent.  I imagine it as augmenting House Rules, not
        the US Constitution.

    (A) The House decides on a coarse-grained menu of, say, 1000 items to fund.
        Items might be executive departments, tax cuts, specific programs, etc.
    (B) Use the BINARY ALLOCATION PROCEDURE to set an allocated dollar figure
        for each item.  (As a matter of logistics, parallelize over the items).
    (C) Representatives may propose revisions to the allocations, revisions
        that must be promptly voted on.  Revisions that merely specify
        fine-grained constraints within a menu item are accepted when a simple
        majority concurs.  Other revisions require a (3/5)ths majority.  At the
        end of 7 days, the allocation passes the House.




    SENATE VOTING PROCEDURE

        This procedure decides on a bill.  No bill shall pass to the
        President's desk without having been passed by the House and
        *afterward* by this procedure.  This procedure does not apply to the
        Senate's extraordinary activities such as advice-and-consent,
        impeachment trials, veto overrides, constitutional amendments,
        admission of States to the Union, etc.

    (A) The Senators vote with simple yeas and nays.  Should nays outnumber
        yeas, the bill fails.  The Vice President breaks ties.
    (B) Should the bill pass step (A), any F=(2/5)ths of Senators may, by
        spending tokens, initiate a "neofilibuster".  Here's what happens:
        (B.a) The objectors initiate by spending O=2(**) tokens in sum.
        (B.b) The supporters may choose to spend S=3(**) tokens in sum;
              unless they do so, the bill fails.
        (B.c) After D=7(**) days of deliberation shall promptly follow...
        (B.d) ...the Weighted Vote Procedure to determine passage of the bill.
    (C) If no "neofilibuster" occurs, the bill passes.

    The Congress may by a 3/5s unweighted majority in each Chamber, subject to
    the ordinary veto and veto-override procedures, alter the parameters O,S,D
    marked above by (**).

    Note the relation S/(O+S) = 3/5.
