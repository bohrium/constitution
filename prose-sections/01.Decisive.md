## Toward Decisive Designs

### STALLING

Legislators "stall" in many ways. For example,

-   Representatives (perhaps to wrest concessions from leadership when their
    own party has a thin majority) may fail to agree by majority vote on a Speaker.

-   Senators (perhaps in anticipation of an upcoming presidential election) may
    reject a technically excellent Supreme Court nominee, causing a long vacancy
    in that Court.

-   Members of Congress may engage in partisan deadlock, stranding federal
    bureaucracies without a clear budget.

-   State legislators (perhaps to avoid the acute unpopularity of a "no" vote)
    may fail ever to schedule a vote on a proposed amendment, leaving the
    latter's ratification open for decades.

Such stalling leads to:

-   more time to deliberate towards a wise choice

-   irregular disruptions to regular governance

-   vast power for those who control procedure

**Limited government.**
Arguably such "dysfunction" is actually function.  We Americans prefer to
distribute power across both geographic scales (*federalism*) and
across kinds of power (*separation of powers*).  Thus, the same strictures that
hobble national legislation also protect certain minorities (those correlated
with state geography) from majority oppression.  And yet, despite my sympathy
for limitations on government, I regard the above four examples of stalling as
procedural pathologies.

**Decisive procedures.**
To prevent stalling, we ought to adopt decision making procedures that
necessarily terminate with a reasonable decision, i.e., with an answer to the
fundamental question we intend the procedure to address.  Call such procedures
*decisive*.

It's easy enough to fix the ratification of amendments.  The question here is:
"*Should this amendment become supreme law?*"  The possible answers are `yes`
or `no`.  To get a decisive ratification procedure, we may simply impose a time
limit.

Likewise, the House must answer, "*Who should be Speaker of the House?*".  The
possible answers are a menu of candidates gotten from nominations by
Representatives.  Instead of asking for a majority, the House could adopt
plurality voting, approval voting, ranked choice voting, two-round voting, or
any other procedure that (barring the improbable case of ties) selects a unique
candidate after a bounded number of voting rounds.

### WHITTLING FOR THE SUPREME COURT

For appointment of Justices, the fundamental question might seem to be "*Should this
particular nominee join the Court?*" --- but I regard that as an
implementation-specific sub-question of this more fundamental question: "*Who
should join the Court?*".  Majority voting to confirm a particular nominee,
even with a time limit, fails to be a decisive procedure, since the Senate
might keep rejecting nominees as its members play a game of chicken, each
Senator unwilling to budge in the face of the time limit.

I propose instead to revise the Court-filling procedure into something like an
election so that certainly *someone* will win:

    BASIC WHITTLING PROCEDURE.

        This procedure narrows a list of 101 candidates to size 1 by letting
        each of 100 Senators eliminate one candidate.

    (A) We are given a list with 101 distinct entries, each a candidate.
    (B) Randomly sequence the 100 Senators.  Announce this sequence.
    (C) Each Senator in sequence eliminates one list entry (or else abstains).
    (D) Select as the finalist the 1 judge who remains listed.  In case
        multiple judges remain, the Vice President shall break ties.

In case `K=101` candidates seems too many, or in case `k=1` finalist seems too
few, we can adapt the procedure.  The idea is to simulate a menu of `>100`
candidates by duplicating candidates in the list.  Thus:

    WHITTLING PROCEDURE.

        This procedure narrows a list of K candidates to k finalists by letting
        each of N Senators eliminate one "candidate-with-multiplicity".

    (A) Prepare a list whose every entry names one of the K candidates.  It
        shall have a least number L of entries that exceeds N by at least
        L(k-1)/K.  The Vice President shall divide the entries
        among the candidates as equally as may be.
    (B) Randomly sequence the N many Senators.  Announce this sequence.
    (C) Each Senator in sequence eliminates one list entry (or else abstains).
    (D) Select as finalists the k candidates who remain listed.  In case more
        than k candidates remain listed, the Vice President shall break ties.

That excess `floor(1+N(k-1)/K)` ensures that at least `k` candidates remain
listed by step (D), no matter how Senators vote.  Observe that

    floor(L/K) <= (N + (floor(1+L(k-1)/K)))/K <= ceil(L/K)

  TODO: DETERMINE AVG NUMBER OF LIST ENTRIES PER CANDIDATE (NOT JUST N/K)

**Setting K and k.**
For practicality and other reasons discussed in subsequent sections, I prefer
`K=25` and `k=2`.

*Is `K=25` impractically many candidates to consider?*  I find it orienting to
recall that Senators in principle read thousands of pages per year in close
detail --- but that in practice their aids and their party leadership share
this burden.  I think that compiling and contemplating dossiers on the
characters, experiences, and jurisprudential philosophies of each of `K=25`
judges is a much lesser burden.

Why set `k=2` instead of `k=1`?
With `k=2`, the Senate may thoroughly interview and decide between multiple
finalists, thus allowing recovery even if a totally unqualified candidate slips
through.  It could be that *both* finalists are totally unqualified; but if
these finalists --- in a sense the least objectionable `8%`(=2/25) of a
seniority-based sample of the highest ranking `21%`(=179/861) of the country's
non-Justice judges --- harbor multiple incompetent judges, then we have bigger
problems to worry about.

**Whittling for the Supreme Court.**
Whittling fits into our overall SCOTUS amendment like this:

    APPROVE-AFTER-WHITTLING PROCEDURE.

        This procedure fills a vacancy on the Supreme Court.  It shall conclude
        at most T=60 days after a vacancy arises.

    (A) Select from the judges on the Appellate courts those K=25 judges of the
        most median seniority, not counting those who opt out.
    (B) Narrow that list to k=2 finalists via the Whittling Procedure.
    (C) Each Senator votes for any subset of the k=2 finalists.  The finalist
        with the most votes becomes the newest Justice.

Step `(A)` prepares the menu of `K` candidates for the Senate to whittle.  Taking
judges of median seniority is simply one of many ways to prepare this menu so
that every judge gets about the same chance-per-career of being in the menu.

For step `(A)`, we count vacant seats as most junior when ranking by seniority.
Otherwise, the President or setters of the Senate's schedule might influence
the result by choosing how many judges to confirm shortly before step `(A)`
begins.  Likewise, whether or not a judge opts out shall not change the numeric
ranks given to the other judges.

In step `(C)` we use "approval voting" instead of "plurality voting" so as to
avoid third-candidate spoiler effects.  This consideration is relevant only
when `k>=3`.

### BONUS HALF-BAKED THOUGHTS ON BUDGETS and FILIBUSTERS

Above, we shifted our view about the fundamental question a SCOTUS appointment
procedure ought to answer.  This shift helped us craft a decisive procedure.
We now treat budgeting and filibusters in the same spirit.
**I do not advocate this section's ideas**; I write them to illustrate and inspire
ways of thinking about decisive procedures.

**Budgets and agreeing on numbers.**
For example, to craft a budget we might ask not "*Is this proposed budget
 acceptable?*" but instead "*Is the current allocation for this budget item too
low or too high?*".  Here's a sketch of such a procedure.  We focus on the
House since that chamber originates revenue (and by convention also
appropriations) bills:

    BINARY ALLOCATION PROCEDURE

        This procedure determines a dollar figure between zero dollars and a
        quadrillion dollars.  For instance, the procedure may be
        interpreted as total military spending.  I imagine it as augmenting
        House Rules, not the US Constitution.

    (A) Determine a ceiling $X by tentatively setting $X=$1 and then repeating:
        (A.a) Go to step (B) with the consent of 3/5s of the House.
        (A.b) Multiply X by 10.  Repeat (A.a,A.b), but not more than 15 times.
    (B) Determine an interval, tentatively set to [$0, $X], by repeating:
        (B.a) Go to step (C) with the consent of 3/5s of the House.
        (B.b) Halve the current interval [$L, $H] to [$L, $M] and [$M, $H].
        (B.c) The House shall select between [$L, $M] and [$M, $H] by simple
              majority vote.  This shall become the new interval.
        (B.d) Repeat (B.a,B.b,B.c,B.d), 30 times total.
    (C) If the interval is [$L, $H], then the final dollar figure is $L.

For example, to create a budget (that is, a list of items to fund,
each annotated with the dollar amount allotted and with rules for how
the funds may be spent), the House might first agree on a coarse-grained menu of, say, 1000 items to fund.  Items might be executive departments, specific programs, etc.
Second, the House would for each item use the BINARY ALLOCATION PROCEDURE to 
agree on that item's funding.  (As a matter of logistics, parallelize over the items).
Finally, the House would propose and promptly vote on revisions to the allocations,
accepting intra-item revisions by simple majorities and inter-item revisions
by 3/5s majorities.
After a fixed number of days, whatever allocations pass the House.

One may adapt the above into a decisive procedure to involve the Senate, too.
However, getting the House and Senate to agree seems to require a Constitutional
Amendment, not just new House and Senate rules.

**Filibusters and intensity.**
*What do filibusters do?*  They attempt to answer the question, "*Is opposition to
this bill so intense as to merit overriding a thin majority of yeas?*".
However, the actual filibuster process weighs merely *apparent* intensity.  We
want instead to elicit calibrated estimates of earnestly felt
intensity.  So let's revise the implementation question to "*Among this palette
of bills, which few bills have opposition so intense as to merit overriding a
thin majority of yeas?*"  This suggests a system that allots to each Senator a
limited budget of "filibuster tokens"; the Senator must choose wisely which
votes to use them on: once used, a token disappears.  In this way we *allow but
penalize* extremism.

We let each token amplify a vote --- say, from
counting as one "yea" or "nay" to two --- rather than obstruct a majority
entirely.  Gangs of Senators would have to spend multiple tokens to obstruct
anything but a nearly-tied majority.

    WEIGHTED VOTE PROCEDURE

    (A) Each regularly elected Senator receives T=2 tokens at the start of their 6-year
        term.  Senators appointed to fill a vacancy inherit their predecessor's tokens.  A
        Senator's tokens expire at the end of their term.

    (B) A "weighted vote" occurs as follows.  Each Senator who holds at least
        one token may choose to "amplify their vote".  Doing so decreases the
        number of tokens they hold by one; it also promotes their vote to count
        as W=2 votes.  The outcome is determined by whether weighted yeas
        outnumber weighted nays.  The Vice President breaks ties.

    Tokens spent on vetoed legislation are not returned.

Now, what new behaviors might this "token system" incentivize?  For example,
what if a thin majority rudely introduces replicas of an obstructed bill,
depleting the opposition's tokens until they can no longer afford to obstruct?
The *threatened* passage of a thin-majority bills is itself something to do
only sparingly.  So let's make that cost tokens, too.

So here's how the Senate would decide on a bill.
First, the Senators vote with simple yeas and nays.
Should nays outnumber yeas, the bill fails (VP breaks ties).
Otherwise, any 2/5s of Senators may initiate a 
"neofilibuster" by spending `O=2` tokens in sum.  The bill fails
unless the supporters choose to spend `S=3` tokens in sum (that `S/(S+O)=3/5` is deliberate).
If the bill still hasn't failed, then after a
fixed number of days of deliberation, the Senate uses
the WEIGHTED VOTE PROCEDURE to determine passage of the bill.
If no "neofilibuster" occurs, the bill passes.

The Weighted Voting Procedure is a simplified or "truncated" form of "quadratic
voting".  In certain extreme cases (if there is a large, fixed menu of bills
and if each Senator is substantively uncertain about the other Senators'
preferences, and if these uncertainties are uncorrelated and symmetric with
respect to both bills and Senators), quadratic voting maximizes utility while
our truncated version doesn't.  But those extreme cases do not plausibly model
the Senate.
