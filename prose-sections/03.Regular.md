## Toward Regular Designs

Is the 10th Justice packing?

### Term limits and backups

    REVOLVING DOOR PROCEDURE.

        This procedure maintains a queue of 10 Supreme Court Justices.  The
        most junior Justice hears cases, deliberates, and may write opinions;
        but they may not vote except to break ties.  The most junior Justice
        thus votes only in the event of a vacancy or recusal.

    (A) On May 1 of each odd year, the most senior Justice retires.
    (B) Whenever a vacancy arises, including by step (A), fill that vacancy via
        the Approve-after-Whittling Procedure.

### Presidential influence

The amendment strips the President of immediate influence over Supreme Court
appointments.  However, each President strongly affects future Supreme Court
appointments through their appointments to the Appellate Courts.  This counters
the risk that the Supreme Court gets packed with Justices whose rulings favor
an expansively powerful Senate and a limited, vestigial Presidency.

Here are statistics to refine our sense of scale.  Typical presidents each year
rotate about `4%` to `8%` of the Appellate Courts' seats.  Here are the postwar
presidents together with their number of appointments to the appeals courts.

    Carter        4       56:132 (*)      11%         39:132          7%
    Reagan        8       83:168           6%         65:168          5%
    Bush Sr.      4       42:179           6%         37:179          5%
    Clinton       8       66:179           5%         66:179          5%
    Bush Jr.      8       63:179           4%         63:179          4%
    Obama         8       55:179           4%         55:179          4%
    Trump         4       54:179           8%         54:179          8%
    Biden         2       11:179           3%         11:179          3%

    (*) I think it was this expansion of the courts, undiluted by a double
        term, that allowed Carter to reset so many seats per year of his term.

    Note: by the number of `rotations` we mean the number of appointees minus
          *half* of the seat expansion during the term.  This helps us discount
          for the effect of court expansion.

    Note: we sum 12 regional appeals courts with the federal appeals court;
          and to count seats we use the president's end of term.  There may
          be off-by-one errors in this end-of-term seat-number timing.

    Note: presidents may fill the same seat multiple times.  TODO!

(TODO : consider practical allowances for appeals courts expansion?)

Thus, we might expect presidents to rotate between 16% and 64% of the seats.
All listed presidents (except Biden) have appointed between 12% and 64%.

Does this give some one former President too much lasting power?  If they
happen to have been the appointer of almost all the K=30 median seniority
judges?

Vacant seats count as most junior.  Judges may opt out, in which case their
seats still count according to their seniority.

### Changing parameters

##### _TRANSIENT STAGE_

##### _PARAMETER TUNING

Congress may expand the courts (to relieve ever-growing case burdens).  Such
changes of parameters lie somewhere between a Constitutional Amendment and
ordinary law.  So let's use an intermediate criterion for passage:

    The Congress may by a 3/5ths unweighted majority in each Chamber, subject
    to the ordinary veto and veto-override procedures, alter the following
    numeric parameters: T, K, k, N, ...

We use `3/5` instead of `1/2` so as not to tempt a thin majority toward packing
the Appellate Courts and thus toward shifting future Supreme Court
appointments.  We further counter this temptation by adding a time delay:

    When appointing Justices to the Supreme Court: each additional seat on the
    Appellate Courts shall, 12 years after its addition and no earlier, be
    considered in seniority computations and be eligible for inclusion in lists
    of candidates.

### Bonus thought on our amendment process

I propose:

    The Congress, with the agreement of 2/3s of both its Chambers, shall
    propose Amendments to this Constitution for consideration by the People.
    Thereupon a Vote on the Amendment shall be held within 4 years in each
    State; and unless in 1/4 of the States the Nays exceed the Yeas, the
    Amendment shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this
    Constitution.

    Unless 1/4 of all individual votes purposes as part of this Constitution.

    But no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage
    in the Senate.

    In every 25th year each State shall elect a number of Amenders equal to the
    whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be
    entitled in the Congress.  But no
    Senator or Representative, or person holding an Office of Trust or Profit
    under the United States shall be appointed an Amender.

And in every 25th year a College oConvention shall be held
with each State sending as many delegates as it has Representatives and
Senators in Congress.  This College of Amendment shall within 2 years recommend
amendments for consideration by the States.
