## Toward Antipartisan Designs

### Gerrymandering

        Every layer of "taking majorities" compounds
        the risk of "unproportional" results.  TEMPORAL GERRYMANDERING

I understand **gerrymandering** as the failure of (linearity and hence)
associativity of the "majority operation".  To say that "most rows of a
chessboard each have most of their cells occupied" is quite different from
saying that "most of the board's cells are occupied".  Just imagine a 5-by-5
region!  Gerrymandering appears in government when decisions are made by
majorities of majorities.(\*\*)  For example, it is a majority of Electors that
chooses the President; each Elector follows their state's popular majority.
Or, to swap time for space: it is a majority of Justices that decides a case
before the Supreme Court; each Justice (usually) aligns with their appointing
President and thus with a majority of some past Electoral College.
Gerrymandering can feel especially obnoxious when the "parentheses" around the
inner majorities are set politically --- thus it was the strategic shaping of
House districts that gave us the word `gerrymander`.

##### _WHEN DO WE WANT GERRYMANDERING?_

Here are two examples where such a winner-takes-all intermediate step may make
sense: we do not give a greater vote to those people with more brain cells.
Nor does the UN give a greater vote to more populous member states.  These
examples take as their atomic units of experience (to which they give equal
weight) the person or the state rather than the neuron or the person.  On the
other hand, one may dismiss those two examples: the first, as treating systems
(brains) radically more coordinated than human populations; the second, as an
artifact of compromise rather than a long-term optimum.

When we vote in order to aggregate *beliefs* and when each larger unit
agglomerates *correlated* smaller units, then we may aggregate more accurately
by weighing larger units equally.  But when we vote in order to aggregate
*preferences* then it may be more natural to give equal weight to whichever
unit we regard as experiencing utility (usually, the person).(\*\*\*\*)

(\*\*) compare with median-of-medians selection.

(\*\*\*\*) I'd need to stretch in this latter case to justify giving equal
weights instead to groups of people --- perhaps having one's preference
violated feels less bad if most of one's neighbors hold opposing preferences
(bounded-radius empathy); or perhaps there is less risk of violent rebellion or
unchecked resentment when a policy's supporters spread evenly throughout all
regions rather than concentrating in some far-away "capital of empire".

### Tension and balance

To reduce gerrymandering, we want to look beyond majority operations.  I think
of this as *keeping the tension* so that the choices of an individual in a
minority counts despite a clear majority.

##### _HOT POTATOES_

CONTINUITY (vs "gerrymander")


We may partially mitigate this sensitivity to sequencing by scheduling multiple
passes through the sequence of Senators so that each Senator ends up marking,
say, thrice.  I did not include this in the proposal's text since it seems
complicated and I have not convinced myself of its substantive value.

##### _BIAS-VARIANCE "GERRYMANDERING"_

Here's a weakness of the proposal.  Consider a (not implausibly) partisan
political atmosphere whose every appointee to the Appellate Courts is "very
red" or "very blue".  FILLIN TODO

### Game Theoretic Analysis of Whittling

Let us pretend that every senator is either red or blue; that the candidates
are ordered from most red to most blue without ties; that this ordering is
known to all senators; and that a red (blue) senator prefers the redder (bluer)
of any two candidates.  We set k=1 throughout.  Under these assumptions:

    THEOREM.  If there are R red senators and B blue senators, then any
    sequencing of the senators will whittle K=(R+B+1) candidates to the
    candidate that is more red (blue) than exactly R (B) of the candidates
    (call this the rank (B,R) candidate).

    PROOF.  (Note that with K=N+1, each senator eliminates.)

    We induct on the number R+B of senators.  The case of zero senators
    is clear.  Otherwise, some senator goes first.  Without loss they are red.
    They must select one out of R+B+1 many candidates to eliminate.  By the
    induction hypothesis, the overall winner will have rank-(B,R-1) among the
    remaining candidates.  This is the same as

        the rank-(B  ,R  ) candidate if the senator eliminates any candidate of rank (<B,>R)
        the rank-(B+1,R-1) candidate if the senator eliminates the candidate of rank ( B, R)
        the rank-(B+2,R-2) candidate if the senator eliminates any candidate of rank (>B,<R)

    The senator prefers the first option.  QED

 NOTE: it is strategic to vote truthfully/greedily by eliminating one's most
 undesired candidate.

 TODO: show elimination is strategic (never pass and never double-mark
 since K=N+1)

We analyze both individual voting and coordinated party-based voting.
We will keep k=1 and analyze various K's.
We will also analyze situations with a few hot potatos and a few chaotic
senators.
We won't analyze the interesting case of more diverse judge rankings (e.g.
multi-party).

    THEOREM.  If there are R red senators and B blue senators, then any
    sequencing of the senators will whittle K=((R+B)/2+1) candidates to the
    candidate that is more red (blue) than exactly R (B) of the candidates
    (call this the rank (B,R) candidate).

    PROOF. We induct on R+B.  So we consider consecutive pairs of senators.
