# Summary of the Postwar Justices

Here are the 33 members of SCOTUS appointed by the postwar Presidents (Truman
1945-10 through Biden 2022-11).  Whereas all 3(\*) of Reagan's appointments
were confirmed unanimously, each of the 12 Justices since has suffered at least
one dissent to their confirmation.  This marks what may be a political turning
point, so we report both postwar and postReagan statistics.

(\*) We do not count Reagan's elevation of Rehnquist from associate to chief.

## Prior Experience

Most Justices sat previously on the Federal Courts of Appeals and/or in the
DOJ's top four positions (AG, Deputy AG, Associate AG, Solicitor General).  The
Solicitor General has special significance in this context because they
represent the US before SCOTUS.  Here's a breakdown:

    EXPERIENCE      #POSTWAR        #POSTREAGAN

    DC Circuit      8 ~ 24%         5 ~ 41%
    Other Circuits  8 ~ 42%         6 ~ 50%
    DOJ            10 ~ 12%         1 ~  8%
    None of above   8 ~ 24%         0 ~  0%

    TOTAL          33 ~100%        12 ~100%

The postwar counts add to 34 rather than 33 because Thurgood Marshall was
"doubly qualified" with experience as both DAG and 2nd Circuit Judge.

*Trivia*: Burton and Minton were Senators from OH, IN.  Warren was CA's AG and
Governor.  Brennan Jr sat on the NJ Supreme Court.  Vinson and Goldberg were
non-DOJ Cabinet Secretaries.  Clark, Burger, and Scalia were Assistant AGs.

*Note*: the `DIS` column counts dissenting senators during confirmation.  We
regard acclamations as dissentless.  Most of the time most but not all of the
Senate votes.  AL and HI joined as States of the Union in 1959; AL but not HI
had Senators in office when (1959-05) Stewart was confirmed.
