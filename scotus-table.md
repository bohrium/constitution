# Summary of the Postwar Justices

Here are the 33 members of SCOTUS appointed by the postwar Presidents (Truman
1945-10 through Biden 2022-11).  Whereas all 3(\*) of Reagan's appointments
were confirmed unanimously, each of the 12 Justices since has suffered at least
one dissent to their confirmation.  This marks what may be a political turning
point, so we report both postwar and postReagan statistics.

(\*) We do not count Reagan's elevation of Rehnquist from associate to chief.

## Prior Experience

Most Justices sat previously on the Federal Courts of Appeals and/or in the
DOJ's top four positions (AG, Deputy AG, Associate AG, Solicitor General).  The
Solicitor General has special significance in this context because they
represent the US before SCOTUS.  Here's a breakdown:

    EXPERIENCE      #POSTWAR        #POSTREAGAN

    DC Circuit      8 ~ 24%         5 ~ 41%
    Circuits 2,7    6 ~ 18%         2 ~ 17%
    Other Circuits  8 ~ 24%         4 ~ 33%
    DOJ             4 ~ 12%         1 ~  8%

    None of above   8 ~ 24%         0 ~  0%
    TOTAL          33 ~100%        12 ~100%

The postwar counts add to 34 rather than 33 because Thurgood Marshall was
"doubly qualified" with experience as both DAG and 2nd Circuit Judge.

*Trivia*: Burton and Minton were Senators from OH, IN.  Warren was CA's AG and
Governor.  Brennan Jr sat on the NJ Supreme Court.  Vinson and Goldberg were
non-DOJ Cabinet Secretaries.  Clark, Burger, and Scalia were Assistant AGs.
